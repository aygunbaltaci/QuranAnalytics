PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

PREFACE. 


In the year 1842, a most generous offer made to me by the present Duke of Northumberland (then Lord Prudhoe) 
enabled me to undertake the composition of this work; and to His Grace's princely aid I have ever since been mainly 
indebted for the means of accomplishing the project thus originated. 

The object proposed Was not to do in English little more than what Golius and others had already done in Latin, 
by translating and composing from a few Arabic lexicons of the class of epitomes or abstracts or manuals; but to 
draw chiefly from the most copious Eastern sources; one of which, comprising in about one seventh part of its 
contents the whole of the celebrated Kamoos, I knew to exist in Cairo. There, also, I had reason to believe that I 
might find other sources unknown in Europe, and obtain more aid in the prosecution of my design than I 
could elsewhere; and thither, therefore, I betook myself for this purpose. 

On my arrival at Cairo, I first had recourse, for help in making my preparations, to an accomplished Arabic 
Scholar, the late M. Fulgence Fresnel, with whom, during a former residence in Egypt, I had contracted an intimate 
friendship. Previously informed by me of my project, he had tested the qualifications of several learned natives for 
the task of assisting me in collecting, transcribing, and collating, the materials from which my lexicon was to be 
composed; and he recommended to me, as the person whom he esteemed the most fit, the Sheykh Ibraheem 
(surnamed 'Abd-el-Ghaffar) Ed-Dasookee. To have engaged as my coadjutor a sheykh respected for his character 
and learning, and to have been disappointed in him, and obliged dismiss him, might have made him my enemy, and 
enabled and induced him to baffle my scheme; but my experience led me to believe that a person better qualified for 
the services that I required of him, than the Sheykh Ibraheem Ed-Dasookee, could not have been found by me in 
Cairo; and I had no occasion to employ any other assistant, except, occasionally, transcribers, under his supervision. 

The assistance that I received from my friend M. Fresnel was not limited to the favour mentioned above. With a 
generosity rarely equalled, he insisted upon transferring to me the most valuable of his Arabic manuscripts, to 
remain with me during the whole period of the composition of my lexicon, and in case of his death during that 
period to become my absolute property. Most deeply do 1 deplore his not having lived to see how greatly those 
precious manuscripts have contributed to the accuracy and value of my work, and to .have them restored to him. 
They consist of two copies of the Sihah and a copy of the Kamoos. One of the copies of the former lexicon is a 
manuscript of extraordinary excellence: it was finished in the year of the Flight 676 (A.D. 1277); and forms a large 
quarto-volume. The other copy of the same lexicon is in three volumes: the second volume surpasses in accuracy 
every other copy of the same work that I have seen, and is enriched with numerous important extracts, in its 
margins, from the celebrated Annotations of Ibn-Barree and EI-Bustee: the first volume is similarly enriched, and 
little inferior to the second in accuracy: the third is of the ordinary quality. The copy of the Kamoos, which is written 
in a very small and compact hand, and forms a single octavo-volume, I believe to be unique: it contains, in its 
margins, (with other annotations and with various readings,) copious extracts from the great work which is the main 
source of my own lexicon; and its text, of which the transcription was finished in the year of the Flight 1120 (A.D. 
1708-9), has been carefully collated. These valuable acquisitions I made almost immediately after my arrival at 
Cairo. 

It was indispensable, I believe, to the success of my undertaking, that I should most carefully avoid whatever 
might draw down disrespect from the ’Ulama of Cairo, or others of the Muslim inhabitants, either upon myself or 
upon the Sheykh who was to assist me in procuring the chief material for the composition of my work. For it was 
only by his means that I could reasonably hope to obtain the use of manuscripts in the libraries of mosques; that is, 
by his borrowing those manuscripts as though for his own use: and one of the librarians showed himself to be 
desirous of urging any pretext in order to refuse the loan of the work that I most needed. I therefore made my place

of residence” to be as far as I could from the quarters frequented by Franks, and conformed with such of the general 
usages of the Muslims as did not involve a profession of their religion. But my precautions did not suffice to secure 
me from every difficulty. Even the Viceroy, Mohammad Alee Pasha, though almost an absolute prince, could not 
enable me to overcome them. Hearing of my project, I know not how, he spontaneously informed me, by his Prime 
Minister, that he was desirous of showing his respect for my Patron by rendering me any assistance within his 
power. I replied that his Highness would very greatly aid me by granting me authority to demand the loan of certain 
manuscripts in the libraries of mosques. But it was feared that the wardens of the mosques would in this case urge 
the necessity of an order from the Sultan, or abstract considerable portions from those manuscripts and so defeat my 
plan. I could therefore only endeavour to obtain, according to the usual custom, through the sheykh my assistant, a 
small portion at a time of each of the required manuscripts: and even this I was unable to do until after the lapse of 
some weeks. In the mean time, however, I had the good fortune to acquire a large folio-volume, consisting of literally 
the whole of the first tenth portion, of a copy of the great work to which I have alluded before as comprising in about 
one seventh part of its contents the whole of the celebrated Kamoos. This work, entitled “Taj Al-Aroos a compilation 
from the best and most copious Arabic lexicons, in the form of a running commentary on the Kamoos, with 
necessary critical and other illustrations, original, and selected from various authors of high repute, fully justified my 
expectation. I found, from the portion before me, that it would of itself alone suffice to supply the means of 
composing an Arabic lexicon far more accurate and perspicuous, and incomparably more copious, than any hitherto 
published in Europe. But I should not have been satisfied with making use of it for such a purpose without being 
able to refer to several of the most important of the works from which it was compiled. 

Of these works, and others particularly deserving of notice, as well as of the Taj el-'Aroos itself, and of the 
principles of Arabic lexicology, I must now endeavour to give a brief account. In doing this, I shall frequently have 
occasion to cite the “Muzhir” of Es-Suyootee, a compilation of the utmost value to students in general, and more 
especially to lexicographers, of the Arabic language. Its author died in the year of the Flight 911, a date to be borne in 
mind in perusing my extracts from it. I possess a most excellent copy of it, (written by a learned man, the sheykh 
Nasr El-Hooreenee, with the exception of a portion which, while he was suffering from an attack of ophthalmia, was 
written for him by one of his disciples,) transcribed from the best that is known to exist in Cairo, (namely, that of Es- 
Seja'ee, in the library of the great mosque El-Azhar) and enriched with copious marginal notes. 

What is called the classical language of Arabia, often termed by the Arabs “the language of Ma'add,” and “the 
language of Mudar,” is a compound of many sister-dialects, very little differing among themselves, which were 
spoken throughout nearly the whole of the Peninsula before the religion of Mohammad incited the nation to spread 
its conquering armies over foreign countries. Before that period, feuds among the tribes throughout the whole extent 
of their territory, had prevented the blending of their dialects into one uniform language; but this effect of disunion 
was counteracted in a great measure by the institution of the sacred months, in which all acts of hostility were most 
strictly interdicted, and by the annual pilgrimage, which had obtained from time immemorial, and the yearly fair 
held at 'Okadh, at which the poets of various tribes, during a period of about a century before the birth of 
Mohammad, or perhaps during a somewhat longer period, contended for the need of general admiration.* 

* Respecting this 'fair, see some extracts from the first of M, Fresnel's "Lettres sur I'Histoirc des Arabcs avant I'lslamisme" in Note 18 to the first chapter 
of my Translation of the Thousand and One Nights.

PREFACE. 


viii 

“Katadeh says that the tribe of Kureysh used to cull what was most excellent in the dialects of the Arabs, so that 
their dialect became the most 'excellent of all.” (Taj el-Aroos, in article m and the like is said in the 9th Section of 
the Muzhir.) This assertion, however, is not altogether correct: for many of the children of the tribe of Kureysh, in 
the time of Mohammad, were sent into the desert to be there nursed in order to their acquiring the utmost 
chasteness of speech. Mohammad himself was sent to be nursed among the tribe of Sa’ad Ibn-Bekr Ibn-Hawazin, 
descendants of Mudar, but not in the line of Kureysh: and he is said to have urged the facts of his being of Kureysh 
and having grown up among the tribe of Sa’ad as the grounds of his claim to be the most chaste in speech of the 
Arabs. It is evident, therefore, that Kureysh, in his time, were less chaste in speech than some other tribes; though 
the truth of this asserted saying of his rests, I believe, only on the authority of Saadee, who may have forged it in 
order to raise the reputation of his own tribe for purity of speech. From distant tribes, Kureysh probably borrowed 
little. The dialect of Himyer, confined mainly to EI-Yemen, and allied much more to the Ethiopic and the Hebrew 
titan to the language of Ma'add, contributed to this last language little more than a small proportion of words. For 
our knowledge of it, which is very scanty, we are chiefly indebted to the researches of M. Fresnel, who discovered a 
surviving idiom of it, spoken' chiefly in the district of Mahreh, between Hadramowt and 'Oman: hence it has been 
termed “Mahree;” and from the name of the tribe who speak it, M. Fresnel gave it the appellation of “Ehhkili,” or 
“Ehkili.” The author of the “Mishal” (EI-Feiyoomee) says, in article “j$-” The language of the people of Mahreh, 
which is n district of 'Oman, is quick, and scarcely, or not at all, intelligible [to other Arabs], and is of the ancient 
Himyeree.” 

The language of Ma’add was characterized by its highest degree of perfection, copiousness, and uniformity, in 
the time of Mohammad; but it soon after declined, and at length lost almost all that constituted its superiority over 
the other branches of the Semitic stock ill the states in which these are known to us. It is evident that all the Semitic 
languages diverged from one form of speech: and the known history of the Arabic is sufficient, I think, to show that 
the mixture of the several branches of the Shemites, in different degrees, with different foreign races, was the main 
cause, if not of the divergence, at least of the decay, of their languages, as exemplified by the Biblical Hebrew and 
Chaldee, and the Christian Syriac. That their divergence also was thus mainly caused, we cannot prove; but that this 
was the case I do not doubt, judging from the differences in their vocabularies, more especially from the differences 
of this kind in the Hebrew and Phoenician from the other Semitic languages. The existence of at least one language 
widely differing from the Semitic very long before the age of Moses is proved by the remains of the ancient Egyptian, 
from the time of the Pyramids; a language predominantly Semitic in its grammar, but predominantly Non-Semitic in 
its vocabulary; and evidently a compound of two heterogeneous forms of speech. The opinion, common among the 
learned of the Arabs, that the Arabic is the offspring of the Syriac, apparently suggested by a comparison of their 
vocabularies and by false notions of development, is simply absurd, unless by “the Syriac” we understand a lost 
language very different from that which is known to us by this appellation.* Every language without a written 
literature tends to decay more than to development by reason of foreign influences; and the history of the Arabic 
exhibits an instance of decay remarkably rapid, and extraordinary in degree. An immediate consequence of the 
foreign conquests achieved by the Arabs under Mohammad's first four successors was an extensive corruption of 
their language: for the nations that they subdued were naturally Obliged to adopt in a great measure the speech of 
the conquerors, a speech which few persons have ever acquired in such a degree as to be secure from the 
commission of frequent errors in grammar without learning it from infancy. These nations, therefore, and the Arabs 
dwelling among them, concurred in forming a simplified dialect, chiefly neglecting to observe those inflections and 
grammatical rules which constitute the greatest difficulty of the classical Arabic: in the latter half of the first century 
of the Flight, this simplified dialect became generally spoken in the foreign towns and villages inhabited by the 
Arabs; and it gradually became the general language throughout the deserts, as well as the towns and villages, of 
Arabia itself. That such a change took place, in the language of the Arabs inhabiting foreign towns and villages, at 
this period, is shown by several anecdotes interspersed in Arabic works, and amply confirmed in the older Arabic 


Many among the Jews, the Syrians, and the Fathers of the Christian Church, held that the Aramaic or the Syriac was the language of Adam

lexicons and other lexicological works by instances of the necessity of appeals to contemporary Arabs of the desert, 
respecting points of grammar, by learned men whose parents lived in the first century of the Flight. The celebrated 
lexicologist EI-Asma’ee, who was born in the year of the Flight 123, and lived to the age of 92 or 93, was not a sound 
grammarian. (See De Sacy's “Anthol. Gr. Ar.” p. 49 of the Arabic text.) And even Seebaweyh, who was contemporary, 
during the whole of his comparatively short life, with EI-Asma'ee, appears to have erred in grammar. (See p. 133 of 
the present work.) Ibn-Seedeh says, in the “Mohkam; in art. J=> >*, (voce ^ j~) that EI-Asma’ee was not a 
grammarian: and in art. <-j jA, (voce v as pi. of JA) he re marks that Ibn-EI-Arabee (who calls A pi. of A 3 ^ ) 
was ignorant of grammar. 

In short, not a single instance is known of any one’s having acquired a perfect knowledge of the grammar of the 
classical Arabic otherwise than by being brought up among Arabs who retained that language uncorrupted. The 
Khaleefeh El-Weleed (who reigned near the close of the first century of the Flight), the son of 'Abd-EI-Melik, spoke 
so corrupt a dialect that he often could not make himself understood by the Arabs of the desert. A ridiculous 
instance of the mistakes occasioned by his use of the simplified language which is now current is related by Abu- 1 - 
Fida. The rapid progress of the corruption of the language among the learned is the more remarkable when it is 
considered that many of these, in the first and second centuries of the Flight, were very long-lived: for in a list of the 
most celebrated Arabic lexicologists and grammarians, in the 48th Section of the Muzhir, the first five whose lengths 
of life are defined attained the following ages: 92, 74, 93, 96 or 97 or 98 or 99, and 92 or 93: the first of these 
(Yoonus) was born in the year 90 of the Flight; and the last, in the year 123; this being EI-Asma'ee. This series of five 
is broken only by one, whose length of life is not known. In some few spots, the language of Ma'add long lingered; 
and it may perhaps even survive to the present day; as appears from the following curious statement in the Kamoos 
(article -^): “Akad is a certain mountain, near Zebeed, [a well known city in the western seaboard of EI-Yemen,] the 
inhabitants of which retain the chaste language:” to which is added in the Taj el-' Aroos, that they retain this 
language “to the present time [the middle of the eighteenth century]: and the stranger remains not with them more 
than three nights, [the period prescribed by the law for the entertainment of a stranger,] by reason of [their] fear for 
[the corruption of] their language.” But instances of the corruption of the classical Arabic are related (in the 44th 
Section of the Muzhir) as having occurred even in the life-time of Mohammad. 

Such being the case, it became a matter of the highest importance to the Arabs to preserve the knowledge of that 
speech which had thus become obsolescent, and to draw a distinct line between the classical and post-classical 
languages. For the former language was that of the Kuran and of the Traditions of Mohammad, the sources of their 
religious, moral, civil, criminal, and political code: and they possessed, in that language, preserved by oral tradition, 
for the art of writing, in Arabia, had been almost exclusively confined to Christians and Jews, -a large collection of 
poetry, consisting of odes and shorter pieces, which they esteemed almost as much for its intrinsic merits as for its 
value in illustrating their law. Hence the vast collection of lexicons and lexicological works composed by Arabs, and 
by Muslims naturalized among the Arabs; which compositions, but for the rapid corruption of the language, would 
never have been undertaken. In the aggregate of these works, with all the strictness that is observed in legal 
proceedings, as will presently be shown, the utmost care and research have been employed to embody everything 
that could be preserved or recovered of the classical language; the result being a collection of such authority, such 
exactness, and such copiousness, as we do not find to have been approached in the case of any other language after 
its corruption or decay. 

The classical language they called, by reason of its incomparable excellence, “el-Ioghah,” or “the language:” and 
the line between this and the post-classical was easily drawn, on account of the almost sudden commencement, and 
rapid progress, of the corruption. It was decided by common consent, that no poet, nor any other person, should be 
taken as an absolute and unquestionable authority with respect to the words or their significations, the grammar, or 
the prosody, of the classical language, unless he were one who had died before the promulgation of El-Islam, or who 
had lived partly before and partly after that event; or, as they term it, unless he were a “Jahilee” or a “Mukhadram,” 
or (as some pronounce it) “Mukhadrim,”or “Muhadram,” or Muhadrim.” A poet of the class next after the 
Mukhadrams is termed an “Islamee:” and as the corruption of the language had become considerable in his time, 
even among those who aimed at chasteness of speech, he is not cited as an authority absolutely and unquestionably 
like the two preceding classes. A poet of the next class, which is the last, is termed a “Muwelled:” he is absolutely

post-classical; and is cited as an unquestionable authority with respect only to the rhetorical sciences. The 
commencement of the period of the Muwelleds is not distinctly stated: but it must have preceded the middle of the 
second century of the Flight; for the classical age may be correctly defined as having nearly ended with the first 
century, when very few persons born before the establishment of El-Islam through Arabia were living. Thus the best 
of the' Islamee poet may he regarded, and are generally regarded, as holding classical rank, though hot as being 
absolute authorities with respect to the words and the significations, the grammar, and the prosody, of the classical 
language. The highest of all authorities, however, on such points, prosody of course excepted, is held by the Arabs to 
be the Kuran. The Traditions of Mohammad are also generally held to be absolute authorities with respect to 
everything relating to the prose of the classical language; but they are excluded by some from the class of absolute 
authorities, because traditions may be corrupted in language, and interpolated, and even forged. Women are often 
cited as authorities of equal rank with men: and in like manner, slaves reared among the Arabs of classical times are 
cited as authorities equally with such Arabs. (See the word Alii in the present work; and see also AaU and 
and and AA) 

The poetry of the Jahilees and Mukhadrams consists, first, of odes (termed plural of A^), which were 
regarded as complete poems, and which were all designed to be chanted or sung. Secondly, of shorter compositions, 
termed pieces (A^, plural of -A-La); many of which were also designed to be chanted or sung: and thirdly, of couplets, 
or single 'Verses. In the first of these classes are usually included all poems of more than fifteen verses: but few 'odes 
consist of much less than fifty verses or much more than a hundred. Of such poems, none has been transmitted, and 
none is believed to have existed, of an age more than a few generations (probably not more than three or four or five) 
anterior to that of Mohammad. It is said in the 49th Section of the Muzhir, on the authority of Mohammad Ibn- 
Selam El-Jumahee, that “the pristine Arabs had no poetry except the few verses which a man would utter in his 
need: and odes qaseedehs) were composed, and poetry made long, only [for the first time] in the age of 'Abd-EI- 
Muttalib [Mohammad's grandfather], or Hashim Ibn-' Abd-Menaf [his great-grandfather]. And shortly after, in the 
same Section of that work, it is said, on the same authority, that the first who composed poems of this kind was EI- 
Muhelhil Ibn-Rabee'ah Et-Teghlibee, on the subject of the slaughter of his brother Kuleyb:” “he was maternal 
uncle of Imra-el-Keys* Ibn-Hojr EI-Kindee.” “Or, according to 'Omar Ibn-Shebbeh, each tribe claimed priority for its 
own poet; and not merely as the author of two or three verses, for such they culled not a poem: the Yemanees 
claimed for Imra-el-Keys; and Benoo-Asad, for 'Abeed Ibn-EI-Abras; and Teghlib, for [El]- Muhelhil; and Bekr, for 
'Amr Ibn-Kamee-ah and EI-Murakkish EI-Akbar; and Iyad, for Aboo-Du-ad: and some assert that EI-Afwah EI- 
Azdee was older than these, and was the first who composed kaseedehs: but these for whom priority in poetry was 
claimed were nearly contemporary; the oldest of them probably not preceding the Flight by a hundred years, 
or thereabout. Thaalab says, in his 'Amalee,' EI-Asma'ee says that the first of the poets of whom is related a poem 
extending to thirty verses is [El] -Muhelhil: then, Dhu-eyb Ibn-Ka’ab Ibn-Amr Ibn-Temeem Ibn Damreh, a man of 
Benoo-Kinaneh; and EI-Adbat Ibn-Kureya: and he says, Between these and El-Islam was four hundred years: and 
Imra-el-Keys was long after these.” But this is inconsistent with the assertion of Ibn-Selam mentioned above, made 
also by En-Nawawee in his “Tahdheeb el-Asma,” p. 163, that EI-Muhelhil was maternal uncle of Imra-el-keys: and 
as the majority refer EI-Muhelhil to a period of about a century before the Flight, we have a double reason for 
holding this period (not that of four hundred years) to be the more probably correct. According to Ibn-Kuteybeh, the 


* This name is generally pronounced thus, or" Imr-el-Keys," by the in the last instance without hemzeh, because (as is said in the Tahdheeb 
learned among the Arabs in the present day; for most of them regard as a and the Taj el-'AIroos on the authority of El-Kisa-ee and El-Farra) this 
pedantic to pronounce proper names in the classical manner. The classical letter is often dropped, 
pronun-ciation is “Imrau-l-Keys” and “Imruu-l-Keys” and “Imru-I-Keys;”

time of Imra-el-Keys was forty years before that of Mohammad; as is stated in the Calcutta edition of the Mo'allakat. 
M. Fresnel contends that the honour commonly ascribed to EI-Muhelhil is due to Zuheyr Ibn-Jena’b EI-Kelbee, of 
whose poetry at least seventy-nine verses have been preserved, fragments of different poems, including a piece of 
fifteen verses, of which the first hemistich of the first verse rhymes with the second hemistich, according to rule. But 
this Zuheyr, during a portion of his life, is related to have been contemporary with El- Muhelhil. In a fragment 
ascribed to him, he represents himself (if the fragment be genuine) to have lived two hundred years: and one 
tradition assigns to him a life of two hundred and fifty years: another, four hundred years; and another, four 
hundred and fifty years!* -Upon the whole, then, it seems that we may with probability refer the first kaseedeh to a 
period within a century and a half, at the utmost, before the Flight. 

Mohammad said, on being asked, “Who is the best of the poets, “Imr-el-Keys will be the leader of the poets to 
Hell.” And in the general estimation of the Arabs, he is the most excellent of all the poets. His Mo'allakah is most 
especially admired by them. Of the pagan and unbelieving poets who flourished before and during the time of 
Mohammad, El-Beydawee sarcastically remarks (on chap, 26. verses 224 and 225 of the Kuran, in which, and the 
verse that next follows, they are censured as seducers, bewildered by amorous desire, and vain boasters,) “Most of 
their themes are unreal fancies, and their words chiefly relate to the description of the charms of women under 
covert, and amorous dalliance, and false arrogations or professions, and the rending of reputations, and the 
impugning of the legitimacy of parentages, and false threatening, and vain boasting, and the praise of such as do not 
deserve it, with extravagance therein.” The like is also said in the Keshshaf, (on the same passage of the Kuran) and 
in too large a degree we must admit it to be just; but it is very far from being unexceptionable. The classical poetry is 
predominantly objective, sensuous, and passionate; with little imagination, or fancy, except in relation to phantoms, 
or speetres, and to jinn, or genii, and other fabulous beings; and much less artificial than most of the later poetry, 
many of the authors of which, lacking the rude spirit of the Bedawees, aimed chiefly at mere elegancies of diction, 
and plays upon words. Generally speaking, in the classical poetry, the descriptions of nature of the life of the desert, 
of night-journeyings and day-journeyings, with their various incidents, of hunting, and stalking, and lurking for 
game, of the tending of camels, of the gathering of wild honey, and similar occupations, are most admirable. And 
very curious and interesting, as will be shown by many citations in the present work, arc its frequent notices (mostly 
by early Muslim poets) of the superstitions that characterized, in the pagan times, the religion most generally 
prevailing throughout Arabia; in which, with the belief in a Supreme Deity, with strange notions of a. future state, 
and with angelolatry, astrolatry and idolatry, was combined the lowest kind of fetishism, chiefly the worship of rocks 
and stones and trees, probably learned from Negroes, of whom the Arabs have always had great numbers as slaves, 
and with whom they have largely intermixed. Sententious language consisting of parallel clauses, like that of the so- 
called” poetical books” of the Bible, was probably often employed by the Arabs of every age, it seems to be almost 
natural to their race when excited to eloquence. But the addition of rhyme in this style of language nippers to have 
become common in the Inter times, Mohammad Ibn-Et-Teiyib EI-Fasee says (in article of his Annotations on 
the Kamoos) that the oration termed in the Pagan and the early Muslim ages, was, in most instances, not in 
rhyming prose. The remains of classical prose are often used as authorities; but being more liable to corruption, they 
are regarded as less worthy of reliance than the poetry. +

t Those who desire to pursue the study of the history of the classical 
Arabic beyond the limits to which I have here confined my remarks, 
together with that of its sister-languages, will find much learned and 
valuable information in M. Renan's "Histoire Generate et Systeme 
Compare des Langues Semitiques;” though his scepticism in relation to the 
questions merely philological (as well all to sacred matters) is often, in my 


opinion, ill-grounded and unreasonable. I must particularly remark upon 
his erroneous assertion that the poems of the age anterior to El-Islam 
make no allusion to the ancient religions of Arabia, and hence appear to 
have been expurgated by Muslims, so as to efface all traces of paganism. 
Many of such allusions, by pagan poets, might be adduced from lexicons, 
grammars, and scholia; and some examples of them will be found in the 
present work, in articles and and jj* &c.; the [first

Such are the principal original sources from which the Arabic lexicons and lexicological works have been 
derived. Another source consisted of phrases and single words transmitted from the Arabs of classical times, or from 
those later Arabs of the desert who were believed (though they were not regarded as unquestionable authorities) to 
have retained the pure language of their ancestors. The earlier of these are often called, by the lexicologists, til 1 ilfyill 
Aj; as in the 1st Section of the Muzhir, where it is said that the transmission (J&ll) should be “from such as m j*- 3 ' 
■qJ-aJl, like [the descendants of] Kahtan and Ma'add and 'Adnan; not from those after them; after the corruption of 
their language, and the varying of the Muwelleds.” El-Jowharee, as will presently be seen, applies the 
appellation v j* 3 ' 1 '* 3 Cj even to desert-Arabs of his own time; but in doing so, he deviates from the general usage of 
the lexicologists. As is said in the 6th Section of the Muzhir, the transmitter must be a trustworthy person; but may 
be a woman, and may be a slave, as we have before stated. The degrees of credit to which the phrases and words thus 
transmitted are entitled are distinguished by ranging them in the following classes: 1st, (as is stated in the 3rd 
Section of the Muzhir,) the term Ayu is applied to that which has been transmitted by such a number of persons as 
cannot be supposed to have agreed to a falsehood : 2ndly, (plural of A-0, to what have been transmitted by some 
of the lexicologists, but are wanting in that which is required to justify the application, thereto, of the former term; 
and what is thus transmitted is also termed 3 ijj^rdly, (as is said in the 5th Section,) 333 A (plural of 33 A), to what 
have been transmitted by only one of the lexicologists ; and what is thus transmitted, if the transmitter is a person of 
exactness, as Aboo-Zeyd and El-Khaleel and others, is admitted : 4thly, (as is said in the 15th Section,) (plural 
of ^ jA“), to words known to be spoken only by one Arab. It was only when all other sources failed to supply what was 
wanted, that recourse was had, by the writers of lexicons and lexicological works, to contemporary Arabs of the 
desert; and I do not find that much reliance was often placed upon these after the end of the third century of the 
Flight. El-Jowharee, who died near the close of the next century, states, in the short preface to his “ Sihah,” that what 
he had collected in El-Irak for his lexicon he “rehearsed by lip to [those whom he terms] AA* 3 ' -ha*- 31 in their abodes 
in the desert (%’A) but this he seems to have done rather to satisfy any doubts that he may have had, and to obtain 
illustrations, than with the view of taking such persons as authorities for words or phrases or significations. It is 
related of Aboo-Zeyd, in the 7th section of the Muzhir, that he said, “I do not say ’the Arabs say’ unless I have heard 
it from these: Bekr Ibn-Hawazin and Benoo-Kilab and Benoo- Hilal; or from [the people of] the higher portion of the 
lower region, or [of] the lower of the higher:”* and that Yoonus used the expression “the Trustworthy (Aill) told me 
from the Arabs;” that being asked, “Who is the Trustworthy 1” he answered, “Aboo-Zeyd;” and being asked, “And 
wherefore dost thou not name him?” he answered, “He is a tribe, so I do not name him.”+ 

Most of the contents of the best Arabic lexicons were committed to writing, or to the memories of students, in 
the latter half of the second century of the Flight, or in the former half of the next century. Among the most 

region is "what is above Nejd, to the land of Tihdmeh, to the part 

behind Mekkeh; and certain towns, or villages, outside El-Medeeneh." 

t The exclusion of post-classical words and significations in the best 
Arabic lexicons, or their specification as such when they occur therein, is of 
very great importance to us in the use that we are often obliged to make of 
those lexicons in interpreting the Hebrew Scriptures. Thus the triumph of 
El-Islam, by occasioning the corruption of the Arabic language and the 
composition of such lexicons, has rendered us a most signal service. I have 
seldom noticed correspondences between the Arabic on the one side and 
the Hebrew and other Semitic languages on the other, because, though 
these are often illustrated by means of the incomparable copiousness of the 
Arabic, the Arabic is rarely illustrated by them, and because we have no 
such authorities for the interpretation of those languages as we have for the 
interpretation of the Arabic. 


first of these from the Mo'allakah of Imra-el-Keys. It would have been 
strange, indeed, if this had not been the case: for, except the Koran, 
nothing was so highly prized by the lexicologists as the pagan poetry: every 
fragment of it was most valuable in their estimation, and most carefully 
sought after and preserved and the intentional corruption of it they 
regarded as almost a crime. 

* "Aboo-'Amr said, 'The most chaste in speech, of men, are the higher 
[in respect of territory] of [the tribe of] Temeem, and the lower of [the tribe 
oQ Keys:' and Aboo-Zeyd said, 'The most chaste in speech, of men, are [the 
people of] the lower portion of the higher region, and the higher of the 
lower,' meaning the rear of [the tribe of] Hawazin ; the people of the higher 
region being the people of El-Medeeneh, and those around it, and those 
next it, and those near it, whose dialect he held to be not the same as that 
[of Hawazin]." (Muzhir, 49th Section.) According to the Famous, the higher

celebrated lexicological works, general and special, of this period, are the “Eyn,” commonly ascribed to El-Khaleel, 
who died in the year of the Flight 160 or 170 or 175 (aged 74); the “Nawadir” of El-Kisa-ee, who died in 182 or 183 or 
189 or 192; the “ Jeem” and the “Nawadir” and the work entitled “ El-Ghareeb el-Musannaf” of Aboo-'Amr Esh- 
Sheybanee, who died in 205 or 206 or 213 (aged 110 or 111 or 118); the “Nawadir” and the “Light” of El-Farra, who 
died in 207 (aged 67); the “Light” of Aboo-'Obeydeh, who died in 208 or 209 or 210 or 211 (aged 96 or 97 or 98 or 
99); the “Nawadir” and the “Light” of Aboo-Zeyd, who died in 214 or 215 or 216 (aged 93); the “ Aims” of El-Asma'ee, 
who died in 215 or 216 (aged 92 or 93) ; the work entitled “El-Ghareeb el-Musannaf’ of Aboo-'Obeyd, who died in 
223 or 224 or 230 (aged 67) ; and the “ Nawadir” of Ibn-El-Aarabee, who died in 231 or 233 (aged 81 or 83): all 
mentioned near the close of the 1st Section of the Muzhir. From these and similar works, either immediately or 
through the medium of others in which they are cited, and from oral tradition, and, as long as it could be done with 
confidence, by collecting information from Arabs of the desert, were composed all the best lexicons, and 
commentaries on the classical poets &c. The most authoritative of such works are the lexicons; and the most 
authoritative of these are, of course, generally speaking, the later, because every succeeding lexicographer profited 
by the critical research of his predecessors, and thus avoided or corrected errors committed by earlier authors. 
The commentaries on the poets and on the Traditions have contributed largely to the lexicons. They often present 
explanations that have been disallowed or questioned by eminent lexicographers; and therefore their statements, 
when unconfirmed by other authorities, must be received with caution: but in many cases their explanations are 
unquestionably accurate, and they afford valuable aid by giving examples of words and phrases of doubtful 
meanings. The danger of relying upon a single early authority, however high that authority may be, in any matter of 
Arabic lexicology, will be shown by innumerable instances in the present work. I here speak of errors of judgment. In 
addition to these, we have mistranscriptions. A word once mistranscribed is repeated in copy after copy; and 
at length, from its having been found in several copies, is confidently regarded as correct.* The value of the larger 
and later and more esteemed lexicons cannot, therefore, be too highly rated. 

The first of the general lexicons is that which is commonly ascribed to El-Khaleel, entitled the “’Eyn” (jAl' 4-L&); 
and this has served in a great measure as the basis of many others. In it the words are mentioned according to their 
radical letters, as in all the best lexicons ; but the letters are arranged, with the exception of ' and <. s which are classed 
with j for obvious reasons, nearly in the order of their places of utterance, as follows ; commencing with £ (whence 
the title): 

^ t j ^ cj j J J Cj Cj jia j L>“ o- 3 Cr* d* £ ^ 3 t- C ° C & 

Under each of these letters, in the foregoing order, except the last three which are necessarily classed together, are 
mentioned all the words of which the roots contain that letter without any letter of those preceding it in this 
arrangement : first, the biliteral-radical words : then, the triliteral-radical ; of which are placed first the sound ; 
secondly the unsound in one letter ; and thirdly the unsound in two letters : next, the quadriliteral-radical : and 
lastly, the quinqueliteral-radical. Thus, under the letter £ are mentioned all the words of which the roots contain that 
letter: under £, all the words of which the roots contain that letter without under », all of which the roots contain 
that letter without £ or and so on. For instance, in the section of the letter J, we find, in the first division, first, <jJ; 
then, and A; and so on: and in the second division, first, JL and then, and J 4 ; and so on: all the combinat-

ions of the same radical letters being arranged consecutively; and the same order of the letters being observed in all 
cases. Respecting the question of its authorship, which is involved in much uncertainty, I have gathered from the 1st 
Section of the Muzhir what here follows. Es-Seerafee says that El-Khaleel composed the first part of the 'Eyn. But 
most men deny [absolutely] its being his composition. Some say that it is by Leyth [or El-Leyth] Ibn-Nasr Ibn-Seiyar 
El-Khurasanee. El-Azheree says that El-Leyth composed it, and ascribed it to El-Khaleel in order that it might 
become in much request. Some say that El-Khaleel composed the portion from the beginning to the end of the letter 
£, and El-Leyth completed it; and therefore it is that the first part does not resemble the rest. Ibn-El-Moatezz relates, 
on the authority of the “ Moajam el-Udaba” of Yakoot El-Hamawee, that El-Khaleel made himself solely and 
peculiarly an associate of El-Leyth ; and when he composed the 'Eyn, assigned it to him : that El-Leyth held it in very 
great estimation, and gave him a hundred thousand [dirhams] ; and committed the half of it to memory:* but it 
happened that he purchased a highly-prized female slave ; whereupon the daughter of his paternal uncle, [i. e. his 
wife,] becoming jealous, and desiring to enrage him, which she could not do with respect to money as he would not 
care for her doing this, burned that book : and as no one else possessed a copy of it, and El-Khaleel had then died, 
El-Leyth dictated the half that he retained in his memory, and employed persons to complete it uniformly with that 
half : and they made this composition which is in the hands of men. To account for the mistakes occurring in the 
'Eyn, Thaalab says, “El-Khaleel sketched it out, but did not fill it up ; and had he filled it up, he had spared nothing in 
it; for El-Khaleel was a man of whom the like has not been seen : certain learned men filled it up, on whose authority 
nothing has been related.” It is also said that El-Khaleel composed, of this book, only the section of the letter £, and 
his companion El-Leyth composed the rest, and named himself “El-Khaleel” (i. e. “the friend”); and that when he 
says, in the book, “El-Khaleel Ibn- Ahmad says,” it is El-Khaleel; and when he says, absolutely, “El-Khaleel says,” he 
speaks of himself : and that every flaw in the book is from him ; not from El-Khaleel. En- Nawawee says that, 
according to some of the learned,] the 'Eyn ascribed to El-Khaleel is only what El-Leyth collected from El-Khaleel.t 
The mistakes in the 'Eyn are numerous; and there are many interpolations in copies thereof. Several authors have 
applied themselves to point out and correct these faults: some, in works specially devoted to this object: some, in 
abridgments of the 'Eyn or in other lexicons. But in general the mistakes are confined to matters of inflection and 
derivation; not extending to the insertion of false or unknown words: and such mistakes are of light accounts. 

The following notices of other celebrated lexicons, composed after the 'Eyn, so far as to include the Kamoos, I 
borrow chiefly from the same section of the Muzhir; distinguishing my own additions by enclosing them within 
square brackets 

Among other celebrated lexicons composed after the model of the 'Eyn, is the “Jemaah” of Ibn-Dared, [who 
died in the year of the Flight 321, and is said to have lived 93 years.] Some say that it is one of the best of lexicons; 
and it has been taken as an authority by Aboo-'Alee El-Farisee and Aboo-'Alee El-Kalee and Es-Seerafee and other 
eminent authors. Ibn-Jinnee disparages it for faults similar to those of the Eyn: and Niftaweyh, whom Ibn-Dureyd 
had satirized, pronounced it to be untrustworthy; but without justice. 


* Many of the Arabs have been remarkable for a tenacity of memory I Dictionary, page 231,) that, according to some of the learned, "much of 
almost miraculous. At school, they generally learn the whole of the Koran what El-Azheree has transcribed in the Tahdheeb el-Loghah from the 'Eyn

students, among them, when unable to purchase works neces sary to them, in which the Tahdheeb is held by lexicographers of the highest repute. El-

The “Tahdheeb” of El-Azheree, [who was born in the year of the Flight 282, and died in the year 370 or 371. This 
is a very excellent lexicon, and one from which I have largely drawn, immediately and through the medium of the 
Lisan el-'Arab and of the Taj el-'Aroos. Its arrangement is the same as that of the 'Eyn, which it calls “the book of El- 
Leyth,” and from which its contents are in a great measure derived. I possess a large portion of this work in a volume 
of the “Tahdheeb et-Tahdheeb;” and a small portion, consisting of 193 pages, of a copy in large 8 vol., corresponding 
to a part of the former.] 

The “Moheet” of the Sahib Ibn-'Abbad. [Ibn-Khillikan* states that he was born in the year of the Flight 326, and 
died in 385: and describes this work as “in seven volumes; arranged in the order of the letters of the alphabet; 
copious in words, but having few confirmatory examples:” thus resembling the Kamoos. Much has been drawn from 
it in my own lexicon.] 

The “Mujmal” of Ibn-Faris, [who died in the year of the Flight 395.] He restricted himself, in his lexicon, to the 
mention of genuine words; excluding the unfamiliar and ignored; on the authority of oral tradition, and from books 
of good repute; aiming, as he says, at abridgment and conciseness. [His work is highly esteemed. The arrangement is 
that of the usual order of the letters of the alphabet.] 

The “Sihah,” or, as some call it, “Sahah,” of El-Jowharee, [commonly, now, pronounced “ El- J6haree,” who 
died, according to Abu-l-Fida, in the year of the Flight 398, and “was from Farab, a city of the country of the Turks, 
beyond the river,” that is, beyond the Seyhoon : or, according to Ibn-Esh-Shihneh, he died in the year 397, as I find 
in two copies of his history in my possession*]. Et-Tebreezee says that it is commonly known by the title of the 
which is pi. of 5?-=; but that some call it the which is synonymous with je— 3 - As its title imports, the author 
restricted himself to the mention of genuine words, like Ibn-Faris, his contemporary. [But his lexicon is far more 
comprehensive, and more excellent in every respect, than that of Ibn-Faris.] As he says in his preface, he composed 
it in an order which none had before pursued, [mentioning each word according to the place of the last letter of the 
root; and then the first and second, in the usual order of the alphabet,] after collecting the contents in El-'Irak, and 
rehearsing them by lip [as I have before mentioned] to [those whom he terms] AjUll mA 11 in their abodes in the 
desert (A-sUll). Eth-Tha'alibee says that he was one of the wonders of the age. His lexicon, however, is not free from 
instances of inadvertence or mistakes, like all great books; and such as cannot be attributed to the copyists. Yakoot 
says, in the “ Moajam el-Udaba,” that the cause of the mistranscriptions in it was this : when he had composed it, it 
was read to him as far as [the section of] the letter cA=, and an evil suggestion occurred to his mind, in consequence of 
which he cast himself from a housetop, and died : so the rest of the book remained a rough draught, not pruned, or 
trimmed, nor fairly copied out; and his disciple Ibraheem Ibn-Salih El-Warrak made a fair copy of it, and committed 
mistakes in some places in it. Ibn-Barree wrote a commentary, or series of annotations, EA jp- plural of A2UJ on the 
Sihah, [an extremely valuable work,] in which he reached the middle [of the section] of the letter os and the sheykh 
Abd- Allah Ibn-Mohammad El-Bustee completed it. [But I have invariably found passages from every part of it cited 
as the sayings of Ibn-Barree.] And Es-Saghanee, or, as he is called by some, Es-Saghanee, wrote a Tekmileh i. 
e. Supplement) to the Sihah; exceeding it in bulk. [Some further remarks on the Sihah (my own copies of which have 
been already described) will be found in my account of the Kamoos. The abridgment entitled “Mukhtar es- Sihah” is 
well known: it is too scanty to be of much use except to those who desire to commit to memory the most usual words 
and significations. Avery superior abridgment is the “Jami”’ of the Seyyid Mohammad Ibn-es-Seyyid-Hasan, which 
was finished, according to Hajjee Khaleefeh, in the year of the Flight 854. It is copious, well digested, and enriched 
with additions from the Mughrib of El-Mutarrizee, the Faik of Ez-Zamakhsheree, the Nihayeh of Ibn-El-Atheer, &c. 
Of this work I possess a very good copy.] 


I have the express authority of the Taj el-' Aroos (in art. ~) for thus writing the name of this author.

The “Jami” of El-Kazzaz, [who died in the year of the Flight 412. Hajjee Khaleefeh mentions it as “an esteemed 
book, but rare.” It is not unfrequently cited in the Taj el-'Aroos.] 

The “Moo'ab” (thus, with fet-h to the £,) of Aboo-Ghalib Ibn-Temam, [or, according to Ibn-Khillikan, Aboo- 
Ghalib Temam,] known by the appellation of Ibn-Et-Teiyanee, [who died in the year of the Flight 436;] a work of 
very great utility, consisting of what is correct of the contents of the 'Eyn, not omitting anything of the confirmatory 
examples from the Koran and the Traditions and the genuine poems of the Arabs, but rejecting what it contains of 
examples respecting which there is disagreement, and of mistranscribed words, and faulty formations ; and adding 
what Ibn-Dureyd has added in the Jemharah. It is rarely found ; for people have not persevered in transcribing it, 
but have rather inclined to the Jemharah of Ibn-Dureyd and the Mohkam of Ibn-Seedeh and the Jami' of El-Kazzaz 
and the Sihah & c. 

The “Mohkam” of Ibn-Seedeh the Andalusian, who was blind, (as was also his father; and who died in the year 
of the Flight 458, aged about 60 years.] This is the greatest of the lexicological books (i. e. of the lexicons] composed 
since the age of the Sihah [to the time of the author of the Muzhir, of those known to him. It follows the 
arrangement of the Eyn; and it is held in very high estimation for its copiousness, its accuracy, its critical remarks, 
and its numerous examples from classical poets. In copiousness and in some other respects, it is superior, and in 
others hardly (if at all) inferior, to the Shah. It is one of the two chief sources of the Kamoos; the other being the 
'Obab of Es-Saghanee: and I have drawn from it very largely, both immediately and through the medium of the 
Lisan el-' Arab and of the Taj el-'Aroos, for my own lexicon. I possess the last fifth part of it in a volume of the 
“Tahdheeb et-Tahdheeb and another large portion, and a smaller portion, of a most admirable copy which has been 
dispersed, written in the year of the Flight 675, for the library of a Sultan, apparently the celebrated Beybars.] 

[The “Asas” of Ez-Zamakhsheree, who was born in the year of the Flight 467, and died in 538. This lexicon is a 
very excellent repertory of choice and chaste words and phrases ; and especially and peculiarly valuable as 
comprising a very large collection of tropical significations, distinguished as such, which has greatly contributed, by 
indirectly illustrating proper significations as well as otherwise, to the value of my own lexicon, as my numerous 
citations of it will show, although I have generally been obliged to draw from it through the medium of the Taj el- 
'Aroos, which often does not name it in quoting it. Its order is the same as that of the Mujmal, apparently in most 
copies: but some, which are said to be abridged, follow the order of the Sihah.] 

[The “Mughrib” of El-Mutarrizee, who was born in Khuwarezra, in the year of the Flight 536, and died in 610. 
This is a lexicon of select words and phrases, and particularly of such as occur in books of Traditions, and other 
works relating to the law. It forms a very valuable companion and supplement to the other lexicons; and I have 
constantly consulted it and drawn from it in composing the present work. Its arrangement of the roots is that of the 
usual order of the alphabet, with respect to the first, second, and third letters of each. I possess a very excellent copy 
of it, written in the year of the Flight 977, presented to me by the Rev. J. R. T. Lieder, late of the English Church- 
Mission in Cairo.] 

The “Obab” of Es-Saghanee, or Es-Saghanee, (who was born in the year of the Flight 577, and died in 660, 
according to the Muzhir (48th Section), or, as is said in the Taj el-'Aroos (art. _}*—=), in 655, on the authority of one 
who attended his funeral.] This, after the Mohkam, is the greatest of the lexicological works composed since the age 
of the Sihah [to the time of the author of the Muzhir, of those known to him. It was left unfinished. If, as I believe is 
the case, it follows the order of the Shah, the portion completed was somewhat more than three fourths; for] the 
author reached, in it, to the section of which occasioned the saying,

[“Verily Es-Saghanee, who mastered the sciences and the doctrines of philosophy, the utmost of his case was that he 
reached to ^ which signifies “dumbness,” &c, — Though a man of extensive learning, he was opiniative, and 
addicted to unjust criticism of his superiors. A copy of the 'Obab, and a copy of the same author's Supplement to the 
Sihah, before mentioned, used by the author of the Taj el-'Aroos, belonged to the library of the mosque of the Emeer 
Sarghatmish, in Cairo ; but on my causing an inquiry to be made for them, the librarian declared that they were no 
longer found there. They have probably been stolen; or had not been returned by the author of the Taj el-'Aroos 
when he died; on which occasion, it is said, his house was plundered of the books &c, that he left.] 

[The “Lisan el-' Arab” of Ibn-Mukarram, who was born in the year of the Flight 630, and died in 711. In the copy 
of his lexicon in the library of the collegiate mosque called the “ Ashrafeeyeh,” in Cairo, consisting of twenty-eight 
quarto- volumes, he is styled “ Jemal-ed-Deen Mohammad Ibn-esh-sheykh-el-imdm-el-marhoom-Jelal-ed-Deen- 
Abi-l-Tzz-Mukarram Ibn- esh-sheykh-Nejeeb-ed-Deen-Abi-l-Hasan-El-Ansdree but in the Taj el-'Aroos, he is 
almost always called Ibn-Mandhoor (jjhii A 1 ), I shall give an account of this great work in describing the Taj el- 
Aroos.] 

[The “Tahdheeb et-Tahdheeb” of Mahmood Et-Tanookhee, who died in the year of the Flight 723. It is a 
combination of the contents of the Mohkam and Tahdheeb (the former occupying the first place in each article) with 
a few additions from other sources. Thus it forms one of the best and most comprehensive of the Arabic lexicons, 
without any exceptions known to me but the Lisan el-'Arab and the Taj el-'Aroos. Of the original autograph copy of 
this work, in five full-paged, large quarto-volumes, I possess the last volume, consisting of 501 pages. I made a 
diligent search for the other volumes, but without success.] 

[The “Misbah” of El-Feiyoomee (Ahmad Ibn-Mohammad Ibn-'Alee El-Mukri). Its full title is “El-Misbah el- 
Muneer fee Ghareeb esh-Sharh el-Kebeer.” This is a lexicon similar to the Mughrib, above mentioned; but much 
more comprehensive; forming a most valuable companion and supplement to the larger lexicons. Notwithstanding 
its title, it comprises a very large collection of classical words and phrases and significations of frequent occurrence; 
in many instances with more clear and full explanations than I have found elsewhere. I have therefore constantly 
drawn from it in composing my own lexicon; possessing a very accurate copy of it, a full-paged quarto- volume of 
742 pages. Its author states in it that he finished its composition in the year of the Flight 734.] 

[The “Mughnee,” as it is commonly called, or “Mughni-l-Lebeeb,” of the celebrated grammarian Ibn-Hisham, 
who was born in the year of the Flight 708, and died in 761 or the following year. A large work, whereof a little more 
than one half consists of an elaborate lexicon of the particles and similar words, for which it is my chief authority, as 
it was, also, that of the author of the Kamoos, whose explanations of the particles are, however, very meager and 
unsatisfactory. I am fortunate in possessing a most excellent copy of it, a quarto-volume of 609 pages.] 

The “Kamoos” of El-Feyroozabddee, [or, as some pronounce it, El-Feyroozabddee, (from the city of Fer6zdbdd, 
or Feerozabad, pronounced by the Arabs Feyroozabad, or Feeroozabad,) who was born in the year of the Flight 729, 
and died in 816.* ] This, after the Mohkam and the 'Obab, is the greatest of the lexicological works composed since 
the age of the Sihah [to the time of the author of the Muzhir, of those known to him] : but none of these three [he 
adds] has attained to be as much used as the Sihah ; nor has the rank of the Sihah, nor its celebrity, been 
diminished by the existence of these ; because it is restricted to what is genuine, so that it is, among the books of 
lexicology, like the Sahah of El-Bukharee among the books of traditions ; for the point upon which turns the title to

mentioned, that he finished the transcription of that volume in Dhu-1- 
Hijj'eh 768.

reliance is not the copiousness of the collection, but the condition of genuineness, or correctness. [The judgment 
thus expressed, as to the rank and celebrity of the Shah, in comparison with the Kamoos, I have found to agree with 
the opinion of the most learned men among the Arabs with whom I have been acquainted. But to insinuate that the 
words and significations added in the latter of these lexicons to those of the former are generally less genuine, or less 
correct, is not just: they may be truly said to be generally less chaste, inasmuch as they are less usual: but their 
collector has undoubtedly rendered a great service to the students of Arabic by these additions, which have of late 
years caused the copies of his lexicon to become much more numerous than those of the Shah. The value of the 
Sihah consists in its presenting a very judicious collection of the most chaste words, with critical illustrations from 
the best of the lexicologists, and examples from the best of the classical poets. The Kamoos is little more than what 
may be termed an enormous vocabulary; a collection of words and significations from preceding lexicons and similar 
works, (for otherwise, according to the principles of Arabic lexicology as universally taught, they would be of no 
authority,) mainly from the Mohkam and the 'Obab; with very few critical observations, many of which are false,* 
and scarcely any examples from the poets. Thus it resembles the Moheet of Ibn-'Abbad, before mentioned. In order 
to make room for his numerous additions, desiring that the bulk of his book should be nearly the same as that of the 
Shah, the author has often abridged his explanations in such a manner as to render them unintelligible to the most 
learned of the Arabs, and has omitted much of what is most valuable of the contents of the latter work. But he has 
frequently deviated from this his usual practice for the purpose of inserting criticisms of others, without 
acknowledgment, and apparently some few of his own, upon points in the Sihah in which its author is asserted to 
have erred; and this he has often done so as to lead to the belief that the author of the Sihah has affirmed what he 
has merely quoted from another. Many of these criticisms I have found to have been borrowed from the Annotations 
on the Sihah by Ibn-Barree and El-Bustee, or from the Supplement to the Sihah by Es-Saghnee: generally when 
they are false, (which is often the case,) though sometimes when they are correct, from the latter of these works. I 
have felt it to be my duty to make these remarks in defense of El-Jowharee, and for the sake of truth. Abundant 
proofs of their correctness will be found in my own lexicon. They may surprise many, who have not known the fact 
that the Kamoos is very little more than an abridged compilation from other works: and another fact, to be 
mentioned in the next paragraph, which will be in a measure supplementary to this brief account of the Kamoos, will 
probably surprise them more. — This is the latest of the lexicons noticed in the Muzhir: therefore I have no further 
occasion for the use of the square brackets to distinguish my own statements or opinions from those of the author of 
that work, which has thus far afforded me so much aid in my account of the principles of Arabic lexicology, and of 
the most celebrated Arabic lexicons, as well as in my remarks on the history of the language. My own, most valuable, 
manuscript-copy of the Kamoos, which I have already described, has been of very great use to me, though its text is 
generally most correctly given in the Taj el-'Aroos. I have also constantly had before me the edition printed at 
Calcutta. This is certainly more accurate than most of the manuscript-copies; but it contains countless false 
readings, which show that, in many instances, the editor, notwithstanding his unquestionable learning and his 
possession of eleven copies, did not understand what he edited. It seems that he must often have given the worst of 
the readings of his originals, from neglecting to study the passages in which they occur. I have not thought it 
necessary to mention all of the false readings in his edition; but I have mentioned many of them.] 

The “Laimi'” of EI-Feyroozabddee. Its full title is “EI-Lami' el-Moalam el-'Obab el-Jami' beyn el-Mohkam wa-1- 
’Obab.” From some words in the preface to the Kamoos, it has been inferred that the author of that work had 
composed a lexicon in sixty volumes, bearing the foregoing title, from which, chiefly, he composed, or abridged, the 
Kamoos, in two volumes. But in a very learned work, of Annotations on the Kamoos, by Mohammad Ibn-Et-Teiyib 
El-Fasse, it is clearly shown that the words from, which this inference has been drawn really signify that the author 


* The judgment and memory of its author are often in fault: for 
instance, in article he disallows the expression fVA and in art. 
j he uses it ; and in article he disallows as syn. with and in 


article he authorizes it: and many similar instances might be 
mentioned.

of the Lami' commenced (not that he completed) this work, and made it, as far as it extended, to surpass every other 
work of a similar kind; but that he imagined it would be, in sixty volumes, too large for students to acquire or read ; 
and, being requested to compose before it a concise lexicon, he applied himself to the composition of the Kamoos, 
and abridged the matter of which the Lami' was to have consisted, so as to comprise the essence of each thirty of the 
intended volumes in one volume. Thus the words in question are so far from being a proof of the completion of the 
Limit', that their literal meaning indicates the very contrary of this. They are not, however, the only evidence that we 
have on this point : for the same eminent scholar to whose Annotations on the Kamoos I have referred above quotes, 
from the biographical memoir of the author of the Lami' in the “ Tabakat en-Nohah “ of Es-Suyootee, the direct 
assertion that this work was never completed. He also states, as does likewise the author of the Taj el-'Aroos, that 
more than one writer has transmitted, on the authority of the handwriting of its author, a proof of its non- 
completion : for they relate the fact of his having written upon the back of the Lime, that, if he had been able to 
complete it, it would have composed a hundred volumes, [of what size he does not give the least notion,] and that he 
completed five volumes of it. This, it should be observed, is not inconsistent with what has been said before: it 
appears that the work would have consisted of a hundred volumes, each of the size of one of the five volumes that 
were completed; or would have composed sixty larger volumes. But I rather incline to think that its author roughly 
calculated, at one time, that the whole would consist of a hundred volumes; and at another time, that it would 
consist of sixty; and that both estimates are greatly beyond the truth. The non-completion of the Limit' is therefore 
certain; but this is not so much to be regretted as some persons might imagine from its author's statement 
respecting it in his preface to the Kamoos; for the work appears, from its title, to have been, as far as it extended, 
with respect to the words and significations, mainly a compilation uniting the contents of the Hohokam and the 
'Obab, and neither of these lexicons has been lost to the world. From a reference to it in article of the Kamoos, (in 
which the author asserts his having disproved an opinion respecting the signification of w A-^ithout stating that El- 
Azheree had done so more than five centuries before,) it seems that the Lami' (seeing how small a portion of it was 
completed) followed the order of the 'Eyn and the Mohkam ; for article is in the third of the main divisions of 
these two works, but in the last but two of those of the Kamoos. Considering this fact, and that the main divisions of 
the 'Eyn and the Mohkam necessarily decrease in length from first to last, I suppose that the author of the five 
volumes of the Land' wrote them, agreeably with a common practice, with large margins for additions, and 
calculated that, with these additions, each of the five volumes would form at least three. 

The “ Taj el-'Aroos,” the enormous extent of which I have mentioned in the second paragraph of this preface, is 
said to have been commenced, in Cairo, soon after the middle of the last century of our era, by the Seyyid Murtada 
Ez-Zebeedee. At the end of a copy of it in his own handwriting, he states that it occupied him fourteen years and 
some days. According to the modern historian of Egypt, El-Jabartee, he was born A.D. 1732 or 1733: came to Cairo 
A.D. 1753: finished the Taj el-'Aroos A.D. 1767 or 1768: and died A.D. 1791 (in the year of the Flight 1205), And the 
same historian says that Mohammad Bey Abu-dh-Dhahab, for the copy of that work which is in the library of his 
mosque, gave him a hundred thousand dirhams (or drachms) of silver. It is a compilation from the best and most 
copious of the preceding Arabic lexicons and other lexicological works, in the form of an interwoven commentary on 
the Kamoos; exhibiting fully and clearly, from the original sources, innumerable explanations which are so abridged 
in the latter work as to be unintelligible to the most learned men of the East; with copious illustrations of the 
meanings & c, corrections of mistakes in the Kamoos and other lexicons, and examples in prose and verse ; and a 
very large collection of additional words and significations, mentioned under the roots to which they belong. Of the 
works from which it is compiled, though I believe that it was mainly derived in the first instance from the Lisan el-' 
Arab, more than a hundred are enumerated by the Seyyid Murtada in his preface. Among these are— 1 The “ Sihah,” 
a copy in eight volumes, in the handwriting of Yakoot Er-Roomee, with useful marginal notes determining the 
correct readings &c, by Ibn-Barree [and El-Bustee] and Aboo-Zekereeya Et-Tebreezee ; in the library [of the 
collegiate mosque) of the Emeer Ezbek.— 2 The “Tahdheeb” of El-Azheree, a copy in sixteen volumes.— 3 The 
“Mohkam” of Ibn-Seedeh, a copy in eight volumes.— 4 The “Tahdheeb el-Abniyeh wa-l-Af al,” by Ibn-El-Kattaa, in 
two volumes.— 5 The “ Lisan el-' Arab,” by the Imam Jemal-ed-Deen Mohammad Ibn-'Alee El-Ifreekee, [whose 
appellations I have more fully given before, commonly called (in the Taj el-'Aroos) “ Ibn-Mandhoor,”] in twenty- 
eight volumes, the copy transcribed from the original draught of the author, during his life-time: [of this copy I have 
often made, use in composing my own lexicon; and I have found it very helpful, especially in enabling me to supply 
syllabical signs, which are too often omitted in the copies of the Taj el-'Aroos:] its author followed closely, in its

composition, the Sihah A the Tahdheeb, the Mohkam, the Nihayeh, the Annotations of Ibn-Barree [and El-Bustee on 
the Sihah], and the Jemharah of Ibn-Dureyd : [he also drew from innumerable other sources, to which he refers in 
his work.]— 6 The “Tahdheeb et-Tahdheeb” of Abu-th-Thena Mahmood Ibn- Abee-Bekr Ibn-Hamid Et-Tanookhee, a 
copy in five volumes, (of which, as I have already mentioned, I possess the last,) the original draught of the author, 
who closely followed, in its composition, the Shah, the Tahdheeb, and the Mohkam, with the utmost accuracy: he 
died in the year of the Flight 723.-7 The “Kitab el-Ghareebeyn” of Aboo-'Obeyd El-Harawee.— 8 The “ Nihayeh fee 
Ghareeb el-Hadeeth,” by Ibn-El-Atheer [Mejd-ed-Deen] El-Jezeree.— 9 The “ Kifayet el-Mutahaffidh,” by Ibn-El- 
Ajdabee, with Expositions thereof.— 10 The “Faseeh” of Thaalab, with three Expositions thereof.— 11 and 12 The 
“Fikh el-Loghah” and the work entitled “El-Mudaf wa-l-Mensoob,” each by Aboo-Mansoor Eth-Tha'alibee.— 13 and 
14 The “ ’Obab” and the “ Tekmileh fi-s- Sihah,” each by Er-Radee Es-Saghanee, in the library (of the mosque) of the 
Emeer Sarghatmish.— 15 The “Misbah” [of El-Feiyoomee].— 16 The “Takreeb” of Ibn-Khateeb.— 17 The “Mukhtar es- 
Sihah,” by Er-Razee.— 18, 19, 20 The “Asas” and the “Fai'k” and the “Mustaksee fi-l-Amthal,” all three by Ez- 
Zamakhsheree.— 21 The “Jemharah” of Ibn-Dureyd, in four volumes, in the library [of the mosque] of El-Mu- 
eiyad.— 22 The “Islah el- Mantik” of Ibn-Es-Sikkeet.— 23 and 24. The “Khasaus” of Ibn-Jinnee, and the “Sirr es- 
Sina'ah” of the same author.— 25 The “Mujmal” of Ibn-Faris.— Many other works of great value are included in the 
same list. And the Annotations on the Kamoos by his preceptor, Mohammad Ibn-Et-Teiyib El-Fasee, (before 
mentioned, in my account of the Laini',) must be especially noticed as a very comprehensive and most learned work, 
from which the seyyid Murtada derived much valuable matter to incorporate in the Taj el-'Aroos. From these 
Annotations of Mohammad El-Fasee, which have often served to explain to me obscure passages in the Taj el-'Aroos, 
and from several others of the most celebrated of the works used by the seyyid Murtada, I have drawn much matter 
which he omitted as not necessary to Eastern scholars, but which will be found to be highly important to the Arabic 
students of Europe. He made very little use of a commentary on the Kamoos entitled the “Names,” by Mulla 'Alee el- 
Kari, as it is not a work held in high estimation, and he was most careful to include among his authorities none but 
works of high repute. It must also be mentioned that he has bestowed great pains upon the important task of settling 
the true text of the Kamoos, according to the authorities of several celebrated copies; and that he has inserted the 
various readings that he regarded as being worthy of notice. And here I may state that most of the illustrations of the 
text of the Kamoos that are incorporated in the Turkish translation of that work, whenever I have examined them, 
which has often been the case, I have found to be taken from the Taj el-'Aroos, of which the Translator ('Asim 
Efendee) is said to have had a copy in the author's handwriting : but generally speaking, what is most precious of the 
contents of the latter work has been omitted in that translation. 

As the Taj el-'Aroos is the medium through which I have drawn most of the contents of my lexicon, I must more 
fully state the grounds upon which I determined to make so great a use of it. Not long after I had become acquainted 
with this enormous work, I found it to be asserted by some persons in Cairo that the seyyid Murtada was not its 
author : that it was compiled by a certain learned man (whose name I could not ascertain) who, coming to Cairo with 
this work, on his way from Western Africa to Mekkeh as a pilgrim, and fearing to lose it in the desert-journey, 
committed it to the seyyid Murtada to be safely kept until his return : that he died during his onward-journey, or 
during his return towards Cairo : and that the seyyid Murtada published it as his own composition. This grave 
accusation brought against the reputed author of the Taj el-'Aroos, unsupported by the knowledge of the name of the 
person whom he is thus asserted to have wronged, I did not find to be credited by any of the learned, nor do I myself 
believe it: but it imposed upon me the necessity of proving or disproving, not the genuineness of the book (a matter 
of no importance except as affecting the reputation of the seyyid Murtada*), but, its authenticity. I was therefore 
obliged to make a most laborious collation of passages quoted in it with the same passages in the works quoted: and 
in every instance I found that they had been faithfully transcribed. Thus the authenticity of the Taj el-'Aroos was 
most satisfactorily established. But in comparing large portions of it with the corresponding portions of the Lisan el- 
'Arab, I made the unexpected discovery that, in most of the articles in the former, from three-fourths to about nine- 
tenths of the additions to the text of the Kanioos, and in many articles the whole of those additions, existed verbatim 
in the Lisdn el-'Arab. I cannot, therefore, acquit the seyyid Murtada of a want of candour, and of failing to render 
due honour to one of the most laborious of compilers, by not stating either that the Taj el-'Aroos was mainly derived 
in the first instance from the Lisan el-'Arab (which I believe to have been the case) or that the contents of the former 
are mainly found in the latter. This circumstance has induced me very often to compose articles of my lexicon 
principally from the Lisan el-'Arab in preference to the Taj el-'Aroos, comparing the contents afterwards with the 
latter ; and when they agreed, giving the latter as my authority in most instances (though not alwayst) because I

could only undertake to have the latter transcribed. The only copy of the Lisan el-'Arab known to me is that which I 
have already mentioned. It was lent to me, in successive portions, from the library of the collegiate mosque called 
“the Ashrafeeyeh,” in Cairo. It is written in several different hands, nearly resembling one another, of a peculiar 
cursive kind, which none can correctly read without studying sufficiently to understand thoroughly; for which 
reason, if I had been able to obtain any copy made from it (for it bears statements of its having been several times 
partially or wholly transcribed some centuries ago) I could not have placed much reliance upon it. Since the time of 
the seyyid Murtada, it has suffered much injury, chiefly from the rotting of the paper; in many places, the whole of 
the written portion of a page having fallen out, the margin only remaining. 

Having fully satisfied myself of the authenticity of the Taj el-'Aroos, as well as of its intrinsic value, my next 
object was to cause a careful transcription of it to be commenced without delay, although, while I remained in Cairo, 
I made use of copies belonging to the libraries of mosques. The following are all the copies of that work, or of 
portions thereof, respecting which I have been able to procure any information.— l. The copy made use of by 'Asim 
Efendee in writing his Turkish Translation of the Kamoos. This belonged, according to his own statement, made to 
me, to Yahya Efendee the Hakeem, who for many years composed the annual Egyptian Almanac published by order 
of the Government. He said that it was in the handwriting of the author, in two very large volumes; which, though 
hardly credible, is not absolutely impossible; for the handwriting of the seyyid Murtada was small and compact: that 
the Grand Vezeer who was in Egypt during the contest between our own forces in that country and the French 
borrowed it of him, and sent it to Constantinople without his permission: and that he had caused many inquiries to 
be made for it there, but never learned any tidings of it.— 2. A copy believed to have been in fourteen folio-volumes, 
in the handwriting of the author. Of this, the last volume and the last but two are in the library of the Riwak of the 
Syrians in the great mosque El-Azhar. The rest of it seems to have been lost. It may be a portion of a copy which the 
author retained for himself. When he died, his family kept his death secret for two days ; after which, the officers of 
the Government Treasury plundered his house of much property, among which, perhaps, was this copy; and if so, it 
may have fallen into different hands ; one person taking a portion ; and another person, another portion.— 3. A copy 
sent by the author as a present to the King of San'a. So I was informed on the authority of a person living in Cairo, 
who asserted that he conveyed it for the author, and who must have attained to manhood some years before the 
author's death. He may perhaps be mistaken as to the work that he conveyed; but this is not probable.— 4. The copy 
in the library of the mosque of Mohammad Bey Abu-dh-Dhahab, before mentioned; said to be in eight thick, full- 
paged folio-volumes;* not in the author's handwriting, but transcribed under his superintendence, and in part, and

was never called in question. * I was informed that the number of its volumes is eight; but I was never

perhaps entirely, revised by him. This copy wants a portion from the commencement of the first main division of the 
lexicon; i. e., of » sA: it also wants some other, smaller, portions. I shall have to say more respecting it in the next 
paragraph.— 5. A portion in the handwriting of the author, in my possession; from the commencement of » jV' sA to 
the words cAdl Aj A Ad, in article d j: supplying more than the main portion that is wanting in the copy of 
Mohammad Bey. It is of a small quarto-size, and ends in the middle of a page.— 6. A copy in the library of the late 
Ibraheem Pasha, transcribed from that of Mohammad Bey, and said to be incorrectly written.— 7 A large folio- 
volume, in my possession, before mentioned, consisting of nearly the whole of the first tenth portion; evidently 
transcribed from the copy of Mohammad Bey, for it wants what is deficient in » vW in the latter copy. 

The copy transcribed for me, which is in twenty-four thick quarto-volumes, is partly from the portion, in the 
handwriting of the author, in the great mosque El- Azhar ; but mainly from the copy of Mohammad Bey ; what is 
wanting in this last, in » AA vW, being copied from the MS. No. 5 in the foregoing list ; and very nearly the whole of 
the other (smaller) portions that are wanting therein being supplied from the principal source, namely, the Lisan el-' 
Arab. It is therefore far superior to the other known copies, in respect of completeness, except the first and third of 
the copies mentioned in the next preceding paragraph if these exist and be still entire. But it will not always serve as 
a perfect test of the correctness of my own lexicon, although it has been carefully collated with its originals, as I 
made use of the copy of Mohammad Bey as long as I remained in Egypt, and have used the Lisan el-' Arab and other 
lexicons for the supplying of syllabical signs &c. wanting in that copy and in my own. In my copy, diacritical points 
have often been omitted when not thought by the transcriber to be absolutely necessary; as is the case in almost all 
copies of lexicons: also syllabical signs that are in the originals are not unfrequently omitted : and my copy is more 
irregular than its originals in the manner of writing the letter hemzeh. The copy of Mohammad Bey will probably, in 
a few years, be in many places illegible ; for the ink with which it is written is of a corrosive nature, and has already, 
in those parts, eaten through the paper, though hitherto not to such an extent as to present any difficulty to the 
reader : or rather I should say that such was the case just before my own copy was made ; for while I was translating 
from portions of it already transcribed for me, small pieces often dropped out from its leaves, in spite of my utmost 
care. I believe that if I had not undertaken the composition of the present work, the means of composing such a work 
would not much longer have existed. For not only was the sole copy of the Taj el-'Aroos that was nearly complete, 
and that was worthy of reliance, of those known to exist, rapidly decaying; but many of the most precious of the 
manuscripts from which it was compiled have been mutilated; many are scattered, no one knows whither; and 
several, of which no other copies are known to be in existence, and for which one would have to search from city to 
city, exploring the libraries of mosques, are said to have perished. The transcription of my own copy, and its 
collation, extended over a period of more than thirteen years. It might have been accomplished in much less time, 
had less care been bestowed upon it : but for several years I could find no competent and willing transcriber except 
the sheykh Ibraheem Ed-Dasookee, who was unable to devote the whole of his time to this object. Upon him the task 
of transcription mainly devolved; and the collation was performed wholly by him in conjunction with myself or with 
another sheykh. 

As soon as a few pages of my copy of the Taj el-'Aroos had been transcribed, I commenced the work of 
translation and composition from its originals. I did not hesitate to write my lexicon in English rather than in Latin, 
because the latter language is not sufficiently perspicuous nor sufficiently copious. For several years I continued to 
collect all that I required for a lexicon as complete as it was possible for me to make it. But I then considered that 
about one third of what I had compiled consisted of the explanations of words rarely occurring; many of them, words 
that no one student was likely ever to meet with; and not a few, such as are termed -Ai or -'A or (before 
explained, in page 11. of this preface) ; these last being words known only as having been spoken, each by a single 
Arab, or as only once occurring in any writing. I considered also that the undertaking which I had thus long been 
prosecuting was one which would require many more years for its completion; and that it was incumbent on me to 
take into account the uncertain duration of my appointed term of life, and to occupy myself first with what was most 
important. I therefore finally determined to divide my lexicon into two Hooks: the first to contain all the classical 
words and significations commonly known to the learned among the Arabs: the other, those that are of rare 
occurrence and not commonly known. And I have made such subdivisions as will enable the purchaser of a copy to 
bind it in the manner that he may deem most convenient: in two volumes, or in four, or in eight; each to consist of a 
portion of Book I. with the corresponding portion of Book IL; or so that all the words in Book I. of which the roots 
commence with one letter may be immediately followed by the words in Book II of which the roots commence with 



PREFACE.

the same letter. The Second Book will be small in comparison with the First, of which the Part to be first published (i 
to inclusive) will form about one eighth. In order that it may be possible to bind the whole work in two volumes, I 
have chosen for it a thin paper. 

Nearly twenty years have now elapsed since I commenced this work. Had I foreseen that the whole labour of the 
composition must fall upon me or the project be abandoned, and had I also foreseen the length of time that it would 
require of me, unaided, I should certainly not have had the courage to undertake it, I had hoped that I should have at 
least one coadjutor: and I continued to hope for some years that such might be the case; but by no one have I been 
aided in the least degree, except, occasionally, in discussions of difficult points, by the sheykh Ibraheem Ed- 
Dasookee; who has written the results of some of these discussions on the margins of pages of my copy of the Taj el- 
'Aroos, generally in his own words, but often in words dictated by me. For seven years, in Cairo, I prosecuted my task 
on each of the work-days of the week, after an early breakfast, until within an hour of midnight, with few and short 
intervals of rest, (often with no interruption but that of a few minutes at a time for a meal, and half an hour for 
exercise,) except on rare occasions when I was stopped by illness, and once when I devoted three days to a last visit 
to the Pyramids : I seldom allowed myself to receive a visiter except on Friday, the Sabbath and leisure-day of the 
Muslims : and more than once I passed a quarter of a year without going out of my house. But I must not be 
supposed to claim much credit for the exercise of self-denial with respect to the pleasures of society; for during those 
seven years passed in Cairo, I had my wife and sister and the latter's two sons residing with me, Nor would I here 
make mention of the severe labour which this work has cost me but for the purpose of guarding against the 
imputation of my having been wanting in energy or industry. To convey a due idea of the difficulties of my task 
would be impossible. While mainly composing from the Taj el-'Aroos, I have often had before me, or by my side, 
eight or ten other lexicons, (presenting three different arrangements of the roots, and all of them differing in the 
order, or rather disorder, of the words explained,) requiring to be consulted at the same time. And frequently more 
than a day's study has been necessary to enable me thoroughly to understand a single passage: for the strict rules of 
Arabic lexicology demand that every explanation be given as nearly as possible in the words in which some person of 
authority has transmitted it; and many explanations perfectly intelligible when they were first given became less and 
less so in succeeding ages, and at length quite unintelligible to the most learned of living Arabs. Even Ibn-Seedeh 
often confesses, in the Mohkam, his inability to understand an explanation or some other statement that he has 
transmitted. Many explanations, moreover, present instances of what is termed jAAi; and instances of a worse kind 
of license, termed are not of unfrequent occurrence: by the former term is meant a deficiency in what an 
author writes relying upon the understanding of the reader,” and by the latter term, a deficiency in what he writes 
without relying upon the reader's knowledge. Often, two synonymous words are used to explain each other. 
Numerous cases of this kind occur in the Kamoos: such, for instance, are Ai and jj and AjIj, Ail and -Ail ; 

and and and in these cases I have not always found the information that I required by referring to other 
lexicons. More frequently, in lieu of an explanation, we find merely the word A meaning “well known:” and in a 
very large proportion of such cases, what was once “well known” has long ceased to be so. Still more frequently, 
significations are only indicated by the context: in many instances, as clearly as they could be expressed by any 
words of explanation: but in many other instances, very obscurely. Many words are rendered by others which are not 
elsewhere explained in the same lexicon; many, by words meant to be understood in senses not elsewhere explained 
in that lexicon; many, by words meant to be understood in tropical senses; and many, by words meant to be 
understood in post-classical senses. In these last cases, I have often found in my knowledge of modern Arabic a 
solution of a difficulty: but without great caution, such knowledge would frequently have misled me, in consequence 
of the changes which have taken place in the applications of many words since the classical age. Great caution is 
likewise requisite in the attempt to elicit the significations of words by means of analogy; as I could easily show by 
giving all the principal words of one article with their significations, and then requiring any student to divine the 
significations of the other words of the same article by such means, and comparing his explanations with those that 
have been authoritatively transmitted. Perfect reliance is not to be placed upon vowel-signs and the like when they 
are merely written, without their being either described in words or shown by the statement that the word of which 
the pronunciation is to be fixed is similar to some other word well known. Even when they are described, one has to 
consider what rule the author follows; and in some lexicons the rules followed by the authors are not explained. For 
instance, when a noun of three letters is said to be with fet-h, if in the Kamoos, the meaning is that it is of the 
measure (A: but in some other lexicons it means that it is of the measure If we find such a noun in-the Kamoos

written as of the measure 3*j and said to be with fet-h, we must infer that 3*s (not 3*a) is the correct measure: and if 
in the same lexicon we find such a noun that is to be explained written otherwise than as of the measure 3*^, without 
its being followed by any indication of its measure, we must infer that 3*j is probably its true measure, unless it be a 
word commonly known. But these and other technical difficulties are comparatively small, or become so after a little 
time spent in the study of different lexicons with a previous knowledge of the principles of Arabic lexicology and 
lexicography. Among the graver difficulties are those which are often presented by verses cited as confirmatory 
examples, or as illustrations, without either context or explanation; many of which I have inserted in my lexicon as 
being either absolutely necessary or such as I could not omit with entire satisfaction. Various other obstacles that I 
have had to encounter I refrain from mentioning, hoping that I shall be deemed to have said enough to excuse 
myself for the length of time that has elapsed since the commencement of my work. I have, however, been unusually 
favoured by circumstances; and especially by my having acquired, in familiar intercourse with Arabs, an 
acquaintance with their manners and customs, and their mental idiosyncrasies, indispensably requisite to success in 
my undertaking. Encouraged by these circumstances, I applied myself to the working of the rich mine that I had 
discovered, with the resolution expressed in the saying of a poet,* 

* ! 3uvi us jf 3-VAuA * 

When I had prosecuted my task in Cairo during a period of nearly six years, I understood it to be the desire of 
my Patron that the British Government might be induced to recognise the importance of my work by contributing to 
the expense of its composition. I therefore submitted to the Head of Her Majesty's Government a request that my 
undertaking might be thus honoured and promoted: and I did so in a time peculiarly auspicious; the Premier being 
Lord John Russell, now Earl Russell. His Lordship graciously and promptly replied to my appeal by granting me an 
annual allowance from the Fund for Special Service ; and through his recommendation, this was continued to me by 
one of his successors in office, another Nobleman who added eminence in letters to elevation of birth and station, 
the late Earl of Aberdeen. And here I must especially and gratefully acknowledge my obligations to the learned 
Canon Cureton, for his friendly offices on these and other occasions. I must also add that Professor Lepsius and Dr. 
Abeken, and the late Baron Bunsen, kindly exerted themselves to obtain permission for my lexicon to be printed at 
Berlin, at the joint expense of the Prussian Government and the Academy of Sciences; and several of the learned 
Orientalists of Germany seconded their endeavours; but conditions were proposed to me to which I could not 
willingly accede. 

After a stay of somewhat more than seven years in Cairo, a considerable portion of which period was spent by 
me in collecting and collating the principal materials from which my lexicon is composed, I returned to England; 
leaving to the sheykh Ibraheem Ed-Dasookee the task of completing the transcription of those materials, a task for 
which he had become fully qualified.

I must now add some explanations necessary to facilitate the use of my lexicon. 

The arrangement that I have adopted is, in its main features, the same as that of Golius: the words being placed 
according to their radical letters; and the roots being arranged according to the order of their letters (commencing 
with the first of those letters) in the usual alphabet. 

Words of three different classes, in which the radical letters are the same, but different in number, I place in the 
same article. The first of these classes consists of words of two radical letters ; as 3 : the second class, of 
reduplicative triliteral- radical words, in which the first and second radical letters are the same as those of the first 
class, and the third the same as the second of that class ; as 0) and <Jj and 3 &c. : and the third class, of reduplicative 
quadriliteral-radical words, in which the first and third radical letters are the same as the first of the first class, and 
the second and fourth the same as the second of that class ; as 33 and and <3% &c. These three classes are 
included in the same article in all the best Arabic lexicons; and two reasons may be given for my following the same 
plan. One reason is similarity of signification. Words of the first and second corresponding classes very seldom 
exhibit an alliance in signification; but instances of such alliance in words of the first and third classes are less rare; 
and instances of alliance in signification in words of the second and third classes are very numerous. The other 
reason is, that such words are generally held to be derived from the same root. Some of the Arabian lexicologists 
hold that a word of the class of 3is a biliteral-radical word ; so that the letters of its root are represented by 43 : but 
most of them regard it as, absolutely, a triliteral-radical word ; so that the letters of its root are represented by J*i. 
With respect to a word such as 33, the opinion held by El-Farra and others, and ascribed to El-Khaleel, is, that it is 
to be represented by <3i; so that the letters of its root are represented by ,3 another opinions ascribed to El-Khaleel 
and his followers among the Basrees and Koofees, is, that it is to be represented by 33a; so that the letters of its root 
are represented by 3*i ; another, ascribed to Seebaweyh and his companions, is, that it is originally a word to be 
represented by <_&, and that the third radical letter is changed, and made the same as the first; so that the letters of 
its root are represented by the same letters as if the word itself were to be represented by 33i : the opinion 
commonly obtaining among the Basrees is, that it is to be represented by 33 so that the letters of its root are 
represented, in this case also, by 3*i; and as the last of these modes of representing the word is the one most usual, I 
generally adopt this mode in my lexicon, except in quoting from an author who uses another mode. The triliteral 
root, in both of these classes of words, is that which is preferred in the Muzhir, where, in the 40th Section, not far 
from the commencement, these different opinions are stated. 

Agreeably with the same principle, quasi-quadriliteral-radical words (the conjugations and varieties of which 
will be found in a table inserted in this preface) I class with the triliteral-radical words from which they are derived 
by the Arabian lexicologists and grammarians. 

What is commonly called “the Verb of Wonder” I mention among the verbs. The Koofees say that it is a noun, 
meaning an epithet. (See 33 U ; in article 3-) 

Dialectic variants, synonyms, and words nearly synonymous, from the same root, are mentioned and explained 
in one paragraph: but every word thus explained in a paragraph headed by another word is also mentioned by itself, 
or accompanied by a word or words nearly resembling it in form, with a reference to that paragraph. (In order to 
facilitate the reference, an arrow-head Q) is inserted to render conspicuous a word explained in a paragraph headed 
by another word.) Several obvious advantages result from this arrangement; not the least of which is a considerable 
saving of room. In these cases, when I have found it possible to do so, I have placed the most common word first, or 
otherwise distinguished it from the rest: sometimes I have show n whichwords are more or less common by the 
authorities that I have indicated for them. 

When a noun is not found at the head of a paragraph, or by itself, or with another nearly resembling it in form, 
it is to be looked for among the infinitive nouns, which are mentioned with their respective verbs. And plurals are to 
be found under their singulars.

Words that are regularly formed, ad libitum, (such as active and passive participial nouns, and nouns denoting 
the comparative and superlative degrees, &c.,) are not mentioned, unless for special reasons. 

In respect of the places which I have assigned to arabicized words, I have generally followed the usual practice 
of the Arabian lexicographers; that is, I have generally placed them as though they were derived from Arabic roots; 
because most students look for them under the headings beneath which I have mentioned them, and because many 
of them have derivatives formed from them in the regular Arabic manner. But, properly speaking, every letter in an 
Arabicized word is regarded by most of the Arabian lexicologists as radical. 

When several significations are assigned to one word & c, connected by “or,” it is often the case that one is right 
in one instance, and another in another; and not unfrequently, that all are correct in different instances. 

Whenever I have found it possible to do so, I have distinguished (by the mark t) what is affirmed to be tropical 
from what is proper; generally on the authority of the Asas. I have also generally distinguished (by the mark +) what 
I regard as evidently, or probably, tropical, when I have found no express authority for asserting such to be the case. 
Thus I have often been enabled to draw clearly what may be termed the “genealogies” of significations. Always, in 
the arrangement of significations, I have, to the utmost of my ability, paid attention to their relations, one to 
another. The mark - is used to denote a break in the relations of significations &c.; and = denotes an extraordinary, 
or a complete, dissociation. 

Numerous words in the Sihah and Kamoos and most other Arabic lexicons are merely said to be the names of 
certain plants or animals. Of these I have generally found and given explanations which have either enabled me to 
determine the particular species to which they apply or may enable others to do so, and which will show that the 
applications of many of these words have been changed in post-classical times. For the names and descriptions of 
plants, my chief authority is Aboo-Haneefeh Ed-Deenawaree, who is generally held to have adhered to the original 
nomenclature more accurately than any other writer on the Arabian flora, enabled to do so in many cases by his own 
careful investigations, and by consulting Arabs of the desert, at a sufficiently early period, in the third century of the 
Flight. I have been induced to mention the properties commonly attributed by the Arabs to plants and drugs &c, 
though they are generally fanciful, because they sometimes help to point out what is meant by an explanation 
otherwise vague, and sometimes elucidate far-fetched comparisons or allusions. 

The explanations of the particles are extremely defective in almost all the Arabic lexicons; but of this very 
important class of words, generally more difficult to explain than any other class, I have found, in the Mughnee, 
illustrations even more ample than I required. Though I have generally omitted the statement of opinions evidently 
erroneous, and refuted in the Mughnee, I have in some degree imitated the author of that work by endeavouring to 
treat such words rather too largely than too scantily. 

Of the learning of Golius, and the industry of Freytag, I wish to speak with sincere respect, and with gratitude 
for much benefit derived by me from their works before circumstances gave me advantages which they did not enjoy. 
But lest I should be charged with omitting important matters in some of the originals from which my work is 
composed, it is necessary for me to state that, in countless instances, both of those lexicographers have given 
explanations, more or less full, as from the Sihah or Kamoos or both, when not one word thereof, nor even an 
indication, is found in either of those originals:* and that much of what Freytag has given as from the Kamoos is 
from the Turkish Translation of that lexicon, of which I have before spoken, a work of considerable learning, but of 
no authority when no voucher is mentioned in it.+ I have myself occasionally cited the Turkish Translation of the 
Kamoos, but only when I have not found what I wanted in any other work, and, in a case of this kind, only when I 
have felt confidence in its correctness, or when I have desired a confirmation of my own opinion. In very few 
instances have I adopted its explanations; having often found them to be glaringly incorrect; in some cases, from its 
author's having partially misunderstood what he had to translate ; but in more cases, from his having altogether 
failed to understand, and therefore having given literal renderings which are far from conveying the meanings 
intended.

PREFACE.

Proper names of persons and of places, and post-classical words and significations, I have, with very few 
exceptions, excluded from my lexicon. A dictionary of words of the former class, such as would satisfy the wants of 
students, would of itself alone form a large volume; for the sources from which it might be drawn are abundant, and 
not difficult of access. A dictionary of post-classical Arabic, worthy of being so called, could not be composed 
otherwise than by a considerable number of students in different cities of Europe where good libraries of Arabic 
manuscripts are found, and by as many students in different countries of Asia and Africa; partly from books, and 
partly from information to be acquired only by intercourse with Arabs; and several of those who should contribute to 
its composition would require to be well versed in the sciences of the Muslims. In excluding almost all post-classical 
words and significations, I have followed the example of every one of the most esteemed Arabian lexicographers ; 
and the limits that I have assigned to my labours have certainly been rather too wide than too narrow, as will be 
sufficiently shown by the fact that the quantity of the matter comprised in the first eighth part of my First Book (I to 
inclusive) is treble the quantity of the corresponding portion of Freytag's Lexicon, although I leave rare words &c. 
for my Second Book. 

I have inserted nothing in my lexicon without indicating at least one authority for it, except interwoven 
additions of my own which I have invariably distinguished by enclosing them between square brackets. Throughout 
Part l of the First Book, I have generally made the indications of the authorities as numerous as I conveniently 
could; but I have not thought it desirable to do so throughout, as these indications occupy much space, and what is 
most important is to note the oldest authority mentioned in any of my originals, with one or more of good repute to 
confirm it. A table of the authorities inserted in this preface will show which of them I have cited through the 
medium of the Taj el-'Aroos or the Lisan el-' Arab. Such authorities I have often indicated without any addition.* 
When two or more indications of authorities are given, it is to be understood that they agree essentially, or mainly; 
but not always that they agree in words. When any authority is, in an important degree, less full, or less clear, than 
another or others by which it is accompanied, I distinguish it by an asterisk placed after the initial or initials & c, by 


* By this remark, I may perhaps provoke the retort that, in 
composing an Arabic-English lexicon wholly from Arabic sources, I am 
myself doing what may be resolved into something like reasoning in a 
circle. But such is not the case; for the words employed in explanations in 
the Arabic lexicons are generally still used in the senses in which they are 
there employed; and the intended meanings of words that are not still used 
in such senses are, with few exceptions, easily determined by examples in 
which they occur, or by the general consent of the learned among the Arabs 
in the present day. Of the exceptional difficulties of interpretation, I have 
already said enough; and for my own sake, as well as for the sake of truth, I 
by no means wish to underrate them. 

t In Freytag's first volume, the authorities are seldom indicated. 


Sometimes explanations given by Golius as from the Sihah or 
Kamoos or both, and not found in either of those works, are copied by 
Freytag without his stating such to be the case, and without his indicating 
the authorities or authority assigned by Golius : for example, three such 
instances occur in the short article 

£ In a few instances, in the Taj el-'Aroos, where its author has drawn 
from the Tahdheeb or the Mohkam through the medium of the Lisan el-’ 
Arab, I have found the Tahdheeb erroneously named as his authority 
instead of the Mohkam, or the Mohkam instead of the Tahdheeb. — 
Sometimes an authority is mentioned by a surname borne by two or more, 
so that the person meant is doubtful.

which it is indicated. Frequently it happens that an explanation is essentially the same in the Lisan ab and the Taj el- 
'Aroos, but more full, or more clear, in the former: in cases of this kind I have generally indicated on the latter as my 
authority. 

Sometimes I have been obliged to employ English terms which have not, to my knowledge, been used by any 
other writer; but I have been careful to invent only such as will, I believe, be easily understood. For example, I have 
applied the epithet “heliacal” to certain risings and settings of stars or asterisms, to denote the restriction of those 
risings and settings to the whole period of the morning-twilight: the epithet “heliacal,” applied to such risings, would 
restrict them overmuch. Lexicological and grammatical terms employed in my lexicon will be found in one of the 
tables inserted in this preface. 

I have supposed the student who will make use of this work to be acquainted with the general rules of grammar. 
These he must bear in mind when he meets with particular rules mentioned by me. For instance, from his finding it 
stated, in page 77 of this lexicon, that, when VI is used in the sense of jA, the noun which follows it is put in the same 
case as that which precedes it, he must not imagine that exceptions to this rule are presented by such phrases as V 
■dll VI (There is no deity other than, i. e. but, God) and VI UA I U (This is not anything but a writing) and 6? kU U 
VI oil (No one came but Zeyd) and dA VI li* <>jl (which means the same as the second of these phrases): for in 
each of these examples the noun preceding VI is regarded as being virtually in the same case as the noun following it. 
(See a note in De Sacy's Arabic Grammar, 2nd ed., vol. 2. p. 404.) 

Considering the size of this work, the quantity of Arabic type that it comprises, the minuteness of many of the 
characters employed in it, and the excessive care required in the placing of those small characters, no student can 
reasonably hope to find it entirely free from typographical faults, whether they be such as have originated from the 
compositors and have escaped the scrutiny of the author, or such as are almost inevitable in the process of printing. I 
shall use my utmost endeavours to detect such faults, and to note them for correction. 

The following tables will, I believe, supply all further explanations that will be needed.

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 


I have now, to the best of my ability, supplied all the necessary apparatus for the use of my lexicon, except, only, 
such information as I suppose the student to have acquired from other sources. 

The Arabic title ^ (which the Arabs in general, in the present day, the learned as well as the unlearned, 

would pronounce “Medd el-Kamoos,” as they deem it pedantic to pronounce the titles of books in the classical 
manner,) I have adopted in imitation of that given to his lexicon by El-Feyroozdbadee. It has two meanings: “The 
Flow of the Sea” and “The Extension of the Kamoos.” 

Not only the main expenses incurred in the composition of this work, but also the cost of the printing, and that 
of the Arabic type, have been defrayed by the munificence of His Grace the Duke of Northumberland. The Arabic 
characters have often been considerably altered by the Arabs themselves and by other Easterns; and still more by 
Europeans, to adapt them to the purpose of printing. For this purpose, I have myself innovated a modification of one 
medial form and one final form, and £ and My Nephew, Mr. Edward Stanley Poole, who possesses unusual skill in 
Arabic calligraphy, designed, under my superintendence, the whole of the Arabic type employed for this work; and 
has also assisted me occasionally in the collation of the proofs, previously to my own examination and correction of 
them; and often in other affairs connected with the printing of my lexicon.

A CALAMITY that has recently befallen me, in common with multitudes of other persons, -the decease of the 
ILLUSTRIOUS DUKE by whom this work was originated, and whose munificence has constantly supplied the chief 
means of its support, -requires me to announce that the event so widely and deeply deplored will not cause any 
interruption of the publication. 

His princely patronage, granted spontaneously, and with a kindness and delicacy not to be surpassed, has been 
continued during nearly a quarter of a century. The carrying-out of his intentions, with respect to my Lexicon, now 
devolves upon HIS WIDOW, HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF NORTHUMBERLAND, by her own particular desire. 

The intense interest that has ever been felt by HER GRACE in all the great deeds whereby the departed DUKE has 
established countless claims upon the gratitude of his country is well known; and it is, to me, a source of the utmost 
thankfulness and pride that my own undertaking is included among the objects that have been honoured by the 
patronage, and stamped with the approval, of them both.

POSTSCRIPT TO THE PREFACE. 


Since the publication of the foregoing Preface, two occurrences have induced me to append to it this Postscript, 
without waiting for the completion of my work. 

The first of these occurrences was my receiving the unexpected information that the copy of the 'Obab which I 
had sought, without success, to discover in Cairo had been found and purchased, had been brought to London, and 
was offered to me for sale. A most exorbitant price was demanded of me for it, and refused by me: but my late 
lamented Patron, by means of a person employed to treat for it by my Nephew Mr. Reginald Stuart Poole, bought it, 
for a sum which, though large, was not greater than that which I would myself willingly have paid for it if I had been 
a man of wealth; and most kindly entrusted it to me, for my use during the progress of the printing of my Lexicon. 

The 'Obab is, as I supposed it to be, and as I have since found to be stated by Hajjee Khaleefeh, composed in the 
order of the Sihah, ending in article so that its author completed a little more than three fourths of his intended 
work. To what he has borrowed from the Sihah, which he has freely and literally copied throughout the 'Obab, but 
usually without acknowledgment, he has made large additions, with due acknowledgments, chiefly from the 
Jemharah of Ibn-Dureyd and the Moheet of Ibn-'Abbad. Whether his less numerous additions be from the original 
sources or from citations in other lexicons, I have not been able to determine. Of all the lexicons of earlier authors, 
his work most resembles the Mohkam; which, though it is in my opinion decidedly superior to the 'Obdb in critical 
accuracy and in other respects, he seems to have strangely neglected; thereby suggesting to the author of the 
Kamoos the project of composing the Land', and subsequently the composition of the Kamoos itself.* In a notice of 
its author and of his other works, in article 0*— =, in the Taj el-'Aroos, the 'out, is said to be “ in twenty volumes;” and 
the same is said by Hajjee Khaleefeh : but the copy of it mentioned above is in ten large quarto volumes, written in a 
very large hand, and generally with all the vowel-signs and the like that are absolutely requisite. Several portions of 
it, not, however, amounting to much in proportion to the rest, had been lost when it was brought to England: but as 
the work was never completed, this is less to be regretted than it would be otherwise. In many parts it has been 
injured by worms; and in some parts, by larger vermin. In other respects, it is in good preserva tion. I have often 
found it very useful in the cases of doubtful passages in the Taj el-Aroos; and not unfrequently in its affording me 
valuable additions to the contents of the latter work, though notes in its margins in the hand writing of the Seyyid 
Murtada show that he consulted it with much careful and critical consideration. 

The second reason for my appending here this Postscript to my Preface is to correct the dates of the birth and 
death of El-Azheree. The paragraph relating to his Lexicon, the “ Tahdheeb,” I had inserted in its right relative place 
; but I was afterwards led to transpose it, while the Preface was in type, by observing that the place was inconsistent 
with the dates of his birth and death which I had there given on the authority of two most excellent copies of the 
Muzhir and had repeated in another page ; and I did not discover that these dates were incorrect until it was too late 
to rectify the mistakes otherwise than by reprinting two leaves, after the Preface had been published. El-Azheree, as 
is stated by Ibn-Khillikan, was born in the year of the Blight 282; and died in the latter part of 370, or, as some 


Throughout Part V. of my Lexicon, I have generally endeavoured to show (by the indications of my authorities) the degrees in which the 'Obab has 
borrowed from the contents of the Sihah and contributed to the contents of the Kamoos.

say, 371; 80 that he lived 88 or 80 years (lunar reckoning). In the year 311, being then about 29 years old, be became 
a prisoner among the Karmatees, falling to the lot of a party of Arabs of the Desert. Among these people be appears 
to have remained several years; for he is related to have mentioned his having passed two winters with them in Es- 
Samman; but usually to have wintered with them in the Dahna. And while wandering and sojourning with them in 
these and other parts of Central and Northern Arabia, he collected many words. And phrases, which he has 
mentioned in his Lexicon; but expressly distinguishing them as having been heard by him from the Arabs or from 
Arabs of the Desert (in both cases meaning the same) or as having been heard by him in the Desert, lest he should be 
supposed to claim for them less questionable authority. His opinion of these additions to the “Tahdheeb” is shown 
by his insertion of them, and also by a citation from a statement in his own handwriting, that in the speech of the 
people among whom he was in captivity, themselves Arabs of the Desert, a gross inaccuracy or mistake was seldom 
or never found. Thus we learn a very important fact respecting the gradual corruption of the dialects of Arabic: the 
utmost that can be said of the dialect spoken by the wandering tribes more than nine centuries ago in the North- 
Central region, where the vernacular language has continued to the present day to he least exposed to 
foreign influences and therefore least affected thereby, is, that it was free from gross inaccuracies. That the language 
of the settled inhabitants throughout Arabia had long before become too much corrupted for their words or phrases 
to be cited in lexicons unless for the purpose of discriminating them as post-classical, is admitted and affirmed by all 
the lexicologists who have had occasion to mention the subject: but the language now spoken in the towns of the 
North-Central region (which language is well known by reason of that region's being still traversed by one of the 
great pilgrim-routes and often visited by learned men from Egypt and from Syria) is said to be less corrupt than are 
the dialects of the Bedawees of the same and of other parts. 

More than seventeen hundred printed pages of my Lexicon are now before me; and when it is considered that 
this portion comprises about thrice as much matter as the corresponding portion (one half) of Freytag's unabridged 
Lexicon, I hope that the time which the printing has occupied will not he thought unreasonably long. 
Notwithstanding the time and pains that I have devoted to the scrutiny necessary for the detection and correction of 
typographical and other errors, the errata that I have since casually observed and noted down are not so few as I 
hoped and expected them to be: but I have generally found them to be such as any one qualified to make a profitable 
use of my work may easily discover and rectify without my aid.

\ 


The first letter of the alphabet [according to the 
order in which the letters are now commonly 
disposed; and also according to the 
original order, which see in art. called ‘-ill. 
[This name, like most of the other names of 
Arabic letters, is traceable to the Phoenician 
language, in which it signifies “an ox;” the 
ancient Phoenician form of the letter thus called 
being a rude representation of an ox's head.] It is, 
of all the letters, that which is most frequent in 
speech: and some say that, in fil, in the Kur [ch. 
ii. &c.], it is a name of God. (TA.) Its name 
is properly fem., as is also that of every other 
letter; [and hence its pi. is but it may be 

made masc.: so says Ks: Sb says that all 
the letters of the alphabet are masc. and fem., 
like as u^l is masc. and fem. (M.) As a letter of 
the alphabet, it is abbreviated, [or short, and is 
written I, as it also is generally when occurring in 
a word, except at the end, when, in certain cases, 
it is written ti,] and is pronounced with a pause 
after it: and it is also prolonged: (S, K, * TA:) [in 
the latter case, it is written and] this is the case 
when it is made a subst.: and when it is not called 
a letter, [i. e. when one does not prefix to it the 
word 1 — “!>=>-,] it is [properly] fem. (S.) Its dim. 
is <jjI, meaning an *1 written small, or obscure, (S, 
IB,) according to those who make it fem. and who 
say, Ijlj and YIA ^iLj; but -Syi according 

to those who say, Ijl j (IB.) — '-*]! [properly 

so called] is one of the letters of prolongation and 
of softness and of augmentation; the letters of 
augmentation being ten, which are comprised in 
the saying, p. jyll [“to-day thou wilt forget it”]. 

(S.) There are two species of >—«!'; namely, ^ [or 
soft], and 3-S j [or movent]; the former 
of which is [properly] called and the 

latter, (S, TA;) which is a faucial letter, 

pronounced in the furthest part of the fauces [by 
a sudden emission of the voice after a total 
suppression, so that it resembles in sound a 
feebly-uttered £ whence the form of the 
character (=0 whereby it is represented]: but this 
latter is sometimes tropically called ‘-*11; and both 
[as shown above] are of the letters 
of augmentation. (S in art. jl, and TA.) There are 
also two other species of ‘-*11; namely, S^j ( -*li 


[the alif of conjunction or connexion, or 
the conjunctive or connexive alif]; and ^ ( -*!i 
[the alif of disjunction, or the disjunctive alif]; 
every one that is permanent in the connexion 
of words being of the latter species; and that 
which is not permanent, [i. e. which is not 
pronounced, unless it is an alif of prolongation,] 
of the former species; and this is without 
exception augmentative; [but it is sometimes a 
substitute for a suppressed radical letter, as 
in o)l, originally or jij;] whereas the alif of 
disjunction is sometimes augmentative, as in the 
case of the interrogative alif [to be 
mentioned below, and in other cases]; and 
sometimes radical, as in and I: (S, TA:) or, 
according to Ahmad Ihn-Yahya and Mohammad 
Ibn-Yezeed, (T, TA,) the primary -^'-*1' are three; 
the rest being subordinate to these: namely, — *11 
[radical alif], (T, K, TA,) as in 3*ij and JSI (T) 
and iil; (K;) and —ill [disjunctive alif], as 
in (T, K) and (T) and J— (T, K;) 
and —ill [conjunctive or connexive alif], 

(T, K,) as in (T) and £ jiiil. (T, K.) 

The ^-*11 which is one of the letters of prolongation 
and of softness is called ‘-*MI [the quiescent 
alif, and SiStUl iliftil, which signifies the same]: 
(MF, TA:) it is an aerial letter, (Mughnee, MF, 
TA,) merely a sound of prolongation after a fet- 
hah; (T, TA;) and cannot have a vowel, 
(IB, Mughnee, MF,) wherefore it cannot 
commence a word: (Mughnee:) when they desire 
to make it movent, if it is converted from j or ls, 
they restore it to its original, as in <jlj-=>*- 
and u^j; and if it is not converted from j or lS, 
they substitute for it hemzeh, as in l) 3-“G, in 
which the hemzeh is a substitute for the I in [the 
sing.] (IB.) IJ holds that the name of this 
letter is Y, [pronounced la or le, without, or with, 
imaleh, like the similar names of other letters, 
as ^ and and Ij &c.,] and that it is the letter 
which is mentioned [next] before ls in reckoning 
the letters; the J being prefixed to it because it 
cannot be pronounced at the beginning of its 
name, as other letters can, as, for instance, 
and £; and he adds that the teachers [in schools] 
err in pronouncing its name ^*11 ^Y. (Mughnee.) 
— — The grammarians have other particular 


appellations for alifs, which will be here 
mentioned. (T, TA.) — — iljfrkJI — *&l [The 
unknown alif] is such as that in [or J^la] 
and i. e., every I, (T, K,) of those having 

no original [from which they are converted, not 
being originally I nor j nor ls, but being merely a 
formative letter, and hence, app., 
termed “unknown”], (T,) inserted for the purpose 
of giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah in a verb 
and in a noun; (T, K;) and this, when it 
becomes movent, becomes j, as in the case of 
and fjlji-, becoming j in this case because it is 
movent, and followed by a quiescent I, which I is 

the I of the pi., and is also -d (T.) 

CiliJI [xhe alifs of prolongations] are such as 
those [which are inserted for the same purpose of 
giving fulness of sound to the fet-hah] in 
for and for and ij^l- 3 , for jjIA. (T, 
K.) In like manner, j is inserted after a dammeh, 
as in j_>l=jl; and ls after a kesreh, as in 3^*“. (TA.) 
An alif of this species is also called £4A,YI ( -*]i [The 
alif added to give fulness of sound to a fet-hah 
preceding it]: and so is the alif in Ii* used in 
imitation [of a noun in the accus. case; as when 
one says, (pronounced ^ j ) “I saw a 

man,” and the person to whom these words are 

addressed says, Whom?]. (Mughnee.) 3*11 

fl-^l [The alif of annexation, or the annexed alif,] 
is that which is an annex to the fet-hah of a 
rhyme, (T, K,) and to that of the fem. 
pronoun 1*: in the former case as in 
ULajl tyi=, j in which I is made an annex to 
the fet-hah of the £ [of the rhyme]; and in the 
saying in the Kur [xxxiii. to], ^ j^l in 

which the I after the last u is an annex to the fet- 
hah of that u; and in other instances in the final 
words of verses of the Kur-an, as j}J j* and 
[in lxxvi. 15 and 18]: in the other case as in 
and (T.) The difference between it 

and Ji-ajll i$ ; that the latter is in 

the beginnings of nouns and verbs, and the 
former is in the endings of nouns [and verbs]. (T, 
K.) It is also called [The alif of 

unbinding, because the vowel ending a rhyme 
prevents its being i. e. “bound” by the 
preceding consonant]: (Mughnee;) and 3*11 

[the alif of the final word of a verse of poetry or of

a verse of the Kur-an or of a clause of rhyming 
prose]. (TA.) [This last appellation must not 
be confounded with that which here next 

follows.] yLalill iliWI [The separating alif] is 

the I which is written after the j of the pi. to make 
a separation between that j and what follows it, 
as in I j (x, K) and I j 3*4 and in the like of bj*) 
and I j^4 [and l y-^y]; hut when a pronoun is 
affixed to the verb, this I, being needless, does not 
remain: (T:) also the I which makes a separation 
between the u which is a sign of the fern, gender 
and the heavy [or doubled] u [in the 
corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], 
(T, K,) because a triple combination of u is 
disliked, (T,) as in [ji-iii and and] o4M (T, 

K) and V. (T.) SjjiAll jjlll 4ili [The alif 

of the light, or single, noon in the contracted 
corroborated form of the aor. and imperative], as 
in the phrase in the Kur [xcvi. 15], UiU 
■4“=411 j [explained in art. j^-], (T, K,) and the 
phrase [in xii. 32], u jjctLJI j* tjjijlj [And he 
shall assuredly be of those in a state of vileness, 
or ignominy], in both of which instances the 
pause is made with I [only, without tenween, so 
that one says 1*441 and 4 j^jl, and this seems to be 
indicated in Expositions of the Kur-an as the 
proper pronunciation of these two words in the 
phrases here cited, the former of which, and 
the first word of the latter, I find thus written in 
an excellent copy of the Mughnee, with a fet-hah 
only instead of tenween, though I find 
them written in copies of the Kur-an and of the K 
with tenween, and for this reason only I have 
written them therewith in the first places 
above], this I being a substitute for the light u, 
which is originally the heavy J: and among 
examples of the same is the saying of El- 
Aasha, I44.li Aill j Ojjiill [And praise not 

thou the opulent, but God do thou praise], the 
poet meaning u-^'A but pausing with an I; (T:) 
and accord, to 'Ikrimeh Ed-Dabbee, in the saying 
of Imra-el-Keys, J 3“j 3 4 o* 44 ^ [what 

is meant is, Do thou pause that we may weep 
by reason of the remembrance of an object of 
love, and of a place of abode, for] the poet 
means u4, but substitutes I for the light u; (TA;) 
or, accord, to some, is in this case [a dual] 
addressed to the poet's two companions. (EM p. 

4.) 441 [The alif of exchange] is that 

which is substituted for the tenween (T, K) of the 
accus. case when one pauses upon it, (T,) as 
in 143 ^40 (T, K [and so in the copy of the 
Mughnee mentioned above, but in the copies of 
the T I find l4j,]) and 134- and the like. (T.) 

4ali [The alif of inability to express 

what one desires to say], (T,) or ^441 l -4i [the alif 
of feigning negligence or heedlessness], (K,) [but 


the former is evidently, in my opinion, the right 
appellation,] is that which is added when one 
says 3 ic - u!, and then, being unable to finish his 
saying, pauses, saying 13*° ul [in the CK 13“°,] 
prolonging it, desiring to be helped to the speech 
that should reveal itself to him, (T, K,) and 
at length saying 34*4, meaning to say, if he were 
not unable to express it, 34*4 jie jl [Verily 
'Omar is going away]. (T.) The I in a case of this 
kind is [also] said to be j£4ll [for the purpose of 
endeavouring to remember]; and in like 
manner, j, when one desires to say, 43 f j4, and, 
forgetting 4u, prolongs the sound in 
endeavouring to remember, and says y 34. 
(Mughnee in the sections on I and j.) It is also 
added to a curtailed proper name of a person 
called to, or hailed, as in ^ 4 for 3*° 4 [which is 
an ex. contrary to rule, as y^- is masc. and 

consists of only three letters]. (T.) -4411 341

Zeyd!], (T, K,) i. e. the I after the J; (T;) and one

pausation. (Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Malik, and I 'Ak p. 

272.) jls4l4VI 3ili [The alif of disapproval], 

(T,) or liilVl [which means the 

same], (Mughnee,) is similar to that next 
preceding, as in 113^ [What! Aboo- 'Omar?] 
in reply to one who says, “Aboo-'Omar came;” 
the » being added in this case after the letter of 
prolongation like as it is in »4l>ls Ij said in 
lamentation. (T.) [The ex. given in the Mughnee 
is »I3^ l as said in reply to one who says, “I met 
’Amr;” and thus I find it written, with i; but this is 
a mistranscription of the interrogative ', which 
see below.] In this case it is only added to give 
fulness of sound to the vowel; for you say, » 343 1 
[What! the man? for 4443b] after one has said 
“The man stood;” and »i>4.31l in the accus. case; 
and in the gen. case. (Mughnee in the

pi. number, jP P [Say ye]; but not when the verb is 
connected with a word following it: and they say 
also V, with a hemzeh, [for V,] in a case 
of pausation. (T.) But Ahmad Ibn-Yahya says, All 


men say that when a hemzeh occurs at the end of 
a word, [i. e. in a case of pausation,] and has 
a quiescent letter before it, it is elided in the nom. 
and gen. case, though retained in the accus. case 
[because followed by a quiescent I], except Ks 
alone, who retains it in all cases: when it occurs 
in the middle of a word, all agree that it should 
not be dropped. (T.) AZ [however] says that the 
people of El-Hijaz, and Hudheyl, and the 
people of Mekkeh and ElMedeeneh, do not 
pronounce hemzeh [at all]: and 'Eesa Ibn-’Omar 
says, Temeem pronounce hemzeh, and the 
people of El-Hijaz, in cases of necessity, [in 

poetry,] do so. (T.) Ks cites, [as exhibiting

3=Llj JjLLIj [And the God of thy

Thou art, in my estimation, one deserving of its 
being said to him, Mayest thou have no father! it 
is used in the manner of a proverb, is of frequent 
occurrence in poetry, (M,) is said to him who has 
a father and to him who has not a father, and is 
an imprecation as to the meaning, of necessity, 
though enunciative as to the letter; (M, K;) and 
hence the saying of Jereer, til V ff pi 4 [o 
Teym, Teym of 'Ades, may ye have no father!]; 
which is the strongest evidence of its being a 
proverb, and not having a literal meaning; for all 
of [the tribe of] Teym could not have one father, 
but all of them were fit objects of imprecation 
and rough speech: (M:) it is an expression 
of praise: (S:) [i. e.] it is an imprecation against 
him to whom it is addressed, not, however, said 
with the desire of its having effect, but on an 
occasion of intense love, like Lll ^1 V, &c.: (Har p. 
165:) and sometimes in dispraise, like Lll £1 V: and 
in wonder, like LSjj P: (TA:) or, as A Heyth says, 
on the authority of Aboo-Sa'eed Ed- Dareer, 
it expresses the utmost degree of reviling; 
[meaning Thou hast no known father;] and fl V 
expresses reviling also, but means Thou hast 
no free, or ingenuous, mother: (Meyd in Har p. 
165: [see £':]) sometimes it means Strive, or exert 
thyself, in thine affair; for he who has a 
father relies upon him in some circumstances of 
his case: (TA:) accord, to Kh, it means Thou hast 
none to stand thee in stead of thyself: (ISh, TA:) 
Fr says that it is a phrase used by the Arabs 
[parenthetically, i.e.,] to divide their speech: 


(TA:) [thus, for instance,] Zufar Ibn-El- 
Harith says, V m jkll lS j LSI 4! V ^ji 

4-L4 VI Jlijj [Show thou me my weapons: (mayest 
thou have no father! or thou hast no father: 
& c.:) verily I see the war, or battle, increases not 
save in perseverance]. (TA.) [Aboo-'Alee, as cited 
in the M, observes that the I (meaning the final I) 
in LI, in the phrase LSI LI V, indicates that it is a 
prefixed noun, and determinate; whereas the J 
in LSI together with the government exercised 
upon the noun by V indicates that it is, on the 
contrary, indeterminate, and separate from what 
follows it: but it seems that he was unacquainted 
with the dial. var. LI; for LSI Li V in the dial, of him 
who uses the form Li instead of 4->l is the same 
grammatically as LSI C_il V in the dial, of him who 
uses the form P.] Suleyman Ibn-'Abd-El-Melik 
heard an Arab of the desert, in a year of drought, 
say, LI! LI V pill Lile J jjl, and Suleyman put the 
best construction upon it, [as though it meant, 
Send down upon us rain: Thou hast no father], 
and said, I testify that He hath no father nor 
female companion nor offspring. (TA.) They say 
also, in paying honour [to a person], LlLLil p V, 
and Lliilil p V, (TA,) i. e. May thy hater have no 
father! or, accord, to ISk, each is a metonymical 

expression for LSI LI V. (S in art. 'LL, q. v .) 

One also says, on the occasion of an occurrence 
that is approved and commended, by way of 
expressing wonder and praise, Li p <11, 
meaning To God, purely, is attributable [the 
excellence of] thy father, seeing that he begat 
thee a generous son, and produced the like of 
thee! (TA;) [or to God be attributed (the 
excellence of) thy father!] it means that to God 
[alone] belongs the power to create the like of 
this man [to whom it relates], from whom has 
proceeded this wonderful action. (Har p. 44.) — 
— And 4P p iJ js,, meaning She resembles her 
father in strength of mind, or spirit, and 
sharpness of disposition, and in hastening, 
or striving to be first, to do things: said of Hafsah, 

by 'Aisheh. (TA.) ulj, (TA,) or diil ^4, (T in 

art. 4,) [said to a person,] means [^4 PP Mayest 
thou be ransomed with my father! (see the 
next sentence but one;) or] ^4 Lip [1 wifi 
ransom thee with my father]; (T ubi supra;) 
or p4 l sp> 4jjl Thou art, or shalt be, ransomed 
with my father]; or p4 Llip [1 have in my heart 
ransomed thee, or I would ransom thee, with my 
father]; the m being dependent upon a 
word suppressed, which, accord, to some, is a 
[pass, participial] noun, and accord, to others, a 
verb; and this word is suppressed because of 
the frequent usage of the phrase. (TA.) You say 
also, P j Cui p [With my father mayest thou 


be ransomed, and with my mother!]. (TA.) 
And p isii, i. e. Lp P p4 P [May he 
whom I love be ransomed with my father!], 
meaning may he [my father] be made a ransom 
for him [whom I love]! (El-Wahidee on the 
Deewan of El-Mutanebbee, in De Sacy's 
Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed. vol. iii. p. 35 of the Arabic 
text.) Sometimes they change the lS into ': a poet 
says, 44 lj ji jk. J* j Upc eke Jk pi Ipk j jSj 
L» [And they have asserted that I have become 
impatient on account of them two: but is it an 
evidence of impatience that I said, Alas, with my

L>* p4. (S.) And some of the Arabs used to say, I j 
llI 44 [Alas, with my father mayest thou be 
ransomed!]: this, says AM, being like 41) j L for 4 
pfo; as also LL 4, with the hemzeh changed 
into l s, originally 44 4, meaning p44 : and hence 
what is related, in a trad., of Umm- 'Ateeyeh; that 
she used not to mention the Prophet without 
saying, 44 [for > p]. (TA in art. 4.) A woman 
said, 4441 j j* 4 j Lki 4 [O thou to whom I 
would say, With my father mayest thou be 
ransomed! and O thou who art above him to 
whom I would address the saying, With my father 
mayest thou be ransomed!]; respecting which Fr 
observes that the two words [4-“ and P] are made 
as one [by prefixing the article] because of their 
frequent occurrence; (S;) and Aboo-'Alee says 
that the lS in p is substituted for «, not 
necessarily; but ISk quotes the words 
as commencing with 44 4, which is the right 
reading, in order that this expression may agree 
with LLull ) which is derived from it: 
EtTebreezee, however, relates Abu-l-'Ala's 
reciting the words as ending with Pp; saying 
that this is compounded from the phrase p4, and 
that therefore the * is preserved. (TA.) [See also 

the first paragraph in art. 4.] You say also, 4 

441 [meaning O my father], (S, M, K,) as in 4 
cl*il pi [o my father, do thou such a thing]; (S;) 
and Cui 4; (S, M, K;) and pi4; (Z in the Ksh xii. 
4;) and “LI 4 (S, M, K) when you pause after it. (S, 
M.) The », [here written p] (Kh, M,) the sign of 
the fem. gender, (S, Z,) is substituted for the 
[pronominal] affix lS, (Kh, S, M, Z,) as in pp; 
(S;) and is like the » in and as is shown 
by your saying, in pausing, 'Ll 4, like as you say, 4 
LSA : (Kh, M:) the annexing of the fem. cii to a 
masc. noun in this case is allowable, like as it is 
in 3^>Uk. and jSi sli and Lj j 34 j and Li 
its being made a substitute for the affix lS is 
allowable because each of these is an 
augmentative added at the end of a noun: and the 
kesreh is the same that is in the phrase 4: (Z 
ubi supra:) the does not fall from mI in the

phrase 44' 4 when there is no pause after it, 
though it [sometimes] does from in the like 
phrase in that case, because the former word, 
being of [only] two letters, is as though it 
were defective. (S.) ^4' 4 is for 4? 4, (Aboo- 
'Othman El-Mazinee, S, * M, [the latter 
expression mentioned also in the K, but not as 
being the original of the former,]) the I [and “] 
being suppressed; (the same Aboo- 'Othman and 
M;) or for 4)' 4, the I being suppressed, like 
as the lS is in pX 4; or it may be after the manner 
of ^4. (Z ubi supra.) 4 is thus pronounced 
after the usual manner of a noun ending with the 
fern. », without regard to the fact that the cii is in 
the former a substitute for the suffix <j. (Z ubi 
supra.) 4)1 4 is said in a case of pause, except in 
the Kur-an, in which, in this case, you say, 4)1 4, 
following the written text; and some of the Arabs 
pronounce the fem. », in a case of pause, [in 
other instances], thus saying, cjiJia U. (s.) »4' 1) is 
also said; (M, K;) though scarcely ever. (M.)

license, in a case of necessity in verse. (TA.)

signifying “a place in which women assemble,”

Yezeed, pL* is from pi, aor. pi.] — I. q. j 3 a [The

small in the £ ja [or vagina]: (M:) or it has these 
two contr. significations. (K.) is a quasi-inf. n. 
of pi in the last of the senses explained above. 
(Msb.) [Thus it signifies A staying, remaining, 
dwelling, or abiding, in a place. But it more 
commonly signifies] The assembling of women 
[and of men also] in a case of rejoicing and of 

mourning. (Har p. 234.) It is also a noun of 

time from the same. (Msb.) [Thus it signifies A 
time of staying or remaining, &c.] And it is 


also a noun of place from the same. (Msb.) [And 
thus it signifies A place of staying or remaining, 
&c. But it more commonly signifies] A place 
of assembling of women [and of men also] in a 
case of rejoicing and of mourning: from pi, 

aor. pi, accord, to Khalid Ibn-Yezeed. (T.) 

And hence, tropically, (Msb,) (tropical:) 
Women assembling together (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, 
K) in a case of rejoicing and of mourning, (T, M, 
Mgh, K,) or in a case of good and of evil: (S, 
Msb:) or any assembly, (M, K,) of men and of 
women, (M,) in a case of mourning or of 
rejoicing: (M, K:) or particularly of young 
women; (M, K,) accord, to some; but it is not so: 
and some assert that the word is derived from pi, 
in the first of the senses explained in this art.; 
and from pP, as an epithet applied to a woman; 
because it signifies women coming together, and 
meeting face to face, in a case of good and of evil: 
(M:) the pi. is p^. (S, Mgh.) Abu- 1 - Ata Es-Sindee

IAmb. (Mgh.) But accord, to IB, nothing forbids 
that it may occur in the sense of A place

wailing, and weeping; for therefore do women 
assemble: and thus it may be in the saying of Et-

what is intentional and what is unintentional: 
(Kull:) or [so accord, to the M, but in the K “

import than 3 j^: (TA:) 1 £33 [which is originally 
an inf. n. of £31] is syn. with £3J; (T, * Mgh;) and so, 

too, is 1 £131, (Msb,) or j £13], signifying a deed 
retarding recompense: (TA:) the pi. of £3]

say Kh and Sb: (T:) or punishment (Yoo, Lth, T, 
M, K) thereof: (Lth, T, M:) and j £13] and 1 ££

[xxv. 68], 1*131 [He shall find a requital, or 
recompense, or a punishment, of sin]: (T, S, M:) 
in my opinion, [says ISd,] the correct meaning is, 
he shall find the punishment of £31 [ 0 r sins]: but 
some say, the meaning is that which here follows. 

(M.) A valley in Hell. (M, K.) £13J: see £3J: —

seeking or demanding to that which is 
without prohibition: and it is said by some that it 
does not occur after an interrogation: 
(Mughnee:) Er-Radee says, in the Expos, of the 
Kafiyeh, after Z and others, that it is to denote 
acknowledgment of the truth of information, and 
does not occur after a saying in which is the 
meaning of seeking, or demanding: (TA:) or, 
accord, to Z and Ibn-Malik and others, it relates 
particularly to information: and accord, to Ibn- 
Kharoof, it occurs mostly after information: 
(Mughnee:) in the Expos, of the Tes-heel, it is 
said to be for denoting acknowledgment of the 
truth of information, past or other, affirmative or 
negative, and not to occur after an interrogation: 
(TA:) Akh says that it is better than 
(S, Mughnee, K *) after information, (Mughnee,) 
in acknowledging the truth of what is said; (S, 
Mughnee, K;) and ^ is better than it after 
an interrogation: (S, Mughnee, K:) so that when 
one says, Mili [Thou wilt, or shalt, go away], 
thou sayest 31' [Yes]; and it is better than f": but 
when one says, [wilt thou go away?], thou 
sayest f*j; and it is better than 31. (S.) 31' The 
term, or period, of a thing: (S, K:) its assigned, 
appointed, or specified, term or period: this is

pi. 3!'. (Msb, K.) — — Hence, The period 
of women's waiting, before they may marry 
again, after divorce: as in the Kur ii. 231 and 232 .

26 Digitized Text Version VI. 1 


[BOOKI.] 


God has eternally decreed the end of life hy 
slaughter or otherwise: or, as some say, the 
whole duration of life: and its end: a man's life 
being thus termed: and his death, by which it 
terminates: (Kull p. 17:) the assigned, or 
appointed, duration of the life of a man. (TA.) 
One says, ^43 '==, meaning His death drew near; 
originally, =li==LI the completion of the 

duration of life. (TA.) In the Kur vi. 128, (see 2, 
above,) the meaning is, The term of death: or, as 
some say, the term of extreme old age: (TA:) 
or the day of resurrection. (Bd, * Jel.) The words 
of the Kur [vi. 2] 3=3 j p mean 

[Then He decreed a term,] the term of death, and 
[there is a term named with Him,] the term of 
the resurrection: or the period between the 
creation and death, and the period between death 
and the resurrection; for 33 is applied to the 
end of a space of time and to the whole thereof: 
(Bd:) or the meaning is, the period of sleep, and 
the period of death: (Bd, TA:) or the period 
of those who have passed away, and the period of 
those who remain and those who are to come: 
(Bd:) or the period of remaining in this world, 
and the period of remaining in the world to 
come: or in both instances death is meant; 
[accidental, and natural;] for the 3=3 of some is 
hy accidental means, as the sword, and drowning, 
and burning, and eating what disagrees, and 
other means of destruction; while some have 
their full periods granted to them and are 
preserved in health until they die a natural death: 
or the 3=3 of some is that of him who dies in a 
state of happiness and enjoyment; and of others, 
that of him who reaches a limit beyond which 
God has no? appointed, in the natural course of 
this world, any one to remain therein; and to 
both of these, reference is made in the Kur [xvi. 

72 and] xxii. 5. (TA.) Sometimes, also, it 

means Destruction: and thus it has been 
explained as occurring in the Kur [vii. 184], 
where it is said, f3=3 Mj=a I jS jj£j jl jlj 
[And that, may be, their destruction shall have 
drawn near]. (TA.) 33: see 33. 33: see 33. 3=3

present; future; to come; contr. of 333 (S, Msb,

see what here next follows, to AA He (a man, 
S) was, or became, alone, by himself, apart 
from others, or solitary; syn. ajajl; (S, K;) as also

dial, of El-Yemen. (L.) -A, originally A}, the j 
being changed into I, (Msb,) One; the first of the 
numbers; (S;) syn. [in many cases] with A}; (S, 
Msb, K;) with which it is interchangeable in two 
cases, to be explained below: (Msb:) pi. A.I 
and uA (K) and ujAI, which last occurs in 
a phrase hereafter to be mentioned; (TA;) or it 
has no pi. in this sense; (Msb, K, * TA;) and as 
to A, it may be pi. of Aj, [and originally AjIJ 
like as pi. of (Th, Msb,) a pi. of pauc. 
(Msb.) The fem. is [ lsAI only; and this is only 
used in particular cases, to be shown below: 
(Msb:) most agree that the lS in this word is 
the characteristic of the fem. gender: but some 
say that it is to render it quasi-coordinate to the 
quadriliteral-radical class: [this, however, 

is inconsistent with its pronunciation, which is 


invariably <_sAI ; not i_sAl : ] (TA:) its pi. is A| ; as 
though the sing, were »AI ; like as is said of as 
pi. of <j 3A one of the expositors of the Tes-heel 
writes it A, with damm and then fet-h; but a pi. 
of this measure is not applicable to a sing, of the 
measure with kesr. (MF.) The dim. of Ai is 
J, AA; and that of lsAI is J, lS-AA. (L in art. j.) — 
— It is interchangeable with A j in two cases: 
first, when it is used as an epithet applied to God: 
(Msb:) for AVI, as an epithet, is applied to God 
alone, (Msb, K,) and signifies The One; the Sole; 
He who has ever been one and alone: or the 
Indivisible: or He who has no second [to share] 
in his lordship, nor in his essence, nor in his 
attributes: (TA:) you say, Ajll j* and AVI >: 
and in like manner, A. without the article, is 
used as an epithet specially in relation to God, 
and is interchangeable in this case [but not in 
other cases] with Aj: therefore you do not 
say -A 34 j nor -A' jj and the like [but 34 j 
Ay and A j f* j) &c.] (Msb.) [See also Ay ; in 
art. j.] In the phrase in the Kur [cxii. l], > 33 
Ai -kill [Say, He is God, One God], -Ad is 
a substitute for <111; for an indeterminate noun is 
sometimes a substitute for a determinate noun, 
as in another passage in the Kur, xcvi. 15 and 16. 
(S.) Secondly, it is interchangeable with Ay in 
certain nouns of number: (Msb:) you say jA. A 
[masc.] and jAI [fem.] (S) 

[meaning Eleven: and in these two cases you may 
not substitute Ay and »A j for AI and <_sAl : km] 
in ujjAc jAI [One and twenty, and the like,] Ai 
is interchangeable with -A j. (Msb.) Ks says, 
When you prefix the article 31 to a number, prefix 
it to every number; therefore you should 
say, jAl AaiVl jAll Av I Cilia U [What did the 
eleven thousand dirhems?]: but the Basrees 
prefix it to the first only, and say, jAc. AVI U 

e* j? A ill. (s.) In [most] cases differing from 

these two, there is a difference in usage 
between -Ad and Ay : the former is used 
in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, 
governing the noun which follows it in the gen. 
case; [as in exs. which will be found below;] 
and is used absolutely in negative phrases; [as 
will also be seen in exs. below;] whereas Aly is 
used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed 
noun and otherwise: the fem. lsAI, also, is only 
used as a prefixed noun, except in numbers 
(Msb) [and in one other instance, which see 
below]. Using -Ad and its fem. in affirmative 
phrases as prefixed nouns, you say, -Ad 43 
[One of the three stood]; and A*, lAl All [One 
of them two (females) said]; and ^Al A 
[Take thou one of the three]. (TA.) The 
phrase Ai ^Al means A calamity: (K:) or, 


as some say, (TA, but in the K “ and,”) a serpent; 
(K, TA;) so called because it twists itself round so 
as to become like a ij>A. (TA.) And 
the phrase AVI lS^A, (L, K, TA,) in which the 
latter word has kesr to the ! and fet-h to the £, 
and is pi. of the former, also written AVI, but this 
form is disapproved by MF, as has been shown 
above, (TA, [in several copies of the K incorrectly 
written AVI,]) [lit. means One of the ones; and] is 
applied to a great, or mighty, event; (L, K, TA;) 
one that is difficult, distressing, grievous, or 
terrible. (L, TA.) You say, AVI csAL [the last 
of which words is here again written in 
several copies of the K AVI] He brought to pass a 
grievous, and great, or mighty, event, (K, TA,) 
when you desire to express the greatness 
and terribleness of an event. (TA.) You also 
say, utA'VI AI yili, and u;A‘VI Aj, (k, TA,) the 
latter in one copy of the K written jjA jll A j, in 
which the latter word is pi. of the former, (TA,) 
and -AVI Ay, and AVI ,_sAl, (k, TA,) like a 
phrase before mentioned, only the former 
is applied to a calamity, and this to an intelligent 
being, and written in the two manners before 
mentioned, the difference being only 
in application, (TA, [in several copies of the K 
here again written AVI cjAl, and in the CK 3AI 
AYl,]) and OjAYi i_sAl, (Et-Tes-heel,) and i_sAI 
-AVI, (TA,) which are expressions of the utmost 
praise, (IAar, A Heyth, K,) [lit. Such a man is one 
of the ones; meaning] such a one is unique 
among the uniques; (TA;) one who has no equal; 
unequalled; incomparable. (IAar, Tes-heel.) It 
seems that the form of pi. used in the phrase Ai 
3bAVI j s used only as applied to rational beings; 
but it is said in the Expositions of the Tes-heel 
that this phrase signifies One of the calamities; 
the form of the rational pi. being given to 
nouns significant of things deemed great, mighty, 
or grievous. (AHeyth.) In the phrase AVI ^Al, 
the fem. forms are said to be used for the 
purpose of giving intensiveness to the 
signification, as though the meaning were 4* 13 
the word <A^ being [an intensive epithet] 
from 4U j as signifying intelligence, or intelligence 
mixed with craft or cunning and forecast; or 
by <A J being meant a calamity. (Expositions of 
the Fs, TA.) AHei thought ujAYi AI to be an 
epithet applied to a male, and -AY I ^Al to be 
applied to a female: but his opinion has been 
refuted by EdDemameenee in the Expos, of the 
Tes-heel: and this latter author there remarks, 
that in expressions meant to denote praise [of a 
man], Ai and csAl are prefixed to their own 
proper pis., as ujAI and AI; or to an epithet, as 
in the case of f Alill A [One of the learned]; but

nouns. (TA.) You say likewise, t»lil| jjl ji He is

(L in art. ^ j.) One instance is mentioned, of 

the occurrence, in a trad., of not used as a 
part of a number [i. e. not as a part of the 
compound ^ikl] nor as a prefixed noun; 
viz., [One of seven]; in which ^ is 

said to mean the nights of 'Ad [during which that 
tribe was destroyed], or the years of Joseph 
[during which Egypt was afflicted with dearth]. 
(MF, from the Faik &c.) — — Used in a negative 
phrase, signifies Any one with whom one may 
talk or speak: and in this manner it is 
used without variation as sing, and pi. and fern. 
(S) as well as masc. (Msb.) You say, J 3 l ^ i=J v i 
[There is not any one in the house]: but you 
do not say, Jkl t$ji [as meaning the contrary]. (S.) 
We read in the Kur [lxix. 47, this ex. of its use as a 
masc. pi.], Oijf-'-k kie ji.i qa Us [And not any 
persons of you should have withheld me 
from punishing him]. (S.) And in the same 
[xxxiii. 32, we find this ex. of its use as a fem. 
pi ], jLuill -kik [Ye are not like any 
others of women]. (S.) — — It is also used in 
interrogative phrases; as in the saying, l?I j 3 * 
JU [Has any one seen the like of 
this?]; (A'Obeyd, L;) and in the saying, liij iu k 
[for ■iki Ik, O, has any one seen her, or it?]. (L, 

from a trad.) It is [said to be] also used in 

the sense of [meaning Anything], applied to 
an irrational being; as in the saying, 0? Jk! k U 
IjUi. VI Ji.i There is not in the house anything, 
rational or irrational, except an ass: so that the 
thing excepted is united in kind to that from

rendering; but this instance is generally regarded 
as one in which the thing excepted is disunited in 
kind from that from which the exception is 
made]. (Msb.) So too in the Kur lx. 11, accord, to 
the reading of Ibn-Mes'ood: (Msb:) but others 
there read which may mean any one or any 

thing. (Bd, Jel.) kkSb, (K,) as also JkVI fji, 

(S, Msb,) as a proper name, (Msb,) is applied to A 
certain day; (K;) [Sunday;] the first day of the 
week; or, as some say, [i. e. as some term it,] the 
second of the week; (TA;) for the Arabs are said, 
by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath, or 
Saturday, as the first, though they called Sunday 
the first of the days: (Msb in art. £*=>•:) it is sing.,

K) and u 1 ^: (K:) or it has no pi. (K: [but in the 
TA this last observation is very properly 
restricted, as relating only to -U as syn. with -Uj,

sense, it has no dim. (Sb, in S, art. o-U.) — — 
AkVI in lexicology signifies What have

if the cj were to denote the fem. gender, the

the comparative and superlative degrees,

up, or surrender, the thing committed to his trust 
and care] (T, S, M, K) [than thou], (S,) or o* 
?j3 [than another than he]. (M, * K.) [Az says,] 
the vulgar say, jj3; but this is incorrect, and 
not allowable; and I have not known any one of 
the grammarians allow l s 3, because J*3 denoting 
wonder [and the comparative and 
superlative degrees] is not formed but from the 
triliteral [verb], and one does not say, lS^ in the 
sense of lS^: the proper phrase is 33 ,>31. (T.) — 
See also art. j3. : see art. j3. 3 3 a word 

denoting past time: (Lth, T, S, M, L, Mughnee, 
K:) it is a noun, (S, L, Mughnee, K,) indecl., with 
its last letter quiescent; and properly is prefixed 
to a proposition; (S, L, K;) as in Jjj j-a 3 3 ii 3 [I 
came to thee when Zeyd stood], and jjj 3 
and fjh -ij 3 [When Zeyd was standing]. (S, L.) 
The proposition to which it is prefixed is either 
nominal, as in [the words of the Kur viii. 
26 ,] JJs £ul it I j jSil j [And remember ye when ye 
were few]; or verbal, having the verb in the pret. 
as to the letter and as to the meaning, as in [the 
Kur ii. 28 , &c„] 4” j J^ 3 j [And when thy 

Lord said unto the angels]; or verbal with 
the verb in the pret. as to the meaning but not as 
to the letter, as in [the Kur ii. 121 ,] fa* >] ji 3 j 
jcljall [And when Abraham was rearing 
the foundations]; all three of which kinds are 
comprised in the Kur where it is said, [ix. 40 ,] HI 
lAA 3 >jjl >jlj lj>& >31 -3 ij AJll As 0 

JiA “dll tj] 03^ Y A > .. .3 , i] jUtll [If ye will 

not aid him, verily God aided him, when those 
who disbelieved expelled him, being the second 
of two, when they two were in the cave, when he 
was saying to his companion, Grieve not thou, for 
God is with us]. (Mughnee.) But sometimes one 
half of the proposition is suppressed, as in dlli ij, 
[also written 3113,] meaning 31Si£ 311 j 3 [when that 
was so], or 311 j 3 [when that was, i. e. then, at 
that time]. (Mughnee.) And sometimes the whole 
of the proposition is suppressed, (M, Mughnee,) 
as being known, (Mughnee,) and tenween is 


substituted for it; the j receiving kesreh because 
of the occurrence of two quiescent 
letters together, (M, Mughnee,) namely the j and 
the tenween, (M,) and thus one says, 3uj 4 ; the 
kesreh of the j not being, as Akh holds it to be, 
the kesreh of declension, although 3 here 
occupies the place of a noun governed in the gen. 
case by another prefixed to it, (M, Mughnee,) 
for it still requires a proposition to be understood 
after it, (Mughnee,) and is held to be indecl. (M, 
Mughnee) by general consent, like and iy>, (M,) 
as being composed of two letters. (Mughnee.) [J 
says,] when 3 i s not prefixed to a proposition, it 
has tenween: (S:) and hence Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, 
(S, M,) y 3 clijij <2 Uj 3 I 3L3Ja >• ■ • 

[I forbade thy suing Umm-'Amr in health, thou 
being then sound]; (S, M, L, Mughnee, TA; [but 
in two copies of the S, for I find JjsUj; and in 
the L it is without any point;]) in which [J says] 
the poet means like as one says 3lij \ 

and 333; (S:) and Fr says that some of the Arabs 
say, Isf * ■ -! 135 j liS Jl£, meaning 311 j 3 3 * 

[Such and such things were, he being then a boy]. 
(T.) lS)] also occurs for 3 [app. 3, but whether this 
or 3 is not clear in the MS. from which I take 
this]. (M.) When 3 j s adjoined to nouns 
signifying times, the Arabs join it therewith in 
writing, in certain instances: namely 33^ [At that 
time, or then], and 3 a ji [In, or on, or at, that 
day], and 333 [in, or on, or at, that night], 
and 33 Ai [i n , or on, that morning], and 3n3e [in, 
or on, that evening], and 33U> [in that hour: or 
at that time; then], and 34c. [in that year], 
[and 32 j At that time; then]; but they did not 
say 33h, because ijYl denotes the nearest present 
time, except in the dial, of Hudheyl, in which it 
has been found to occur. (T.) When it is followed 
by a verb, or by a noun not having the article JI 
prefixed to it, or [rather] by any movent letter, 
the j of 3 is quieseent; but when it is followed by 
a noun with JI, [or by any I,] the j is mejroorah, 
as in the saying, J3 jli I j jail 3 [when 

the people, or company of men, were alighting, 

or taking up their abode, at Kadhimeh]. (T.) 

In general, (Mughnee, K,) it is an adverbial noun 
denoting past time, (M, Mughnee, K,) when it is a 
noun denoting such time, (Mughnee, K,) as in 3 j 
■*33311 31 j J12 [explained above], (M,) and in 3a 
I j j3 >31 3 <111 [also explained above, 

and in other instances already mentioned]: 
(Mughnee, K:) in the former of which instances, 
AO says that it is redundant; (M, Mughnee;) but 
Aboo-Is-hak says that this is a bold assertion of 
his; (M;) [and IHsh says,] this assertion is of no 
account, and so is that of him who says that it 
here denotes certainty, like A (Mughnee:) 


[J holds the opinion of AO on this point; for he 
says,] 3 is sometimes redundant, like 13, as in the 
saying in the Kur [ii. 48 ], 1)333 3j, 

meaning ur- j* 33333 [And We appointed a time 
with Moses; but instances of this kind are most 
probably elliptical: see the next sentence]. (S.) As 
a noun denoting past time, it is [said to be] also 
an objective complement of a verb, as in [the Kur 
vii. 84 ,] jiS 3 I j>3 3 [And remember ye 
when ye were few]: (Mughnee, K:) and generally 
in the commencements of narratives in the Kur, 
it may be an objective complement of j£3 
understood, as in 3Tj Jla 3 3 

[before cited], and the like. (Mughnee: but see 
the third of the sentences here following.) As 
such, it is [said to be] also a substitute for 
the objective complement of a verb, as in [the 
Kur xix. 16 ,] c 33 uil 3 yJSJI ^ jS3 j [And 
mention thou, or remember thou, in 

the Scripture, Mary, the time when she withdrew 
aside], where 3 is a substitute of implication 
for fj>. (Mughnee, K: but see the second of the 
sentences here following.) As such, it also has 
prefixed to it a noun of time, of such a kind that it 
is without need thereof, as in 3«3 1 , or not of such 
a kind that it is without need thereof, as in 
[the Kur iii. 6 ,] 323 3 ,3j [After the time when 
Thou hast directed us aright]. (Mughnee, K.) And 
it is generally asserted, that it never occurs 
otherwise than as an adverbial noun, or as having 
a noun prefixed to it; that in the like of 3 I j j£3 j 
33a it is an adverbial noun relating to an 
objective complement suppressed, i. e. I jj£3 j 
jJlS 3 e <111 <A*j [And remember ye the 
grace of God towards you when ye were few]; and 
in the like of c 33 i:l 3 ; that it is an adverbial 
noun relating to a suppressed prefixed noun to 
[that which becomes by the suppression] the 
objective complement of a verb, i. e. [in 
this instance] j; j-« j£3 j [And mention thou, 

or remember thou, the case of Mary]: and this 
assertion is strengthened by the express mention 
of the [proper] objective complement in [the Kur 
iii. 98 ,] 33 1 .-3 3 aS3c. <111 <Axi Ijj23 3 [And 
remember ye the grace of God towards you when 
ye were enemies]. (Mughnee.) — — Also, 
(Mughnee, K,) accord, to some, (T, Mughnee,) it 
is used (T, Mughnee, K) as a noun (Mughnee, K) 
to indicate future time, (T, Mughnee, K,) and 13 is 
said to denote past time, (T,) [i. e.] each of these 
occurs in the place of the other; (TA;) the former 
being used to indicate future time in the Kur 
[xxxiv. 50 ], where it is said, lj=- ja 3 <s J 1 j^j [And 
couldst thou see the time when they shall be 
terrified], meaning the day of resurrection; this 
usage being allowable, says Fr, only because the

[BOOKI.] 


proposition is like one expressing a positive fact, 
since there is no doubt of the coming of that day; 
(T;) and in [the Kur xcix. 4,] A jlA .1 A.Aj iiijj [On 
that day, she (the earth) shall tell her tidings]; 
(Mughnee, K;) this being generally regarded as 
similar to the expression of a future event 
which must necessarily happen as though it had 
already happened; but it may he urged in favour 
of those who hold a different opinion that it is 
said in the Kur [xl. 72 and 73], jj u^Aj 

(ji J 5 AVI [They shall hereafter know, when 
the collars shall he on their necks]; for u>Aj is a 
future as to the letter and the meaning because of 
its having conjoined with it, and it 

governs it, which is therefore in the place of Aj. 

(Mughnee.) It also indicates a cause, as in 

[the Kur xliii. 38,] fAli. il £jjll fiiA jl [It will not 
profit you this day, since, or because, ye have 
acted wrongfully], (Mughnee, K,) i. e. because 
of your having acted wrongfully in the sublunary 
state of existence; (Bd, Mughnee;) but it is 
disputed whether it be in this instance a 
particle in the place of the causative J, or an 
adverbial noun: (Mughnee:) Aboo-'Alee seems to 
hold that fAlA il [as meaning when ye have 
acted wrongfully] is a substitute for, or a kind of 
repetition of, fjJI; an event happening in the 
present world being spoken of as though 
it happened in the world to come because the 
latter immediately follows the former. (IJ, M, L, 
Mughnee.) You say also, -A. 4 AAI [Praise 
be to God because, or that, thou earnest, or hast 
come]. (S in art. 4 ?-.) — — It is also used to 
denote one's experiencing the occurrence of 
a thing when he is in a particular state; (S, L;) or 
to denote a thing's happening suddenly, or 
unexpectedly; (S, Mughnee, K;) like lit; (S;) 
and in this case is only followed by a verb 
expressing an event as a positive fact, (S, L,) and 
occurs after lA and AA; (Mughnee, K;) as [in exs. 
voce u 4 ; and] in 4 j AA ij I A lit AA [While I was 
thus, or in this state, lo, or behold, or there, or 
then, at that time, (accord, to different 
authorities, as will be seen below,) Zeyd 
came]; (S, L;) and as in the saying of a poet, jAAj 
uuAA CjjIji j : » 'i 1 As j 'dll [Beg 

thou God to appoint for thee good, and do thou 
be content therewith; for while there has been 
difficulty, lo, easy circumstances have come 
about]: (Mughnee, K: *) but it is 

disputed whether it be [in this case] an adverbial 
noun of place, (Mughnee, K,) as Zj and AHei 
hold; (TA;) or of time, (Mughnee, K,) as Mbr 
holds; (TA;) or a particle denoting the sudden, or 
unexpected, occurrence of a thing, (Mughnee, K,) 
as IB and Ibn-Malik hold; (TA;) or a 
corroborative, i. e. [grammatically] redundant, 


particle, (Mughnee, K,) an opinion which Ibn- 
Ya'eesh holds, and to which Er-Radee inclines. 
(TA.) — — It is also a conditional particle, but 
only used as such coupled with G>, (S, 

L, Mughnee, *) and causes two aorists to assume 
the mejzoom form, (Mughnee,) as when you 
say, Ail [When, or whenever, thou shalt 

come to me, I will come to thee], like as you 
say, ^IjI uj [If thou come to me at some, 

or any, time, I will come to thee]; and you say 
also Ail Ail [like as you say, Ail uj, using the 
pret. in the sense of the future]: (S, L:) it is a 
particle accord, to Sb, used in the manner of the 
conditional uj; but it is an adverbial noun accord, 
to Mbr and Ibn-Es-Sarraj and El-Farisee. 

(Mughnee.) [What I have translated from 

the S, L, K, and TA, in this art., is mostly 
from » >*11 of Jill sA : the rest, from s-A 
4JLUI <_ilVI.] lit lil denotes a thing's happening 
suddenly, or unexpectedly; (Mughnee, K;) or 
one's experiencing the occurrence of a thing 
when he is in a particular state; (S;) like ij: (S 
voce ij:) it pertains only to nominal phrases; does 
not require to be followed by a reply, or the 
complement of a condition; does not occur at the 
commencement of a sentence; and signifies 
the present time, (Mughnee, K,) not the future; 
(Mughnee;) as in AiA 4 «VI lila AAji. [1 went 
forth, and lo, or behold, or there, or then, at 
that present time, (accord, to different 
authorities, as will be seen below,) the lion was at 
the door]; and (in the saying in the Kur [xx. 21], 
TA,) <A ur* IA [And lo, or behold, &c., it was 
a serpent running]; (Mughnee, K;) and in the 
saying, fils 4 j lila cAfyk, which means I 
went forth, and Zeyd presented himself to me 
suddenly, or unexpectedly, at the time, by 
standing. (S, TA.) Accord, to Akh, it is a 
particle, (Mughnee, K,) and his opinion is 
rendered preferable by their saying, uj lij® aA yi. 
A 44 ' 4 j [I went forth, and lo, or behold, verily 
Zeyd was at the door]; for ['i' cannot here be a 
noun governed in the accus. case, as] what 
follows uj, which is with kesr, does not govern 
what precedes it: (Mughnee:) accord, to Mbr, it is 
an adverbial noun of place: accord, to Zj, an 
adverbial noun of time. (Mughnee, K.) Ibn- 
Malik adopts the first of these opinions; Ibn- 
'Osfoor, the second; (Mughnee;) and so El- 
Fenjedeehee; (TA;) and Z, the third; and he 
asserts that its governing word is a verb 
understood, derived from slAUill; [agreeably with 
the explanation cited above from the S;] but 
others hold that the word which governs it in the 
accus. case is the enunciative, which is either 
expressed, as in JJA 4 j I A aA>. [I went forth, 
and there, in that place, or then, at that time. 


Zeyd was sitting], or meant to be understood, as 
in aAVI lils ; i. e. >a A [And there, or then, the 
lion was present]; or if it be supposed to be 
[itself] the enunciative, its governing word 
is jialA or >Al [understood]: and in the last of 
the phrases here mentioned, it may be an 
enunciative accord, to the opinion of Mbr, the 
meaning being AVI sjUalAl^a [And among the 
things present was the lion]; but not accord, to 
the opinion of Zj, because a noun signifying time 
cannot be the enunciative of one signifying a 
corporeal thing; nor accord to the opinion of Akh, 
because a particle cannot be used to denote the 
enunciative of such a thing; or, as signifying 
time, it may be the enunciative of such a thing if 
we suppose a prefixed noun to be suppressed, the 
meaning of AVI lila being AVI lila 

[And then was the presence of the lion]. 
(Mughnee.) You may say either uAA 4 j I A cAji. 
or AiA [1 went forth, and lo, or behold, &c., Zeyd 
was sitting or Zeyd was there sitting], with the 
nom. as an enunciative and with the accus. as a 
denotative of state. (Mughnee.) The Arabs 
said j* I A j^ijyll AA1 util j Ai I J , " A ta 

u* [I used to think that the scorpion was more 
vehement in stinging than the hornet, and lo, 
he is (as vehement as) she], and also, AU jk lila, 
which Sb disallowed, in contending with Ks, who 
allowed it, and appealed for confirmation thereof 
to certain Arabs, whose judgment was 
pronounced in his favour; but it is said that they 
were bribed to give this judgment, or that 
they knew the place which Ks held in the 
estimation of Er-Rasheed; and if the latter 
expression be of established authority, it is 

irregular and unchaste. (Mughnee.) It also 

denotes the complement of a condition, like —4 
(S, Msb,) with which it is in this case syn., 
(Msb,) as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 35], uj j 
u jAA (A lij 4AI Aiia Uj <iAi [And if an evil 

befall them for that which their hands have sent 
before, (i. e. for sins which they have committed,) 

then they despair]. (S, Msb.) It is also an 

adverbial noun denoting future time, (S, Msb, 
Mughnee, K, *) and implying the meaning of a 
condition, (Msb, Mughnee,) and this is generally 
the case when it is not used in the manner first 
explained above. (Mughnee.) In this case it is not 
used otherwise than as prefixed to a proposition, 
(S, Mughnee,) which is always verbal, as in the 
words of the Kur [xxx. 24], u* lij p 

uj 4 jAi £ijl lij u^jVI [Then, when He shall call 
you, or when He calleth you, (for, as in Arabic, so 
in English, a verb which is properly present is

forth], in which occur both the usages of lil here

mentioned; (Mughnee;) and in the phrase, li) 
ok [when thou shalt come, I will treat 
thee with honour]; (Msb;) and in the 
phrase, >4!l>4l lij 4)41 [i will come to thee 
when the fullgrown unripe dates shall become 
red], and 4 [when such a one shall 

arrive], which shows it to be a noun because this 
is equivalent to fa [on the day when such 

a one shall arrive]: (S:) or in the phrase >41 li) fa 
>411 [and in many other cases] it denotes time 
divested of any accessory idea, the meaning being 
[Arise thou] at the time of the full-grown unripe 
dates' becoming red: and so in the saying of 
EshShafi'ee, If a man were to say, 4 >4 

! il > or jd ,jii, [Thou art divorced when I 
do not divorce thee,] and then be silent for a time 
sufficient for the divorce to be pronounced 
therein, she would be divorced; but should he 
make it dependent upon a thing in the future, the 
divorce would be delayed to that time, as if he 
said, >4! >4 tit [using it in the sense 
first assigned to this phrase above]. (Msb.) The 
verb after it is in most cases a pret.: in other 
cases, an aor.: both occur in the saying of Aboo- 
Dhu-eyb, J4 4! 44 j til Ajfclj j 

[And the soul is desirous when thou makest it 
desirous; and when thou reducest it, or restrictest 
it, to little, it is content]. (Mughnee.) When it 
is immediately followed by a noun, as in [the 
phrase in the Kur lxxxiv. l,] ciiil £UU1 tit, the 
noun is an agent with a verb suppressed, 
explained by what follows it; contr. to the opinion 
of Akh; (Mughnee;) the complete phrase being lj] 
CiLiil iliUl cAiil [when the heaven shall be cleft, 
(when) it shall be cleft]; and in like manner, uj, as 
in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6], Of 4.1 j\ 3 
j4>"4 (I 'Akp. 123.) And in the saying 
of the poet, ^j.41 Oli Os lg.4 jJj Aj 4 >Uv,-. *cikj Off 1) lij 
i!4 is meant to be understood after I- 1 [so that the 
meaning is, When a Bahilee (a man of the tribe of 
Bahileh) has, or shall have, as his wife a 
Handhaleeyeh (a woman of the tribe of 
Handhaleh, who were renowned for generosity), 
he having offspring from her, that (offspring) is, 
or will be, the mail-clad]. (Mughnee.) — — 
Sometimes it denotes past time, (Mughnee, K,) 
like as A) sometimes denotes future 
time, (Mughnee,) as in [the saying in the Kur lxii. 
11,] 44j I >4jl I jl sjlkj I jl j tit 3 [And when they 

saw merchandise or sport, they dispersed 
themselves to it]. (Mughnee, K.) [Thus] it occurs 
in the place of A), like as jj occurs in the place 

of 4. (TA.) And sometimes it denotes the 

present time; and this is after an oath, as in [the 
phrase in the Kur xcii. 1,] >4) 4 J4llj [By the 
night when it covereth with its darkness]. 


(Mughnee, K.) It also occurs in the sense of 

the conditional uj, as in the saying, 4 j£l 
meaning uj [I will treat thee with 

honour if thou treat me with honour]: (T:) [for] 
what is possible is made dependent upon it as 
well as what is known to be certain, as in the 
phrases, 4 j 44 4 [If Zeyd come] and >1 j 44 
>41 [When the beginning of the month 
shall come]; or, accord, to Th, there is a 
difference between lij and uj; (Msb;) the latter 
being held by him to denote what is possible, and 
the former to denote what is ascertained; so that 
one says, 4j 0! and >-41 >0 *4 lij. (Msb in 
art. jl.) — — When a verb in the first person 
sing, of the pret. is explained by another verb 
after it immediately preceded by l!j£] ,'ij is 
understood before the former verb, and 
therefore] the latter verb must be in the second 
pers. sing., as in 44 ^ lij <41 [meaning 
Thou sayest (of a thing) <41 when, or if, thou hast 
turned it about in thy mouth]. (MF in art. jr jl. See 
also is'; last sentence but one.) — — It is 
sometimes redundant, like as 4 is sometimes 
[accord, to some], as in the saying of 'Abd-Menaf 
Ibn-Riba El-Hudhalee, iii siUa ^ jilLi lij ^-1=.. 

lijlill AJU4JI jjlu US [Until they made them to 
pass along Kirii (here meaning a 
certain mountain-road so named, S in art. UaJ 
urging on, like as the owners, or attendants, of 
camels drive those that take fright and run away]; 
for it is the end of the poem: or he may have 
abstained from mentioning the enunciative 
because of its being known to the hearer. (S.) 
When 14 is preceded by 4=“-, [as in this instance,] 
it is generally held that lil is not governed by 
in the gen. case, but is still an adverbial noun, 4=- 
being an inceptive particle without government. 

(Mughnee.) As to what it is that governs 4j 

in the accus. case, there are two opinions; that it 
is its conditional proposition; or a verb, or 
the like, in the complement thereof: (Mughnee, 
K:) the former is the opinion of the critical 
judges; so that it is in the predicament of ^4 

and 1-44 and jU, (Mughnee.) Sometimes it 

is used so as not to denote a condition, as in the 
words of the Kur [xlii. 35 ], uj>4 <4 I fi^t. U lij j 
[And when, or whenever, they are angry, they 
forgive], in which it is an adverbial noun relating 
to the enunciative of the inchoative after it; for if 
it denoted a condition, and the 
nominal proposition were a complement, it 
would be connected by and the same is the 
case when it is used after an oath, as in an ex. 
given above. (Mughnee.) — — See also what 
follows, lij, (Msb, TA, the latter as on the 
authority of Lth,) with tenween, (TA,) or u4j, (T, 


S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K, the first as on the 
authority of Lth,) written in the former manner, 
(TA,) or in the latter, (T,) when connected with a 
following proposition, (T, TA,) and in a case of 
pause written J, lij, (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K, 
TA,) and therefore the Basrees hold that in other 
cases it should be written lij, (Msb,) though El- 
Ma- zinee and Mbr hold that it should be in this 
case also with u, while Fr holds that it should 
be written with I; when it governs, and otherwise 
with u, in order to distinguish between it and [the 
adverbial noun] lij: (Mughnee:) a particle, (S, 
Msb, Mughnee, TA,) accord, to the general 
opinion; and accord, to this opinion, it is a simple 
word, not compounded of 4! and O'; and as being 
simple, it is that which renders an aor. mansoob, 
not o' suppressed and meant to be understood 
after it: some say that it is a noun: (Mughnee:) 
[but a knowledge of its meaning is necessary to 
the understanding of the reason given for 
asserting it to be a noun.] It denotes a response, 
or reply, corroborating a condition; (Lth, T, 
TA;) or compensation, or the complement of a 
condition; (Msb;) or a response, or reply, (Sb, S, 
Mughnee, K,) in every instance; (TA;) 
and compensation, or the complement of a 
condition, (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K,) though not 
always: (Mughnee, TA:) and its virtual meaning 
is [Then; i. e., in that case; or] if the case, or 
affair, be as thou hast mentioned, (M, K, TA,) or 
as has happened: (M, TA:) [and hence,] accord, 
to those who say that it is a noun, the original 
form of the phrase 4Ii j£i jj] [Then, or in that 
case, or if the case be so, I will treat thee 
with honour, said in reply to one who says “ I will 
come to thee,”] is 4ii j£i 4% l^j [When thou shalt 
come to me, I will treat thee with honour]; then 
the proposition [^>4] is thrown out, and 
tenween [or u] is substituted for it, (Mughnee,) 
for which reason, and to distinguish between it 
and [the adverbial] u, the Koofees hold that it 
should be written with lij, (Msb,) and jl 
[preceded by (4 >4 or the like] is suppressed 
and meant to be understood [as that which 
renders the aor. mansoob; so that when one 
says 4ii j£l jij, it is as though he said ^44 lij 
When thou shalt come to me, it will be 
incumbent, or obligatory, on me to treat thee 
with honour]. (Mughnee.) It renders an 
aor. following it mansoob on certain conditions: 
(Mughnee, TA:) to have this effect, the aor. must 
have a future signification, (T, S, Mughnee, 
TA,) not present: (TA:) 41i j£i ji must 

commence the phrase in which the aor. occurs; 
(Mughnee, TA;) [or, in other words,] the aor. 
must not be syntactically dependent upon what

[BOOKI.] 


precedes bl; (TA:) and there must be nothing 
intervening between lit and the aor., (T, 
Mughnee, TA,) unless it is a particle, (T,) or an 
oath, (T, Mughnee,) or the negative Y: 
(Mughnee:) therefore, to a person who says, “To- 
night I will visit thee,” (S,) or who says, “I will 
come to thee,” (Mughnee,) you say, bli jSI jit 
[Then, or in that case, &c., I will treat thee with 
honour]; (T, S, Mughnee;) and to one who says, 
“I will treat thee with honour,” you say, tit 
[Then, or if the case he so, I will come to thee]. 
(TA.) When the verb after Cpl has the present 
signification, it does not govern: (S, Mughnee, 
TA:) therefore, to a person who says, “I 
love thee,” you say, >42=1 cpj [Then, or if the case 
be so, I think thee veracious]; for this is a mere 
reply: (Mughnee:) and to one talking to thee, bl 
UjlS dlki [Then I think thee to he lying]. (TA.) 
When it is put in a middle place, (S,) not 
commencing the phrase, (Mughnee,) the verb 
after it not being syntactically dependent upon 
what is before it, (S, TA,) it does not govern: (S, 
Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to one who says, "I will 
come to thee,” (Mughnee, TA,) you say, CP 1 ! bi 
blijSl [I, in that case, will treat thee with honour]: 
(S, Mughnee, TA:) for Cpl among the words which 
govern verbs is likened to i>=ll among those 
which govern nouns: (S:) and when it is put at 
the end, it does not govern; as when you 
say, >4ip jSI [I will treat thee with honour in that 
case]. (S.) The saying [of the poet, or rajiz], Y 
Ijjhil jl *211*1 bl Ijjki (^jSjSis explained by 
regarding it as an instance of the suppression 
of the enunciative of u], so that the meaning 
is, bib Jc. jjal Y and then a new phrase 
commences [wherefore the verse means Do not 
thou leave me among them remote, or a stranger: 
verily I cannot endure that: in that case I should 
perish, or I should flee]. (Mughnee.) When it 
is immediately preceded by a conjunction such 
as j or ( -i, the aor. may he either marfooa or 
mansoob. (S, Mughnee.) When a noun is 
introduced between it and the aor., the latter is 
marfooa, (T, Mughnee,) as in the saying, Pi ji.i cp! 
Pbj£j [Then, or in that case, thy brother will 
treat thee with honour], (T,) or Plijii <111 Ac U til 
[Then, or in that case, O ‘Abd-Allah, I will treat 
thee with honour]; hut Ihn-’Osfoor allows 
the intervention of an adverbial noun [without 
annulling the government]; and Ibn-Babshadh, 
that of the vocative, and of a prayer; and Ks 
and Hisham, that of a word governed by the verb; 
hut Ks in this case prefers nash; and Hisham, 
refa. (Mughnee.) When you put an oath in the 
place of the noun, you make the aor. mansoob, as 
in the saying, <UI y bl [Then, or if the case be 
so, by God, thou wilt sleep]: but if you prefix J to 


the verb with the oath, you make the aor. 
marfooa, saying, f**bl <Ulj cpl [Then, or if the 
case be so, by God, assuredly thou wilt regret, or 
repent]. (T.) When you introduce a particle 
between it and the aor., you make the latter 
either marfooa or mansoob, saying, PiijSI V jil 
and PlijSI Y [Then, or in that case, I will not treat 

thee with honour]. (T.) Sometimes the I is 

rejected, and they say, Y CP [Then, (a word 
exactly agreeing with CP in sound as well as 
in meaning,) or in that case, I will not do such a 
thing]. (M, K, * TA.) — — IJ relates, on the

injuring another: (Er-Raghib:) but Es-Semeen

[BOOKI.] 


so says the author of the K, following AHeyth: hut 
it is no corruption, for it is mentioned by 
the authors on verbs and by ISd and others; (MF, 
TA;) for instance, by AHn, in his book on plants, 
and by IF, in the Mj: (TA:) [and J mentions it 
in its proper place, in art. ^ j, as well as in the 
present art.:] | ^jl, with the j musheddedeh, 
has also been found in the handwriting of certain 
of the men of letters; but this is a corruption. 
(K.) !=>ji A colour like that of the ji [or jl]. 
(Sgh, K.) J=jt, (Mbr, S, K,) of the measure 
because you say JajjU [explained below,] 
(Mbr, S,) the alif (Mbr, S, K) ending it (Mbr) 
[written ls] being a letter of quasi-coordination, 
(S, K,) not to denote the fern, gender, (Mbr, S,) 
its n. un. being »LLjl, (Mbr, S, K,) wherefore it is 
with tenween when indeterminate, but not when 
determinate: (S, K:) or it is of the measure 3*ii, 
(Mbr, * S,) the last letter being radical, (Mbr,) 
because you say j* (Mbr, S,) and in this 
case it should be mentioned among words with 
an infirm letter [for the last radical], and is with 
tenween both when determinate and when 
indeterminate; (S;) [but this is a mistake, for 
when it is determinate, it can be with tenween 
only if used as a proper name; therefore,] IB 
observes, that if you make its last letter radical, 
its measure is J*il, and a word of this measure, if 
a subst., is imperfectly decl. when determinate, 
but perfectly decl. when indeterminate: (TA:) 
[the author of the K copies the error of the 
S, saying, “or its alif is radical,” (meaning its last 
letter,) “ and in this case it is always with 
tenween; ” and he adds, “or,” (for which 
he should have said “ and,”) its measure is J*ai: to 
all which it is necessary to add, that some of the 
grammarians hold it to be also of 
the measure ending with a fern, alif, and 
therefore assign to it no n. un.:] A kind of tree, (S, 
K,) of those growing in sands, (S, TA,) resembling 
the kind called growing as a branch [in the 
TA 4“=^, for which I read '-.t-ir .J from a single 
stem, to the height of the stature of a man, the 
leaves whereof are what are termed [q. v .,

smaller, the colour being one; and the odour 
thereof is pleasant: it grows in sands, and 
therefore the poets make frequent mention of the 
wild bulls' and cows' taking refuge among this 
and other trees of the sands, burrowing at their 
roots to hide themselves there, and to protect 
themselves from the heat and cold and rain, but 
not among the trees in hard ground, 
for burrowing in the sand is easy: (AHn, TA:) its 
fruit is like the [or jujube], bitter, and is 


eaten by camels in its fresh moist state, and its 
roots are red, (AHn, K,) intensely red: (AHn, TA:) 
AHn adds, a man of the Benoo-Asad informed

“shunning” it. (Kull pp. 30 and 31.) Hence the

the phrase JYI J'; said to be no evidence of the 
use of J' j' as a pi. of J j' in a general way by the 
Arabs of the classical ages, as it is here added 
merely as a corroborative. (MF in art. -J.) [See

be SKI; hut this is at variance with the authority 


of the leading lexicologists: the same word, SKI, is 
also explained in the K as signifying a disease in a 
limb, or member, in consequence of which one 
part is [as it were] eaten by another; [a meaning 
which I believe to be correct, (see 3Bj although 
SM says,] but this is identical with the itch, or an 
itching: and J, i>*B is a vulgar term for the same; 
and so is J, SKI, with medd, given as correct by 
Eth-Tha'alibee, in [his book entitled] the Mudaf

ElKhafajee. (TA.) One says, SIS) lS- 2 ***. iB!

a particle of determination: (Mughnee & c.:) or, 
accord, to some, it is a conjunct noun, and this is 
the correct opinion; but some say it is a conjunct 
particle; and some, a particle of determination: 
(I 'AK p. 40:) [it is equivalent to our article The;] 
as in [The man]: (S and K in art. fji, and I 
'Ak p. 48:) accord, to Kh, [what is termed] the 
determinative is 3' [altogether, and therefore it is 
called by some “the determinative alif and lam“]; 
but accord, to Sb, it is the J alone; [wherefore it is 
called by some, as in the S &c., “the lam 
of determination;”;] so that accord, to Kh, the 
hemzeh is a hemzeh of disjunction; but accord, to 
Sb, it is a hemzeh of conjunction: (I 'Ak ubi 
supra:) [J says,] the J being quiescent, the 
conjunctive ' is prefixed to it in order that it may 
commence therewith; but when it is conjoined 
with what precedes it, the ' is dropped, as 
in (S in art. (*_A) Sometimes the Arabs 

suppress hemzeh after it; and sometimes they 
also suppress the ' of the article itself: thus, 
for they say and j*li. (zj, cited in TA 
in art. *4:'.) In the dial, of some of the people of 
El-Yemen, (TA in art. 4, q. v.,) or in the dial,

as known [to the hearer or reader in a particular 
and definite sense]: (Mughnee, I 'Ak ubi supra:)

[BOOKI.] 


first, by its being mentioned [before]; 
(Mughnee;) as in [the words of the Kur lxxiii. 15 
and 16,] <4j <4 

Jj-“J1I [Like as we sent unto Pharaoh an apostle, 
and Pharaoh disobeyed the apostle]; (Mughnee, I 
'Ak;) in which case, the pronoun may supply the 
place which it and the noun that it accompanies 
occupies: secondly, by its being conceived in the 
mind; as in [the Kur ix. 40,] 4*11 ^ U* it 
[When they two were in the cave]: and thirdly, by 
its being applied to a thing present; and accord, 
to Ibn-'Osfoor, this does not occur except 
after nouns of indication, as in J4jH 'i* *4 

[This man (lit. this, the man,) came to me]; or 
after is 1 in calling, as in cJa-jlt t# I U [O man]; or 
after 4 denoting a thing's happening suddenly, 
or unexpectedly, as in lii cAji [I went 
forth, and lo, there was the lion]; or after the 
noun denoting the present time, as u>il [Now]: 
but this requires consideration; for you say to the 
reviler of a man in you presence, J44 1 ^ 

[Revile not thou the man]; and because that 
which is after 4 does not render determinate 
anything present at the time of speaking; and 
because that in u^l is really redundant, 
being inseparable, which the determinative is 
never known to be: the good example in this case 
is the saying in the Kur [v. 5], 44- 4-1 CiUSI ^ jilt 
[This day I have completed for you your religion]. 

(Mughnee.) It is also used to denote the 

species: first, to denote the totality of the 
individuals of the species; and this may have its 
place supplied by J£ used in its proper sense; 
(Mughnee, I 'Ak * ubi supra;) as in [the Kur iv. 
32,] i34j [For man was created 

weak]: secondly, to denote the totality of the 
properties of the individuals, or the combination 
of all those properties in one thing; and this 
may have its place supplied by J£ used in a 
tropical sense; as in file, JkjM [Zeyd is the 
man in respect of knowledge; as though he 
combined in himself the knowledge of all the 
individuals of his species]; i. e., he is the 
complete, or perfect, [or we would rather say, 
preeminent,] in knowledge; and hence, [in the 
Kur ii. 1,] 4LS1I ^ [That is the book, or scripture; 
as though combining in itself the excellences of 
all other books or scriptures; or meaning that is 
preeminently the book, or scripture]: and thirdly, 
to denote the quiddity, or essence; and this may 
not have its place supplied by J£ used either 
properly or tropically; as in the saying, [in the 
Kur xxi. 31,] ^ J£ 4-«ll j* Uliij [And we 
have made of water (meaning, accord, to 
common opinion, sperma genitale,) everything 
living]; or, accord, to some, it is used in this case 
to distinguish a thing as known [in a particular 


sense] by its being conceived in the mind. 
(Mughnee.) — — It is also used to denote 
predominance of application; as in ■44*11 [The 
city], meaning the city of the Apostle; and 4t41l 
[The book], meaning the book of Seebaweyh: and 
in this case, it may not be suppressed, except 
when the noun is used vocatively, or when it is 
prefixed to another noun which it governs in the 
gen. case; and in some anomalous instances, as 
in UJU=> li* [This is the star Capella, rising], 
originally jjj* 1I. (I 'Ak p. 51.) [In a case of this 
kind, it is said in the Mughnee to be redundant; 
but I think it is clearly not so in any of the 
instances here mentioned, except the last; and 
this I would rather assign to a category yet to be 
noticed, in which Jl is certainly redundant, and, 

by rule, inseparable.] It is also prefixed to a 

noun transferred from its original application to 
that of a proper name; it being so prefixed 
to convey an allusion to the original signification; 
and such noun being generally an epithet, 
as 4ijU.; but sometimes an inf. n., as >144; 
and sometimes a generic noun, as Cp*j; so that in 
any of these cases you may prefix Jl, saying 4 jUJI 
and J441I and with a view to the original 

signification; and you may suppress it, with a 
view to the actual state [which is that of a proper 
name]: for when you mean that a name of this 
kind is given as one ominous of good, you prefix 
the Jl in order to indicate this; as when you 
say 4 J4JI with a view to a person's being thus 
named to prognosticate that he will live and be a 
tiller, or cultivator; but when you only consider it 
as a proper name, you do not prefix the J: thus 
the prefix Jl conveys a meaning not obtained 
without it; and therefore it is not redundant, as 
some assert it to be. (I 'Ak p. 50.) [The author of 
the Mughnee is one of those who 

consider Jl redundant in this case.] It is in 

some cases redundant: and in some of these, it is 
inseparable; as in [a proper name which cannot 
be used with a view to an original application 
from which it has been transferred to that of a 
proper name though it may have been 
so transferred, such as] cjiUI, which is the name 
of a certain idol that was at Mekkeh [so called 
because a man used to moisten with 

clarified butter, for the pilgrims, at the place 
thereof]; and, accord, to some, [as before 
mentioned,] in gVI; and in the conjunct 
nouns lS^I and its variations, accord, to those 
who hold that a noun of this kind is rendered 
determinate by its complement: in other cases, 
where it is redundant, it is separable; and this is 
when it is prefixed to a proper name by poetic 
licence, as in Ji jVI diU) for jijl ejli, a species 
of truffle; or, accord, to Mbr, this is not a proper 


name, and the Jl is not redundant; and when it is 
prefixed to a specificative, as in o^ll Cnk> for 
'—4, accord, to the Basrees, who hold, in 
opposition to the Koofees, that the specificative 
may only be indeterminate; (I 'Ak p. 49;) [and, in 
like manner, as redundant and separable,] it 
is irregularly prefixed [by poetic licence] in u-“VI 
[q. v.], when it is left in its original form with 

kesr. (T.) Accord, to the Koofees, and some 

of the Basrees, and many of the later authors, it 
may also supply the place of the affixed pronoun; 
and such they hold to be the case in the saying in 
the Kur [lxxix. 41], lS j4l ja 4411 up [Verily 
Paradise, it shall be his place of abode]; and 
in 4Ljll g-*- JP-4 cjj [I passed by a man 
beautiful in his face]; and 0411 j JUill jjj 4 j-i 
[Zeyd was beaten, his back and his belly]; 
when <^41 and j44l and oMl are thus in the 
nom. case: but those who deny its being used in 
this manner hold that <1 is to be understood in 
the verse of the Kur, and in the other 
examples: and Ibn-Malik restricts the licence 
to cases not including the [or complement 
of Jl used in the manner which is here next to be 

explained]. (Mughnee.) It is also a conjunct 

noun in the sense of and its variations; and 
as such is prefixed to an act. part, n., and to a 
pass. part, n., and, as some say, to a simple 
epithet; (Mughnee, and I' Ak p. 43;) as mjI 44I 
[which is equivalent to m gJl], and m jJ4»ill 
[which is equivalent to m gUI], and 0“*=“^ 
‘441: (I ’Ak:) but this last not to be regarded, as it 
cannot be rendered by means of a verb. 
(Mughnee.) As such, also, it is sometimes 
prefixed to an adverbial noun, (Mughnee and I 
'Ak,) extraordinarily; (I 'Ak;) as in the saying, 0“ 
Cljli -c-luu lg£Li Jl jd ^ [WhoSO 

ceases not to be grateful, or thankful, for what is 
with him, or what he has, he is worthy of a state 
of life such as is attended with plenty.] (Mughnee 
and I 'Ak.) As such it is also sometimes prefixed 
to a nominal proposition; as in the saying, 

4-i -4 j -41- JJ 411 Jj-jll jj*ll [Of the 

people of whom is the apostle of God, of those to 
whom the necks of the sons of Ma' add 
have become abased]. (Mughnee and I ’Ak.) And 
as such it is also sometimes prefixed to a verbal 
proposition, of which the verb is an aor.; 
which shows that it is not [in this case] a particle 
of determination; (Mughnee;) as in the 
phrase, £-4411 J-**JI [The voice of the 

ass that has his ear, or ears, cut off]. (T and 
Mughnee.) But all these three cases are peculiar 
to poetry; contrary to the opinion of Akh, 
and, with respect to the last case, to that of Ibn- 
Malik. (Mughnee.) [Respecting the last instance, 
see also art. £^.] Another instance of its usage 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version Vl.l 75 


prefixed in this sense to an aor. is the saying, I* 
Cul [Thou art not the judge 
whose judgment is approved]; (IAmb, T, I 'Ak) a 
saying of ElFarezdak: (IAmb, T:) it is 

an extraordinary case; (I 'Ak;) and is [said to be] 
an instance of a had poetic license, the like of 
which in prose would be an error by 
common consent. (Expos, of the Shudhoor edh- 
Dhahab.) In like manner, one says, accord, to 
AZ, meaning This is he who beats 

thee; and >4 >-411 <— yi j I saw him who beats thee; 
and j4lU £-4>ll I i* This is what is appropriated to 
poetry. (T: [in which this last ex. is perhaps 
intended to intimate that the prefixing of Jl in 
this manner to a verb is allowable only in 
poetry.]) — — The Arabs also say, j .h-^-J I 4 
fUi: jl jjjill j* j ^Ijj meaning fljj jl 0? i>-“i 
k— 4 LP J4 j [He is more strongly fortified, or 

protected against attack, than that he will be 
sought, or desired, and he is more mighty than 
that he will be injured; i. e., too strongly fortified, 
or protected against attack, to be sought, or 
desired, and too mighty to be injured: see j>] 
(TA in art. fjk [But is there erroneously 

put for O .!-^' 1 .]) — Among strange usages, is that 
of (J as an interrogative, mentioned by Ktr; 
as in ciJ*i J in the sense of * 4*3 Ji [Didst thou 
do? or hast thou done?]. (Mughnee.) JJ Anything 
which has a quality requiring it to be regarded as 
sacred, or inviolable; which has some right 
pertaining to it: and thus used in particular 

senses here following. (R, TA.) Relationship; 

or nearness with respect to kindred; (Fr, T, S, M, 
R, K;) as also J, <!j, (Fr, T, K,) of which the pi.

And so in a trad, of 'Alee, JVI y=Sj j -4*11 [He

accord, to some. (Bd.) And so in the saying of 
Aboo-Bekr, above referred to, when he heard the 
rhyming prose of Museylimeh, Of j j4 fl li* 
J] [This is language which did not proceed from 
lordship]: so explained by A ’Obeyd: (Suh, TA:) 
or it has here another signification, mentioned 
before; the meaning being, which did not come 
from the origin whence came the Kur-an: or, 
accord, to some, it has here the signification next 

following. (TA.) Revelation, or inspiration. 

(K, TA.) — — lIVI also signifies God: [like the 
word 7X or rather 165 as used in Hebrew:] (T, S, 
M, K:) so say Mujahid and Esh-Shaabee: (T:) and 
so it is said to signify in the verse of the Kur cited 
above: (T, TA:) [and so it seems to signify in 
the saying of Aboo-Bekr, also cited above, accord, 
to the M:] but Aboo-Is- hak disallows this; and so 
does Suh, in the R. (TA.) Ibn-El-Kelbee says, (M,) 
when JJ ends any name, it has this meaning, and 
is the complement of a prefixed noun; and so JjJ; 
(M, K;) as in Jjj4 [and Jjjj4 &c.]; and so say 
most of the learned: (TA:) but this is not a valid 
assertion; for were it so, J) 44 and the like would 
be perfectly deck: (M:) some say that these 
names are constructed inversely, after the 
manner of the language of the ’Ajam; Jl and JJ 
meaning servant, and the first part of the name 
being a name of God. (Suh, TA.) — I. q. 

[used in a pi. sense]. (Mughnee in art. VJ. [See 
what is said to be an ex. of this meaning in a 
verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited in art. VI in the 

present work.]) [It is said that] JJ is also 

syn. with j'4- [A neighbour; &c.]. (K: [and so, 
accord, to the TA, in the M; but I have consulted 
the M without finding this explanation, and think 
it to be probably a mistranscription for jlj 4 , (see 
above,) as in the T and R.]) SJJ: see Jj. JlJ >i A 
thing, or an affair, relating, or attributable, 
to J'i I, meaning either God, or revelation or 
inspiration. (TA.) VI VI [in its primitive 
acceptation, being composed of the interrogative 
hemzeh and the negative V,] denotes an 
interrogation respecting a negative, as in the 
saying [of the poet], lit 4-1 p jLkJil VI 
ujtjil ilaV lS-JI ,jSVl [Is there not any patience 


belonging to Selma, or has she hardiness, when I 
experience what persons like me have 
experienced?]: (Mughnee, K:) and when used in 
this manner, it is put before a 

nominal proposition only, and governs like the 
negative V [when used without the interrogative 
hemzeh]. (Mughnee.) — — It also denotes a 
wish; as in the saying [of the poet], VI 

diVLilul 3 clilji Li c_j|>s c. 1 L ^ [ PvTiy there not 

be a life which has declined whereof the 
returning is possible, so that it may repair what 
the hand of negligences hath marred?]; for which 
reason *-4 jj is mansoob, because it is the 
complement of a wish, coupled with j-»: and used 
in this manner, also, it is put before a nominal 
proposition only, [Jj in the verse above being 
a qualificative, like an epithet,] and it governs 
like the negative V [without the interrogative 
hemzeh], and has no enunciative 

either expressed or understood. (Mughnee.) 

It also denotes reproof, or reproach, (T, 
Mughnee, K,) and disapproval; as in the saying 
[of the poet], - . > ciiAlj j JJ- ciiij cl jc .4 VI 
f j* [Is there no self-restraint to him whose 

youth hath declined, and announced 
hoariness, after which is to follow decrepitude?]: 
(Mughnee, K:) and used in this manner, also, it is 
put before a nominal proposition only, and 
governs as in the cases mentioned above, 
(Mughnee,) or before a verb [also], which is 
always marfooa; as in the phrase Jc fxh VI 
[Dost not thou repent of thine actions?] and VI 
^jljj?- [Art not thou ashamed for 

thyself, or of thyself, with respect to thy 
neighbours?] and 4 j — j'-U VI [Dost not thou fear 

thy Lord?]. (T.) It also denotes i>= j=-, (T,) 

or i>= 3 ^l, and both of which signify the 

asking, or requiring, a thing; (Mughnee, K; *) but 
the former means the doing so with gentleness; 
(Mughnee, K;) and the latter, the doing so 
with urgency: (Mughnee:) and when used in this 
manner, [also,] it is said to be composed of V 
with the interrogative hemzeh; (TA;) and is put 
before a verbal proposition only; (Mughnee;) as 
in the saying [in the Kur xxiv. 22 ], j?*j jl jjf=jJ VI 
kill [Do not ye, or wherefore do not ye, (see b>l,) 
like that God should forgive you?] (Mughnee, K,) 
and [in the same, ix. 13 ,] fij'-JI I jj 4 jjljliiVI 

[Will not ye, or wherefore will not ye, fight a 
people who have broken their oaths?]; 
(Mughnee;) or before a mejzoom or marfooa aor., 
both of these forms being mentioned on the 
authority of the Arabs, as in JSJ JjS VI and VI 
JSJ Jjjj [wilt not thou, or wherefore wilt not 

thou, alight and eat?]. (Ks, T.) It is also an 

inceptive particle, (S, Mughnee, K,) of which

[BOOKI.] 


those who parse show the place but neglect the 
meaning, (Mughnee,) used to give notice of 
something about to be said, [like as Now, and 
why, (by the former of which I think it is 
generally best rendered when thus used,) are 
often employed in our language, and like as dKka 
(which is remarkable for its near agreement with 
it in sound) is often used in Greek,] (S, Mughnee, 
K,) and importing averment, because it is 
composed of the interrogative hemzeh and the 
negative V which, when thus composed, have this 
import, (Mughnee, K,) like jll, and 
because the interrogative particle resembles the 
particle of negation, and the negation of a 
negation is an affirmation, (Ham p. 589,) and 
like 1*1 before an oath: (Z, Mughnee:) [it may 
therefore be further rendered by our word 
surely;; for this word (as Dr. Johnson says in his 
Dictionary) "is often used rather to intend and 
strengthen the meaning of the sentence, than 
with any distinct and explicable meaning:"] or 
it signifies 1*^ [verily, or truly]: (M voce 4':) it is 
put before both the [kinds of] propositions, [the 
nominal and the verbal;] (Mughnee;) as in the 
saying [in the Kur ii. 12], A 44 VI 

[meaning Now surely it is they who are the 
lightwitted], (Mughnee, K,) and [in the same, xi. 
11,] fjj VI [meaning Now 

surely, on the day of its coming to them, it shall 
not be averted from them], (Mughnee,) in 
which fjj appears to be the object of 

government of which is the enunciative 

of 641 whence it has been argued that, as the 
object of government of the enunciative of l> 4 
precedes that verb, the enunciative itself may 
precede it: (I 'Ak pp. 74 and 75:) [J says,] you 
say, jr J-4 l4j d! VI [Now surely Zeyd is going 
forth], like as you say, jr jl4 li j 6 f!4l [Know 
thou that Zeyd is going forth]: (S:) Ks says, VI is 
used to give notice of what is about to be said, 
and is followed by a command and a prohibition 
and an enunciation, as in 4 VI [Now stand thou], 
and V VI [Now stand not thou], and I 4 j u] VI 
^la 3a [Now surely Zeyd has stood, or has just now 
stood]. (T.) When it is put before the particle [4] 
used to give notice of what is about to be said, it 
is merely an inceptive, as in the saying, [of the 
poet], (jMl Jc. 6-* jl3 13 j-Lil 13 Vl [Now be thou 
free from evil, O abode of Meiya, during wear and 
tear]. (AAF, M.) — — Lth says, sometimes VI 
is immediately followed by another V; and he 
cites the following ex.: VI 664 lie ^Ull j jUia 
6* JJ 44* d? V [Then he began to drive away the 
people from us, saying, Now is there no way to 
Hind?]: and one says to a man, "Did such and 
such things happen?" and he answers, V VI [Why 
no]: he holds VI to be used to give notice of what 


is about to be said, and V to be a negative. (T.) VI 
and VVI, and ?VI &c.: see art. Jl. VI is a particle 
denoting (Msb in art. Mughnee, K;) 

i. e., when followed by a future, exciting to an 
action, and seeking or desiring or demanding the 
performance of it; and when followed by 
a preterite, reproof for not doing a thing; (Msb 
ubi supra;) syn. with Vii; (T, TA;) and peculiar to 
enunciative verbal propositions, (Mughnee, 
K,) like the other particles used for the same 
purpose. (Mughnee.) You say, [134 6*4 VI 
Wherefore wilt not thou do such a thing? and] VI 
134 cJ*i . [wherefore didst not thou such a thing?] 
(T, TA,) meaning, (TA,) or as though meaning, 
(T,) 134 6*4 -A ■ J. (T, TA.) — It also means J 
V; the u being incorporated into the J, which is 
written with teshdeed: (T, TA:) in which case, it is 
not to be confounded with the foregoing particle. 
(Mughnee.) You say, 3113 6*4 VI jljii [I 
commanded him that he should not do that]; and 
you may say, 3113 Jiii V 6 kljil; it occurs in the 
old copies of the Kur written in the former 
manner in some places, and in the latter manner 
in other places. (T, TA.) In the saying in the Kur 
[xxvii. 31 ], Zjc- I jl*j VI, [which may mean That ye 
exalt not yourselves against me, or exalt ye not 
yourselves against me,] it may be a compound 
of u 1 governing a mansoob aor. and the 
negative V, or of the explicative u 1 and the 
prohibitive V. (Mughnee.) [It often has J prefixed 
to it, forming the compound 331, which signifies 
That, or in order that,... not; and may frequently 
be rendered by lest; as in the Kur ii. 145, uj4j Vi! 
44* jiSllc. pJill That, or in order that, there 
may not be, or lest there should be, to men, 
against you, any allegation.] VI, [regarded as a 
simple word,] not to be confounded with the 
compound of the conditional qj and the 
negative V, (Mughnee at the end of the article on 
this word,) is used in four manners. (The same in 
the beginning of the art.) First, (Mughnee,) it is 
used (as a particle, S, Msb,) to denote exception; 
[meaning Except, save, or saving; and sometimes 
but; and sometimes but not; as will be seen 
below;] (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K; [in which last it 
is mentioned in art. Jl, and again, as in the S, in 
the last division of the work;]) and to 
denote exception, it is used in five manners; after 
an affirmation, and a negation, and a portion of a 
sentence devoid of the mention of that 
from which the exception is made, and when the 
thing excepted precedes that from which the 
exception is made, and when these two are 
disunited in kind, in which last case it has the 
meaning of 6)41 [but when the sentence is 
negative, and but not when the sentence is 
affirmative]. (S, TA.) You say, I4j VI ^ jail jla [The 


people, or company of men, stood, except Zeyd]; 
i. e., Zeyd was not included in the predicament of 
the people, or company of men: (Msb:) and it is 
said in the Kur [ii. 250], (T,) 344 VI 4L> I jjjAA 

[And they drank of it, except a few of them]: (T, 
Mughnee, K:) here VJa is governed in the accus. 
case by VI, (Mughnee, K,) accord, to the most 
correct opinion: (Mughnee:) accord, to Th, it is so 
because there is no negation in the beginning of 
the sentence. (T.) And it is also said in the Kur 
[iv. 69], (T,) pin? 6*4 VI i 6*s U [They had not done 
it, or they would not do it, except a few of them]: 
(T, Mughnee, K:) here 66* is in the nom. case as 
being a partial substitute, (Mughnee, K,) accord, 
to the Basrees, (Mughnee,) i. e., as being a 
[partial] substitute for the [pronoun] j [in »jl*a], 
for it may here be so without perversion of the 
meaning, whereas it cannot be so without such 
perversion when the sentence is affirmative: 
(TA:) accord, to the Koofees, VI is a conjunction, 
like the conjunctive V; (Mughnee:) accord, to 
Th, Jj 13 is here in the nom. case because 
the sentence commences with a negative: (T:) or 
in a sentence [like this,] which is not affirmative, 
in which the thing excepted is united in kind to 
that from which the exception is made, accord, to 
the opinion which is generally preferred and 
which commonly obtains, the noun signifying the 
thing excepted is a substitute for the noun 
signifying that from which the exception is made; 
but it is allowable to put it in the accus. case 
according to the general rule respecting 
exception; so that one says, -4 j V) 34.1 jla U and VI 
l-yj [There stood not any one, except Zeyd]: and 
the same is the case in a prohibitive sentence; as 
in 4j VI J4I V and l4j VI [Let not any one 
stand, except Zeyd]; and in an interrogative 
sentence; as in 4j VI 34.1 jla 6* and l4j VI [Did any 
one stand, except Zeyd?]; when, in such 
sentences, the thing excepted is united in kind to 
that from which the exception is made. (I ’Ak p. 
162.) You say also, 4 j VI <^3314 U [There came not 
to me any, save Zeyd], without mentioning that 
from which the exception is made; (TA;) 
and I4j VI U [1 beat not any, save Zeyd]; 

and 4 J) X '—>1)3-“ 1-* [I passed not by any, save by 
Zeyd]; (T Ak p. 164;) the case of the 
noun signifying the thing excepted being the 
same as if VI were not mentioned: (I' Ak ubi 
supra, and TA:*) but you may not 
say, affirmatively, 14 j VI cj or the like. (I 'Ak 
ubi supra.) When the thing excepted precedes 
that from which the exception is made, if 
the sentence is affirmative, the noun signifying 
the former must be in the accus. case; as in VI jla 
j j»!l I4j [Except Zeyd, the people, or company of 
men, stood]: and so, accord, to the usage 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version VI. 1 77 


generally preferred, when the sentence is not 
affirmative; as in jj4l Ij) VI jlSU [Except Zeyd, 
the people, or company of men, stood not]; 
hut recorded instances allow one's saying also, l* 
j j4l 4 j VI jl3. (I 'Ak p. 163.) When the thing 
excepted is disunited in kind from that 
from which the exception is made, if the sentence 
is affirmative, the noun signifying the former 
must likewise be in the accus. case; as in jj4l jla 
IjUi. VI [The people, or company of men, stood, 
hut not an ass], and O'-*? VI ^ jail [I beat the 

people, but not an ass], &c.: (I' Ak p. 162:) and so, 
accord, to the generality of the Arabs, when 
the sentence is negative; as in I V] jjall jla U 
[The people stood not, but an ass]; (I' Ak p. 163;) 
and I jl-*?. VI jjall dul j U [1 saw not the people, but 
an ass]; VI being here syn. with j£l; as also in the 
Kur [xlii. 22], where it is said, VI I jki <jlc. jsllii V 
j"l L?® “-jill [I ask not of you a recompense for 
it, but affection in respect of relationship]; (Msb;) 
and in the same xx. 1 and 2, 44° 41jjl '- i 
SjSd VI jl jail [We have not sent down unto 

thee the Kur-an that thou shouldest suffer 
fatigue, but as an admonition]; (Bd, Jel;) or it 
is here syn. with 3j [which in this case means the 
same as d£l]: (S:) so, too, when the sentence 
resembles a negative, being prohibitive 
or interrogative; (I’ Ak p. 163, explained in p. 
162;) [thus, I VI jjall y jda j V means Beat not 
thou the people, but an ass; and] djjlS V jla 
i jja VI 1444 Ijiaia diiii 4 ji [in the Kur x. 98] 
means And wherefore did not any inhabitants of 
a town believe, before the punishment 
befell them, and their belief profit them, but the 
people of Jonas? for these were different from the 
former. (T.) When VI is repeated for the 
purpose of corroboration, it has no effect upon 
what follows it, except that of corroborating the 
first exception; as in 44 VI ij VI 44 djji U 
[I passed not by any one, except Zeyd, except thy 
brother], in which 44 is a substitute for Aj, for 
it is as though you said, 44 ij VI 44 d j ji li; 
and as in I jie. VI j lij VI ^ jail jla [The people 
stood, except Zeyd, and except' Amr], 
originally I jie j lij VI. When the repetition is 
not for that purpose, if the sentence is devoid of 
the mention of that from which the exception is 
made, you make the governing word [which is 
the verb] to affect one, whichever you please, of 
the nouns signifying the things excepted, and put 
the others in the accus. case, so that you say, jla U 
1 14 VI I jic V] ij VI [There stood not any, save 
Zeyd, save' Amr, save Bekr]; but if the sentence is 
not devoid of the mention of that from which the 
exception is made, different rules are observed 
accord, as the things excepted are mentioned 


before that from which the exception is made or 
after it: in the former case, all must be put in the 
accus., whether the sentence be affirmative or 
not affirmative; as in jjall IJ4 VI I jic. VI lij VI jla 
[Except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, the 
people stood], and jjall 1 14 VI Ijkc. VI lij VI jlili 
[Except Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, the 
people stood not]: in the latter case, when the 
sentence is affirmative, all must likewise be put 
in the accus., so that you say, lij VI j jail jla 
114 V] I jic VI [The people stood, except Zeyd, 
except' Amr, except Bekr]; but when the sentence 
is not affirmative, the same rule is observed 
with respect to one of them as when the 
exception is not repeated, accord, to the usage 
generally preferred, or it may be put in the accus., 
which is rarely done, and the rest must be put in 
the accus., so that you say, I jki VI i j VI 4.1 jla U 
1 14 Vl [There stood not any one, except 
Zeyd, except' Amr, except Bekr, accord, to the 
more approved usage], ajj being a substitute 
for a=J, or you may make the other nouns which 
remain to be substitutes. (I' Ak pp. 164 — 166.) — 
— Secondly, (Mughnee,) it is used as a 
qualificative, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K,) in the 
manner of 34, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] in the place 
of 14, (S,) [i. e.] as syn. with 14, (T, Msb,) 
and (T;) [both meaning the same, i. e. Other 
than; or not, as used before a subst. or an 
adjective;] but its primary application is to 
denote exception, and its use as a qualificative 
is adventitious; whereas the primary application 
of 14 is as a qualificative, and its use to denote 
exception is adventitious. (S.) It [generally] 
follows an indeterminate, unrestricted pk; (Msb;) 
or an indeterminate pi., or the like thereof, is 
qualified by it and by that which follows it; 
(Mughnee, K;) the noun which follows it being 
put in the same case as that which precedes it. 
(S.) The following is an ex. of the indeterminate 
pi.: (Mughnee, K:) 1441 kill VI 4ji 44 JS ji [if 
there had been in them (namely the heavens and 
the earth) deities other than God, or not God, 
assuredly they would have become in a state of 
disorder, or ruin; occurring in the Kur xxi. 22]; 
(Fr, T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K;) VI here 
meaning lS 4, (Fr, T,) or 4, (Msb, TA,) 
and -dll VI being a qualificative of 411. (TA.) And 
the following is an ex. of the like of an 
indeterminate pi.: J# saL jjs cilia ciaii 
44 VI cljj^VI 4 [She (the camel) was made to 
lie down, and threw her breast upon a tract of 
ground in which were few sounds other than 
her broken yearning cry for her young one]; for 
the determination of cl ^=VI [by the article JI] is 
generical: (Mughnee, K:) this verse is by Dhu-r- 


Rummeh. (S in art. 4.) The following is an ex. of 
the like of a pi..: (Mughnee:) it is by Lebeed: 
(T:) ~ j • -~*H V) Cal jil ja j ojjc. jjjll w ji jl 

141' [If it had been other than I, (O) 
Suleyma, today, the befalling of misfortunes 
would have altered him; other than the sharp 
sword diversified with wavy marks or streaks or 
grain, or of which the edge is of steel and the 
middle of the broad side of soft iron]. (T, 
Mughnee. [But in the latter, in the place of jjjjll, I 
find j*Jl, i. e. ever.]) What Sb says necessarily 
implies its not being a condition that the word 
qualified must be a pi. or the like thereof; for he 
gives as an ex., JJ 34 j 4i jlS jl [if there had 
been with us a man other than Zeyd, we should 
have been overcome]. (Mughnee.) Another ex. of 
the same usage of VI is the following: VJ jjall 
4 j [The people came to me, others than Zeyd, or 
not Zeyd]. (S.) [And 44 jC VI jSii j Ye are no 
other than human beings like us. (Kur xxxvi. 14.)] 
And the saying [in the Kur xliv. 56], 4a V 
4 j'VI jill Vj cjiil [They shall not taste therein 
death, other than the first death]; VI here 
meaning cs4: (T:) or, accord, to some, it here 
means 4 [after]. (Jel.) And the saying of 'Amr 
Ibn-Maadee-kerib, Vj *44 14-1 ja jUi pi Ji j 

jllajall [And every brother, his brother forsakes 
him, or separates himself from him, by the life of 
thy father, other than the Farhadan; which is the 
name of the two stars b and r of Ursa Minor]; 
as though he said jjaajall jj4 (S:) but Ibn-El- 
Hajib regards this instance as a deviation from a 
general rule; for he makes it a condition of 
the use of VI as a qualificative that it must be 
impossible to use it for the purpose of denoting 
exception: (Mughnee:) Fr says that this verse has 
the meaning of a negation, and therefore VI here 
governs the nom. case; as though the poet said, 
There is not any one but his brother forsakes 
him, except the Farkadan. (T.) When it is used as 
a qualificative, it differs from 14 inasmuch as 
that the noun qualified by it may not be 
suppressed; so that one may not say, VI 
4j [meaning There came to me not Zeyd]; 
whereas one says, 4j l4 <44-: and, accord, to 
some, in this also; that it may not be used as 
such unless it may be used to denote exception; 
so that one may say, 34 Vj j* j? is 4 [I have a 
dirhem, not a danik], because one may say 14^ VJ 
[except a danik]; but not c4 VJ [not a good one], 
because one may not say lc=^ VI [except a good 
one]; but it may be said that this is at variance 
with what they assert respecting the phrase j 
4^1 1-^4, and with the ex. given by Sb, and with 
the saying of Ibn-El-Hajib mentioned above. 
(Mughnee.) — — Thirdly, (Mughnee,)

sometimes, (S, Msb,) it is used as a conjunction, 
(Mughnee, K,) in the manner of j (S, Mughnee, 
K,) consociating both literally and as to the 
meaning, as mentioned by Akh and Fr and AO, 
(Mughnee,) [i. e.] as syn. with j [And]. (Msb.) 
Thus in the saying, dyA' VI k=A file gAll jjA VU1

Akh and Fr and AO; (Mughnee;) i. e., and those 
who have acted wrongfully also, to them there 
shall not he, against you, any allegation: (Msh:) 
Fr explains it as meaning that the wrongdoer has 
no allegation of which account should be taken; 
and this is correct, and is the opinion held hy Zj. 
(T.) Thus, too, in the saying [in the Kur xxvii. 10

[The apostles shall not fear in my presence, 
and neither shall he who hath acted wrongfully, 
then hath done good instead, after evil; as some 
explain it; hut others say that ^ Vj here

explained as meaning ; and K.) And thus in the

not to he made to lie down in a state of hunger, or 
with which we direct our course to a desert 
region]; (S ubi supra, Mughnee; [but in one copy 
of the former, in the place of I find 
and in my copy of the latter, ^jj;]) meaning, A 
Aiu : (s ubi supra:) hut it is said that this is a 
mistake of the poet: (Mughnee:) so says Aboo- 
'Amr Ibn-El-'Ala; for, he says, VI is not to he 
introduced after Ail and J jk (TA:) and some say 
that the right reading is VI, with tenween, 
[perhaps a mistranscription, for VI,] 

meaning U-ai-i [in a pi. sense]: and 

some, that Ait; is a complete [or an attributive] 
verb, and ki.A> is a denotative of state; 
[consequently, that VI is a compound of u! 


and V, as in some other instances hereafter to be 
mentioned;] the meaning being, that are not 
disengaged, or not free, from fatigue [unless 
when made to lie down]. (Mughnee.) The 
following is also given as an ex. of the same 
kind: -dak VI jiill (jjl [1 see fortune, or 

time, to be like a water-wheel, with its people]: 
but the reading which is remembered to have 
been heard is jiAl lij : and if the former 
he correct, it may be explained on the 
supposition that is j 1 is the complement of an 
oath meant to be understood, and that V is 
suppressed, as in [the saying in the Kur xii. 
85,] ji 12*3 -dii; [so that the meaning is, I 
see not fortune, or time, to be aught save a water- 
wheel, with its people;] the form of the exceptive 
sentence which is devoid of the mention of that 
from which the exception is made indicating such 
an explanation. (Mughnee.) — — [Fifthly,] it 
occurs as syn. with AA [as a particle denoting 
exception, equivalent to our But; meaning both 
except and (after an oath or the like) only, 
or nothing more than]; as in the saying in the Kur 
[xxxviii. 13], JAjll VI jl [There was not 
any one but such as accused the apostles 
of lying], in which 'Ahd-Allah reads, in its 
place, Al; and for CK he reads fs-15; and as in the 
saying, ^AyAel VI dl; AllAi [1 ask, or keg, or 
beseech, thee by God but that thou give me; i. e., 
I do not ask of thee anything save thy giving me; 
the preterite here, as in many instances in which 
it is preceded by A1 (q. v.), not being a preterite in 
meaning]; for which one says also ^4^ 1 Al. (T.) 
— It is also a particle [or rather a compound of 
two words] denoting the complement of a 
condition; originally V jl, which form a 
compound that does not admit of [the 
pronunciation termed] imaleh, because u\ and V 
are particles. (T.) [It signifies, lit., If not.] It is 
followed by a fut., which it renders mejzoom; 
[and in this case it may he rendered as above, or 
hy unless;] as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 74], VI 
jVI SAia ji) i jlii [if ye do it not, or unless ye 
do it, there will he a weakness of faith and an 
appearing of unbelief in the earth]. (T.) [In like 
manner,] in a saying such as the following, [in 
the Kur ix. 40,] -dll j As i VI [If ye do not, 
or will not, aid him, certainly God aided him], it 
is only a compound of two words, the 
conditional u! and the negative V, and is distinct 
from VI of which the usages have been mentioned 
before, though Ibn-Malik has included it 
therewith. (Mughnee.) [Often in post-classical 
works, and perhaps in classical also, but seldom 
except when it is preceded by a condition with its 
complement, the verb or verbal proposition 
which should immediately follow it 


is suppressed; as in the like of the saying, a!*s jl 
VI j Aic. I IS if thou do such a thing, I 

forgive thee, or cancel thine offence; but if thou 
wilt not do it (i. e., VI,) I kill thee: 

sometimes also it ends a sentence, by an 
aposiopesis; the whole of what should follow it 
being suppressed: and sometimes the 

complement of the condition which precedes, as 
well as the verb or verbal proposition which 
should immediately follow it, is suppressed; so 
that you say, Ailis V] j IAS jl if thou do such a 
thing, excellent will it be, or the like, > A*ja, or 
the like, being understood,) but if not, I kill thee. 
Hence,] it sometimes has the meaning of A], 
[signifying Or, denoting an alternative, 
corresponding to a preceding Al, which signifies 
“either,”] as in the saying, ASAls VI j ji Ul 

[Either do thou speak to me or else (meaning VI j 
er“lA or if thou wilt not speak to me) be silent], i. 
e., AlA ji Ul j. (s.) [It is also followed by u', as 
in kill ilA ji VI Unless God should please; in the

being the reading of the Prophet [himself]: 
(TA:) [accord, to all these readings, the passage 
may be rendered, For the keeping of Kureysh, for 
their keeping to the journey of the winter and of 
the summer, or spring; the chapter going on to 
say, for this reason "let them worship the Lord of 
this House," &c. : or] the second and third 
readings are from 411, aor. 4lU; [and accord, to 
these readings, the passage may be rendered as 
above;] but accord, to the first reading, the 
meaning is, for the preparing and fitting out [&c.; 
i. e., preparing and fitting out men and beasts in 
the journey of the winter &c.]: so says IAmb; and 
Fr explains in the same manner the third 
reading: but IAar says that, accord, to this 
reading, the meaning is, the protecting [&c.]: he 
says that the persons who protected were four 
brothers, Hashim and 'Abd-Shems and El- 
Muttalib and Nowfal, the sons of 'Abd-Menaf: 
these gave protection to Kureysh in their 
procuring of corn: (T:) Hashim obtained a grant 
of security from the king of the Greeks, and 
Nowfal from Kisra, and 'Abd-Shems from the 
Nejashee, and ElMuttalib from the kings of 
Himyer; and the merchants of Kureysh used to 
go to and from the great towns of these kings 
with the grants of security of these brothers, and 
none opposed them: Hashim used to give 
protection (43-i [in the copies of the K 4ljj]) [to 
those journeying] to Syria, and 'Abd-Shems to 
Abyssinia, and ElMuttalib to El-Yemen, and 
Nowfal to Persia: (T, K: *) or j 4Ll in the Kur 
signifies a covenant, or an obligation; and what 
resembles permission, (» 34 , as in some copies of 
the K and in the TA,) or protection, (44, as in 
the CK,) with an obligation involving 
responsibility for safety; first obtained by 
Hashim, from the kings of Syria; (K, * TA;) and 
the explanation is, that Kureysh were dwelling in 
the sacred territory, (K,) having neither seed- 
produce nor udders [to yield them milk], (TA,) 
secure in the procuring of their provisions from 
other parts, and in their changes of place, in 
winter and summer, or spring; the people around 
them having their property seized; whereas, 
when any cause of mischief occurred to them, 
they said, "We are people of the sacred territory," 
and then no one opposed them: (K:) so in the O: 
(TA:) or the J is to denote wonder; and the 
meaning is, wonder ye at the 45U of Kureysh

agreeably with the first explanation which we 
have given]: others, that it is connected with what 
precedes; as J says; (TA;) the meaning being, I 
have destroyed the masters of the elephant to

uniting the journey of the winter and of the 
summer, or spring; that when they finished one, 
they should commence the other; (T, S;) and this 
is like the saying, liS] 6 li£l <L jL=, with 

suppression of the [conjunctive] j: (S:) but Ibn-

because the phrase "In the name of God" &c. 
occurs between the two chapters: [Bd, however, 
mentions that in Ubei's copy, the two compose 
one chapter:] secondly, because ‘-dL signifies 
the covenants, or obligations, which they 
obtained when they went forth on mercantile 
expeditions, and whereby they became secure. 
(TA.) | ‘-WJ [in like manner] signifies A writing of 
security, written by the king for people, that they

above: see 1 , last sentence. (TA.) The Jl is 
pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in using 
the vocative form of address [4111 11 ] because it 
is inseparably prefixed as an honourable 
distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause 
upon the vocative particle is intended in honour 
of the name; (S in art. -cJ;) and AAF says that it is 
also thus pronounced in a form of swearing; as 
in jiiil filial [an elliptical phrase, as will be shown 
below, meaning Then, by God, wilt thou indeed 
do such a thing?]; though he denies its being thus 
pronounced because it is inseparable; regarding 
it as a substitute for the suppressed hemzeh 
of 1VVI; (S in the present art.:) Sb mentions this 
pronunciation in 4111 U; and Th mentions the 
pronunciation of 4111 U also, with the conjunctive 
hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as used by the 
Arabs, the phrase Jjic.1 411 [o God, forgive me], 
for 4111 U; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) 
The word is pronounced in the manner 
termed [i. e., with the broad sound of the 
lengthened fet-h, and with a full sound of the 
letter J,] for the purpose of showing honour to it; 
but when it is preceded by a kesreh, [as in <U4 By 
God, and 411 <*1 «j In the name of God,] it 
is pronounced in the [contr.] manner 
termed lmAk AHat says that some of the vulgar 


say, 4UIJY [No, by God], suppressing the alif, 
which should necessarily be uttered, as in J^jll, 
which is in like manner written without alif; and 
he adds that some person has composed a verse 
in which the alif [in this word] is suppressed, 
erroneously. (Msb.) You say, I iS u? Aill <111, [ a verb 
being understood,] meaning Fear ye God, fear 
ye God, with respect to such a thing. (Marginal 
note in a copy of the Jami' es-Sagheer. [See 
another ex. voce »j£.]) And Jl*aY 4111 and <M 
J 1*4 V [By God, I will assuredly do such a thing]: 
in the former is understood a verb significant of 
swearing; and in the latter, [or in both, for a noun 
is often put in the accus. case because of a 
particle understood,] a particle [such as ^ or j] 
denoting an oath. (Bd in ii. 1 .) And AJis U <11, 
meaning U <111 j [By God, I did not, or have 
not done, such a thing]. (JK.) And 41 jl <11 
(tropical:) To God be attributed thy deed! (A in 
art. jJ:) or the good that hath proceeded from 
thee! or thy good deed! or thy gift! and what is 
received from thee! [and thy flow of eloquence! 
and the like]: a phrase expressive of admiration 
of anything: (TA in art. j>) [when said to an 
eloquent speaker or poet, it may be rendered 
divinely art thou gifted!]. And <H (tropical:) 
To God be attributed his deed! [&c.]. (S and K in 
art. j<) And 3)1411 <11 [meaning To God be 
attributed (the eloquence of) the sayer! or] 
how good, or beautiful, is the saying of the sayer, 
or of him who says [such and such words]! or it is 
like the phrase < 11 , meaning 

(assumed tropical:) To God be attributed his 
goodness! and his pure action! (Har p. 11 .) And <11 
[To God be attributed (the excel-lence, or 
goodness, or deed, &c., of) such a one!] explained 
by Az as meaning wonder ye at such a one: how 
perfect is he! (Har ibid.) [And 41 jjI <11: see 
art. _*!.] And cjii meaning AjJ <11 [lit. To God 
be thou attributed! i. e. to God be attributed thine 
excellence! or thy goodness! or thy deed! 
&c.]. (JK.) [Similar to 411, thus used, is the 
Hebrew expression '”’ 7 X 7 ^ after an epithet 
signifying “great” or the like.] uj*-?.Ij <JJ UJ 3 <ilUJ, 
in the Kur [ii. 151 ], said on the occasion of an 
affliction, means Verily to God we belong, as 
property and servants, He doing with us what 
He willeth, and verily unto Him we return in the 
ultimate state of existence, and He will 
recompense us. (Jel.) AZ mentions the 
phrase [meaning 4hiill Praise be to God]: 

but this is not allowable in the Kur-an: it is only 
related as heard from the Arabs of the desert, and 
those not knowing the usage of the Kur-an. (Az, 

TA.) 4 44-UI is an expression used in prayer; 

as also (JK, Msb;) meaning 4111 U [O God];

phrase, JAl u? 4, as some relate it, [the 
meaning intended seems to be, They did not hold

another verb: and such is the case in the saying, V 
AA >21 jll, meaning I will not refuse to thee, nor 
partially or wholly deprive thee of, 
sincere, honest, or faithful, advice: (Mgh:) or this 
last signifies I will not flag, or be remiss, nor fall

114], VIA jSJjlly V, meaning They will not fall

(IAar, T.) And the same meaning is assigned to 
the verb in the saying JA V j J, , jA JAall jl jl, in 
the Kur [xxiv. 22], by A'Obeyd: but the preferable 
rendering in this case is that of A Heyth, which

[in the masc.] being the sign of the pi., (M,) for it 
has j [for its termination] in the nom. case, and lS 
in the accus. and gen. (M, K.) It is never used but 
as a prefixed noun. (M, K.) The following are exs. 
of the nom. case: uJ P P j j J P ji J--i [We are 

possessors of strength, and possessors 
of vehement courage], in the Kur [xxvii. 23]; 
and Jji pO jVI P ji [The possessors of 

relationships, these have the best title 
to inheritance, one with respect to another], in 
the same [viii. last verse and xxxiii. 6]; (TA;) 
and JjWI jlji ^ iU. [The persons 
of understandings came to me]; and JLA.VI eOi jl 
[Those who are with child; occurring in the Kur 
lxv. 4]: (S:) and the following are exs. of 
the accus. and gen. cases: Jji j J Jj 

[And leave thou me, or let me alone, with the 
beliers, or discrediters, (i. e., commit their case to 
me,) the possessors of ease and plenty], in the 
Kur [lxxiii. 11]; and Jji « pP [Would 

weigh down the company of men possessing 
strength], in the same [xxviii. 76]. (TA.) j-VI Jjl j 
pP*, in the Kur [iv. 62], [And those, of you, who 
are possessors of command], (M, K, *) accord, to 
Aboo-Is-hak, (M,) means the companions of 
the Prophet, and the men of knowledge their 
followers, (M, K,) and the possessors of 
command, who are their followers, when also 
possessors of knowledge and religion: (K:) or, as 
some say, [simply] the possessors of command; 
for when these are possessors of knowledge and 
religion, and take, or adopt and maintain, and 
follow, what the men of knowledge say, to obey 
them is of divine obligation: and in general those 
who are termed J>VI jljl, of the Muslims, are 
those who superintend the affairs of such with 
respect to religion, and everything conducing to 
the right disposal of their affairs. (M.) JJ, accord, 
to Sb, is originally with j in the place of the [lS, i. 
e. the final] alif; and so is J=-; for the alifs [in 
these two particles] are not susceptible of imaleh; 
[i. e., they may not be pronounced ile and ’ale;] 
and if either be used as the proper name of a 
man, the dual [of the former] is yJJ and [that of 
the latter] Jj P; but when a pronoun is affixed to 
it, the alif is changed into ye, so that you say ^J 
and * 4 ^; though some of the Arabs leave it as it 
was, saying 2WJ and (S.) It is a prep., or 
particle governing a noun in the gen. case, (S, 
Mughnee, K,) and denotes the end, as opposed to 


[Of, which denotes] the beginning, of an extent, 
or of the space between two points or limits; (S, 
M;) or the end of an extent (T, Mughnee, K) of 
place; [signifying To, or as far as;] as in the 
phrase [in the Kur xvii. 1], JJ p JJI '■> JA I of 
. vjrt l [From the Sacred Mosque to, or as 
far as, the Furthest Mosque; meaning from the 
mosque of Mekkeh to that of Jerusalem]; 
(Mughnee, K;) or in the saying, JJ Jjl Of ‘■J- J 
^ [I went forth from El-Koofeh to Mekkeh], 
which may mean that you entered it, [namely, the 
latter place,] or that you reached it without 
entering it, for the end includes the beginning of 
the limit and the furthest part thereof, but does 
not extend beyond it. (S.) [In some respects it 
agrees with Jj q. v. And sometimes it signifies 
Towards; as in Jj J=j He looked towards me; 
and jl u”- He, or it, inclined towards him, or it. 
— — It also denotes the end of a space of 
time; [signifying To, till, or until;] as in the saying 
[in the Kur ii. 183], Jj Jj jjJI I p [Then 
complets ye the fasting to, or till, or until, the 
night]. (Mughnee, K.) [Hence, J Ji (followed by 
a mansoob aor.) Till, or until: and J* Jj Till, or 
until, what time, or when? i. e. how long? and 
also to, till, or until, the time when. See also 

the last sentence in this paragraph.] [In like 

manner it is used in the phrases jj J!, 
and »ji JJ, meaning, (And so on,) to 
other things, and to the end thereof; equivalent 
to et coetera.]— — Sometimes, (S,) it occurs in 
the sense of ji, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) when a 
thing is joined to another thing; (Mughnee, K;) as 
in the phrase [in the Kur iii. 45 and lxi. 14], O i 
jl Jl yj— J [Who will be my aiders with, or in 
addition to, God?], (S, Mughnee, K,) accord, to 
the Koofees and some of the Basrees; (Mughnee;) 
i. e. who will be joined to God in aiding me? (M, 
TA;) and as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 
2], jl Ji J] jl JI I jKIj Vj [And devour not ye 
their possessions with, or in addition to, your 
possessions]; (T, S;) and [in the same, ii. 13,] lijj 
jj 3 JJ [And when they are alone with 
their devils]; (S;) and in the saying, jill JJ jill 
til [A few she-camels with, or added to, a few 
she-camels are a herd of camels], (S, Mughnee, 
K,) a prov., meaning (assumed tropical:) a little 
with a little makes much; (S and A in art. ? q. 
v.;) though one may not say, JJ 

Jli meaning Jli ji j: (Mughnee:) so too in the 
saying, Jj ji JJ jj. jli [Such a one is 
clement, or forbearing, with good education, 
or polite accomplishments, and intelligence, or 
knowledge of the law]; (M, TA-) and so, accord, 
to Kh, in the phrase, jj illl -iJi [1 praise 
God with thee: but see another rendering of this 


phrase below]. (ISh.) In the saying in the Kur [v. 
8], Jl JJI J! ppppj p* jP j I Jjj it is disputed 
whether [the meaning be Then wash ye your 
faces, and your arms with the elbows, or, and 
your arms as far as the elbows; i. e., whether] the 
elbows be meant to be included among the parts 
to be washed, or excluded therefrom. (T.) A 
context sometimes shows that what follows it is 
included in what precedes it; as in Of J JJI cji J 
?jl JJ Jjl [I read, or recited, the Kuran, from 
the beginning thereof to the end thereof]: or that 
it is excluded; as in JJ j' jJI I JJI p 
JJ 1 [explained above]: when this is not the case, 
some say that it is included if it be of the same 
kind [as that which precedes]; some, that it is 
included absolutely; and some, that it is excluded 
absolutely; and this is the right assertion; for 
with the context it is in most instances excluded. 
(Mughnee.) — — It is also used to show 
the grammatical agency of the noun governed by 
it, after a verb of wonder; or after a noun of 
excess importing love or hatred; [as in ji A 
JJ How lovely, or pleasing, is he to me! (TA in 
art. Mj and JJ Aiji U How hateful, or odious, 
is he to me! (S in art. Jj) and] as in the saying 
[in the Kur xii. 33], J! ji jUl m j [O my Lord, 
the prison is more pleasing to me]. (Mughnee, 
K.) [This usage is similar to that explained in the 
next sentence.] — — It is syn. with (S, 
M, Mughnee, Msb, K;) as in the phrase, J-J>i j 
IJS Of J! [It is more desirable, or pleasant, in my 
estimation than such a thing]; (Msb;) and in the 
saying of the poet, J-JJ » Jj JJJI JJ Jj V 
J-JUl Je- J 1 Of JJ [Is there no way of return to 
youth, seeing that the remembrance thereof is 
more pleasant to me, or in my estimation, than 
mellow wine?] (Mughnee, K:) and accord, to this 
usage of JJ in the sense of j ma y be explained 
the saying, JJ J'J ciiji ; meaning Thou art 
divorced at the commencement of a year. (Msb.) 

It is also syn. with J; as in the phrase, JVIj 

[And command, or to command, belongeth 
unto Thee, meaning God, as in the Kur xiii. 30, 
and xxx. 3], (Mughnee, K,) in a trad, respecting 
supplication: (TA:) or, as some say, it is here used 
in the manner first explained above, meaning, is 
ultimately referrible to Thee: and they say, 

^1 Alb, meaning, I tell the praise of God unto 
thee: (Mughnee:) [but see another rendering of 
this last phrase above:] you say also, JP! j That 
is committed to thee, or to thy arbitration. (Har 

p. 329.) It also occurs as syn. with J^; as in 

the saying in the Kur [xvii. 4], J? J! 

[And we decreed against the children of Israel]: 
(Msb:) or this means and we revealed to the 
children of Israel (Bd, Jel) decisively. (Bd.)

the saying [in the Kur iv. 89 and vi.12], 4! 

44 ej^ [He will assuredly collect you together 
on the day of resurrection]: (K:) thus it may be

jli jl^l 4^“ u*4 4! 4^ [Then do not thou 
leave me with threatening, as though I were,

a mangy camel]; (M, Mughnee;) or, accord, to 
some, there is an ellipsis and inversion in this 
verse; 4 1 being here in dependence upon a 
word suppressed, and the meaning being, 
smeared with pitch, [like a camel,] yet being 
united to men: or, accord, to Ibn-’Osfoor, 4^“ is 
here considered as made to import the meaning 
of rendered hateful, or odious; for he says that 
if 4 1 were correctly used in the sense of 4, it 
it would be allowable to say, 3ijill 44 j: 
(Mughnee:) [or the meaning may be, as though I 
were, compared to men, a mangy camel, smeared 
with pitch: for] I'Ab said, after mentioning 
'Alee, j4*3JI 4 SjtjillS 4! meaning My

thyself from infidelity?] because it imports the 

meaning of invitation. (TA.) It is also used 

[in a manner contr. to its primitive application, i.

syn. with 4; as in the saying [of a poet], iaj J4

as jj-, (M,) indecl., with a kesreh for its 
termination; (S;) [These and those,] a pi. having 
no proper sing., (S, K,) or a noun denoting a pi., 
(M,) or its sing, is K for the masc. and for 
the fem., (S, K,) for it is both masc. and fem., (S,) 
and is applied to rational beings and to irrational 
things. (M.) [Thus,] ls j ^ J=- *V j A, in the Kur 
xx. 86, means [They are these, following near 
after me; or] they are near me, coming near after 
me. (Jel, and Bd says the like.) And in the same, 
iii. 115, £j jjj V j Jj ?V J fjjlli Now ye, O ye 
these believers, love them, and they love not you. 

(Jel.) The particle (M) 1 * (S, K) used as an 

inceptive to give notice of what is about to be said 
is prefixed to it, [i. e., to the form with the 
lengthened I,] (S, M, K,) so that you say, J, ?V j* 
[meaning These, like as I j means “this”]. (S, K.) 
And AZ says that some of the Arabs say, ?V j. 

j [These are thy people], (S, M, *) and J, jlj 
jVj* [I saw these], (M,) with tenween and kesr 
(S, M) to the hemzeh; (S;) and this, says IJ, is of 

the dial, of Benoo-'Okeyl. (M.) And the j of 

allocution is added to it, so that you say, jjlj, 
[or j)V J, which is the same, and fSA! J, or fj V J, 
&c.,] and jV jt, (S, K,) and jV J, (so in some 
copies of the S and in the K,) or « 2 UVl, (so in some 
copies of the S and in the M,) in which the 
[second] J is augmentative, (M,) and J. jVI, 
with teshdeed, (K,) [all meaning Those, like as jl j 
and jJj mean “that” and hence] Ks says that 
when one says jjV J, the sing, is jj> and when 
one says jV J, the sing, is jj (S;) or jVI 
[or jl, each with an augmentative J, like ji, 
(and this, I doubt not, is the correct statement,)] 
is as though it were pi. of ji: (M:) but one does 
not say jV jli, or jV jA, (M,) [nor jV>, or the 
like.] [Thus it is said in the Kur ii. 4, <_ J^ jV jl 
u j^'^' I A jVjj jjj 0? Those follow a right 
direction from their Lord, and those are they who 
shall prosper.] And sometimes jV jl is applied to 
irrational things, as in the phrase j'il jV J j 1 
[After those days]; and in the Kur [xvii. 38], 
where it is said, jV J <3 il Jll j jj I j jijl u] 

Vjj“> j [Verily the ears and the eyes and the 

heart, all of those shall be inquired of]. (S.) 

The dims, are j A) and J, ji (S, M) and J, JjA: 
(M:) for the formation of the dim. of a noun of 
vague application does not alter 
its commencement, but leaves it in its original 
state, with fet-h or damm, [as the case may be,] 
and the ls which is the characteristic of the 
dim. is inserted in the second place if the word is 
one of two letters, [as in the instance of A, dim. 
of I j,] and in the third place if it is a word of three 
letters. (S.) — JVI, (as in some copies of the S 
and T,) of the same measure as JJl; (S; 


[wherefore the author of the TA prefers this 
mode of writing it, which expresses the manner 
in which it is always pronounced;]) or VVI; (ISd, 
TA;) or JjVI; (so in some copies of the S and T;) 
is likewise a pi. having no proper sing., [meaning 
They who, those which, and simply who, and 
which,] its sing, being ls j; (S;) or is changed 
from being a noun of indication so as to have the 
meaning of jj; as also j ?VVI; wherefore they 
have the lengthened as well as the shortened alif, 
and that with the lengthened alif is made indecl. 
by terminating with a kesreh. (ISd.) A poet 
says, ^l_>jl Ijjlas Ij^ulj Jl (j* l ifal lj JjVI (jl j 
j j' [And they who are in Et-Taff, of the family 
of Hashim, shared their property, one with 
another, and so set the example, to the generous, 
of the sharing of property]. (T, and S in art. 
where, in one copy, I find JVI in the place 
of J jVI.) And another poet says, jijij ?Vyi u Jj 
AJ> [And verily they who know thee, of them]: 
which shows what has been said above, 
respecting the change of meaning. (ISd.) Ziyad 
El-Aajam uses the former of the two words 
without Jl, saying, Jill j Jill J jl jli 

jilL ’Ji. Ii* j [For ye are they who came 

with the herbs, or leguminous plants, and 
the young locusts, and they have gone away, 
while these, yourselves, are not going away]: (T:) 
he means that their nobility is recent. (Ham p. 
678; where, instead of ji and J. jl, we find jl j 
and VI.) In the phrase J jVI Jjll, (as in the 

L, and in some copies of the S and K,) or JVI, (as 
also in the L, and in other copies of the S and K, 
[and thus it is always pronounced,]) J jVI or JVI 
may also signify Jill, the verb IjJl being 
suppressed after it, because understood; [so that 
the meaning is. The Arabs who have preceded, or 
passed away;] so says Ibn-EshShejeree: (L:) or it 
is formed by transposition from JjVI, being 
pi. of J jl [fem. of Jjl], like as jj is pi. of J: and 
it is thus in the phrase, J jVI m jll Jji or JVI 
[The first Arabs have passed away]. (S, K.) 
'Obeyd Ibn-ElAbras uses the phrase, JVI jj [as 
meaning We are the first]. (TA.) JJ: see Jl. J): 
see JJ: — and see also art. Jl. Jl (T, S, M, K) and 
J, Ji, (S, M, K,) the latter said by Zekereeya to be 
the most common, and the same is implied in the 
S, but MF says that this is not known, (TA,) and 
i jj, (T,) or l ji, (Es-Semeen, K,) like Ji, (Es-

benefaction, favour, boon, or blessing: pi. (Vi. (T,

as in the S, [but in a copy of the S, and in one of 
the T, written without teshdeed,] a form asserted 
to be correct by some, but it is rarer and lower 
than JJ, though it is the form commonly 
obtaining with the vulgar: (TA:) the dual, is 
J, ujl, (AZ, T, S,) without ji; (S;) but jjl 
sometimes occurs: (IB:) JjVI JJi is an epithet 
applied to the Zenjee, (K in art. uj) meaning

K;) or is used in a case of interrogation, (S, Msb,) 
corresponding to the interrogative ', 
and meaning ls\ (S,) or, as Z says, iJilh'l' 1 ls'; 
[for an explanation of which, see what follows;] 
(Mughnee;) or, [in other words,] 
corresponding to the interrogative ', whereby, 
and by fl, one seeks, or desires, particularization: 
(Mughnee:) it is as though it were an 
interrogative after an interrogative. (Lth, T.) 
Thus you say, jlall J P P [Is Zeyd in the 

house, or 'Amr?]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which of 
them two 0-4! 1) is in the house? (S;) therefore 
what follows j»l and what precedes it compose one 
sentence; and it is not used in commanding 
nor in forbidding; and what follows it must 
correspond to what precedes it in the quality of 
noun and of verb; so that you say, P P 

+•'-3 [Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?] and p Pj ^31 
- 1 * 5 [Did Zeyd stand, or sit?]. (Msb.) It is not to be 
coupled with I after it: you may not say, P j ■iliti 
p, (s.) — — As connected in like 
manner with what goes before, it is preceded by I 
denoting equality [by occurring after PjL, &c.], 
and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur lxiii. 
6,] jiillu 4 pp Ci jiilLi ppPc. iijL [it will he 
equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for 
them or do not beg forgiveness for them]. 
(Mughnee.) — — It is also unconnected with 
what precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying 
always digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an 
enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, 
Mughnee,) other than i, (Mughnee,) or by I 
not meant [really] as an interrogative but to 
denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies lS, 
(Lth, Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or i p and ' 
together, (Msb,) and this is its meaning always 
accord, to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny 
this. (Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an 
enunciative, you say, &S 4 44 [Verily they are 

camels: nay, or nay but, they are sheep, or goats: 
or nay, are they sheep, or goats?]: (S 

Msb, Mughnee:) this being said when one looks 
at a bodily form, and imagines it to he a number 
of camels, and says what first occurs to him; then 



[BOOKI.]

the opinion that it is a number of sheep or goats 
suggests itself to him, and he turns from the first 
idea, and says, £1, meaning 3), because it is a 
digression from what precedes it; though what 
follows J; is [properly] a thing known certainly, 
and what follows 3 is opined. (S, TA.) And using 
it after an interrogative in this case, you say, 3* 
jjic 3 jlkii jjj [is Zeyd going away? Nay rather, 
or, or rather, is Amr?]: you digress from the 
question respecting Zeyd's going away, and make 
the question to relate to 'Amr; so that 3 implies 
indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and 
digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, 3* 
3 3* i j [Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather, or or 
rather, did 'Amr?]. (Msb.) And an ex. of the same 
is the saying [in the Kur xiii. 17], L $ jiLj 3* 

jjUlj cjUlkll 3* 3 j [Are the blind and 
the seeing equal? Or rather are darkness and 
light equal?]. (Mughnee.) And an ex. of it 
preceded by I used to denote disapproval is the 
saying [in the Kur vii. 194], 3 1«* 0 jl** 34 ji fill 

0.3*14; 41 [Have they feet, to walk therewith? 
Or have they hands to assault therewith?]: for I is 
here equivalent to a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has 
been shown above that] f is sometimes 
introduced immediately before 3*: (S, K:) but 
IB says that this is when 3* occurs in a phrase 
next before it; [as in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, 
cited above;] and in this case, the interrogative 
meaning of 3 is annulled; it being introduced 

only to denote a digression. (TA.) It is also 

used as a simple interrogative; accord, to the 
assertion of AO; in the sense of 3*; (Mughnee;) 
or in the sense of the interrogative I; (Lth, T, K) 
as in the saying, * 1*3 113** 3, meaning Hast 
thou a morning-meal ready? a good form of 
speech used by the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable 

when preceded by another phrase. (T.) And 

sometimes it is redundant; (AZ, T, S, Mughnee, 
K) in the dial, of the people of El-Yemen; (T;) 
as in the saying, 03* 13 3) j j _ s 3** JS li 3 3*1 4 
UaSjj (T, S, * [in the latter, 3* 4, and only 
the former hemistich is given,]) meaning O 
Dahna, (the curtailed form 3*1 being used 
for *3*1,) my walking was not, as now in my age, 
[a feeble movement like] dancing: but in my 
youth, my manner of walking used to be a 
bounding: (T:) this is accord, to the opinion of 
AZ: but accord, to another opinion, 3 is 
here [virtually] conjoined with a preceding clause 
which is suppressed; as though the speaker had 
said, •lillS JS li fi iLaSj jlSi 3*1 3. (A 'Hat, 
TA.) — It is also used (T, Mughnee) in the dial, of 
the people of El-Yemen, (T,) or of Teiyi and 
Himyer, (Mughnee,) in the sense of 31, (T,) to 
render a noun determinate. (Mughnee.) So in the 


trad., 3*-=*! jjil 0-* 341, (T, Mughnee,) i.

Now fighting has become lawful; as related 
accord, to the dial, of Himyer, for (TA 

in art. ( ~*3=.) it has been said that this form 4 is 
only used in those cases in which the 3 of the

in the phrase, cvo**! **4 jl j £*jll *=■ [Take thou the

we have cited above. (Mughnee.) — 3

(Msb:) the pi. is **4*i (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K)

to human beings, and the latter to beasts; (T, S;) 
or the former to rational beings, and the latter to 
irrational; (M, K;) or the former is much applied 
to human beings, and the latter to others, for the 
sake of distinction; (Msb;) but the reverse is 
sometimes the case: (IB:) IDrst and others hold 
the latter to be of weak authority: (TA:) the dim.

Arabs; but correctly, [accord, to those who hold

form of the dim. written <«3.]) 111 fl denotes 

dispraise; (S;) being used by the Arabs as 
meaning Thou hast no free, or ingenuous, 
mother; because the sons of female slaves are 
objects of dispraise with the Arabs; and is only 
said in anger and reviling: (A Heyth, T:) or, as 
some say, it means thou art one who has been 
picked up as a foundling, having no Known 
mother: (TA:) [or] it is also sometimes used in 
praise; (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K;) and is used as an 
imprecation without the desire of its 
being fulfilled upon the person addressed, being 
said in vehemence of love; [lit. meaning mayest 
thou have no mother!], like 31ii and 311 Ul V, 

[and <111 3lM] &c. (Har p. 165.) Some elide 

the I of 3; as in the saying of 'Adee Ibn— Zeyd. 43

presence the mother of Zeyd]; meaning, 3 lS***- 
fjj; the ls of being also elided on account of 


the occurrence of two quiescent letters [after the 
elision of the I of 3]: (Lth, T, S:) and as in 
the phrase <14 j, (S,) which means <1V 3j j. (S, and 

K in art. 3;j, q. v.) 3llii Ua, means They two 

are thy two parents: or thy mother and 
thy maternal aunt. (K.) [But] <**4 ilia is said to 
mean [He expressed a wish that he (another)

his grandmother. (TA.) One says also, V 

3*3 4 l J** 5 [O my mother, do not thou such a 
thing], and [in like manner] 3*11 3*3 4; making 
the sign of the fern, gender a substitute for the 
[pronominal] affix ls ; and in a case of pause, you 

say <*i I*, (s.) And one says, <-*ij l*, 

and <li3j U ; meaning [What relationship

superfluous. (S.) 3 also relates to inanimate

K,) of a thing, (S, Msb, [in the former of which, 
this is the first of the meanings assigned to

thereto are collected together, or adjoined: (Lth, 
T:) the main, or chief, part of a thing; the main 
body thereof: and that which is a compriser, or

the place of collection, comprisal, or 
comprehension, of a thing; the place of 
combination thereof. (En-Nadr, T.) — — 

And hence, (IDrd, M,) The head, or chief, of a 
people, or company of men; (IDrd, S, M, K;) 
because others collect themselves together to 
him: (IDrd, TA:) so in the phrase 34** 3 [lit. the

and sometimes mase.: (M, K:) or it is mase., and 
sometimes fem. as meaning the %?•: or, as Zj 
says, they differ as to making it mase. and 
making it fem. (Msb.) You say, A_«Ui CiiS 1 was 
before him, in respect of place. (S.) In the saying 
of Mohammad, to Usameh, ^'-ii » 5 C^ 1 I, the 
meaning is The time of prayer [is before thee], or 
the place thereof; and by the prayer is meant the 
prayer of sunset. (Mgh.) You also say, ^lAil [i. 
c. Look before thee; meaning beware thou; or 
take thou note;] when you caution another, (M, 
K,) or notify him, of a thing. (M.) p-°l A 
person, (S, Mgh,) or learned man, (Msb,) whose 
example is followed, or who is imitated; (S, Mgh, 
Msb;) any exemplar, or object of imitation, (T, 
M, K,) to a people, or company of men, (T,) such 
as a head, chief, or leader, or some other person, 
(M, K,) whether they be following the right way 
or be erring therefrom: (T:) applied alike to a 
male and to a female: (Mgh, Msb:) applied to a 
female, it occurs in a phrase in which it is written 
by some with »: (Mgh:) but this is said to be a 
mistake: (Msb:) it is correctly without », because 
it is a subst., not an epithet: (Mgh, Msb:) or it is 
allowable with », because it implies the meaning 
of an epithet: (Msb:) and J, Ail signifies the same: 
(T, M, K:) the pi. of the former is Aij, (T, S, M, K, 
[but omitted in the CK,]) originally A»Jl, (T, S,) of 
the measure aUs', like Aliil, pi. of Jli*, (T,) but as 
two meems come together, the former is 
incorporated into the latter, and its vowel is 
transferred to the hemzeh before it, 
which hemzeh, being thus pronounced with kesr, 
is changed into ls; (T, S; *) or it is thus changed 
because difficult to pronounce; (M;) or, as Akh 
says, because it is with kesr and is preceded by 
another hemzeh with fet-h: (S:) but some 
pronounce it Aijl, (Akh, T, S, M, K,) namely, those 
who hold that two hemzehs may occur together; 
(Akh, S;) the Koofees reading it thus in the Kur 
ix. 12; (M;) but this is anomalous: (M, K:) it 
is mentioned as on the authority of Aboo-Is-hak, 
and [Az says,] I do not say that it is not allowable, 
but the former is the preferable: (T:) or the pi. 
is aJuI, originally A>JI like Aliii: one of the two 
meems being incorporated into the other after 
the transfer of its vowel to the hemzeh [next 
before it]; some of the readers of the Kur 
pronouncing the [said] hemzeh with its true 


sound; some softening it, agreeably with analogy, 
in the manner termed Lai uS; and some of the 
grammarians changing it into cs; but some of 
them reckon this incorrect, saying that there is no 
analogical reason for it: (Msb:) and accord, to 
some, (M,) its pi. is also f'-«l, (M, K,) like the sing., 
(K,) occurring in the Kur xxv. 74; (M;) not of the 
same category as Ja^ (M, K) and j, 
(M,) because they sometimes said but a 

broken pi.: (M, K: *) or, accord, to A 'Obeyd, it is 
in this instance a sing, denoting a pi.: (M, S: *) or 
it is pi. of fi, [which is originally f-«S,] like as 
is pi. of J (M:) the dim. of a^j! is J. or, 
as El-Mazinee says, \ Aii:i. (S.) — — fbAM also 
signifies The Prophet: (K:) he is called [the 
exemplar, object of imitation, leader, or head, of 
his nation, or people]; (T;) or iiVI fUl [the 
exemplar, &c., of the nation, or people]; (M;) it 
being incumbent on all to imitate his rule of life 

or conduct. (T.) The Khaleefeh: (Msb, K:) he 

is called ajcjII [the exemplar, &c., of the 

people, or subjects]. (M.) The title of I is still 
applied to the Kings of El-Yemen: Aboo-Bekr 
says, you say, fj^l fLil jiU, meaning such a one is 
the first in authority over the people, or company 
of men: and ujjl^all means the head, chief, 

or leader, of the Muslims. (TA.) The person 

whose example is followed, or who is imitated, [i. 
e. the leader,] in prayer. (Msb.) — — [The 
leading authority, or head, of a persuasion, or 
sect. The four AiJ or Aiji are the heads of the four 
principal persuasions, or sects, of the Sunnees; 
namely, the Hanafees, Shafi’ees, Malikees,

chief doctors of their persuasion, after Aboo- 
Haneefeh, namely, Aboo-Yoosuf and 
Mohammad, gliliVI The two Imams.]— — The 

leader of an army. (M, K.) The guide: (K:) 

he is called JAM fUl [the leader of the

behind them, because he guides them. (M.) 

The manager, or conductor, and right disposer, 

orderer, or rectifier, of anything. (M, K. *) 

The Kur-an (M, K) is called a!")' 1 1 "" jty [the guide

thus properly meaning Gentile: whence, in a

revealed scripture; (Bd in iii. 19 and 69;) so 
applied by those having a revealed scripture: (Bd

69, and Bd and Jel in lxii. 2:) [or] in the proper 
language [of the Arabs], of, or belonging to, or 
relating to, the nation (34) of the Arabs, who did 
not write nor read: and therefore metaphorically 
applied to (tropical:) any one not knowing the art 
of writing nor that of reading: (Mgh:) or 
(assumed tropical:) one who does not write; (T, 
M, K;) because the art of writing is acquired; as 
though he were thus called in relation to the 
condition in which his mother (34) brought him 
forth: (T:) or (assumed tropical:) one who is in 
the natural condition of the nation (341) to 
which he belongs, (Zj, * T, M, * K, *) in respect of 
not writing, (T,) or not having learned writing; 
thus remaining in his natural state: (M, K:) or 
(assumed tropical:) one who does not write well; 
said to be a rel. n. from 4; because the art of 
writing is acquired, and such a person is as 
his mother brought him forth, in respect of 
ignorance of that art; or, as some say, from 341 
because most of the Arabs were of 
this description: (Msb:) the art of writing was 
known among the Arabs [in the time of 
Mohammad] by the people of Et-Taif, who 
learned it from a man of the people of El-Heereh, 
and these had it from the people of El- 
Ambar. (T.) 0.44 V u/4, 4411- in the Kur ii. 73, 
means Vulgar persons, [or heathen,] who know 
not the Book of the Law revealed to Moses: 
(Jel:) or ignorant persons, who know not writing, 
so that they may read that book; or, who know 
not the Book of the Law revealed to Moses. 
(Bd.) Mohammad was termed (41 [meaning A 
Gentile, as distinguished from an Israelite: or, 
accord, to most of his followers, meaning 
illiterate;] because the nation (34) of the Arabs 
did not write, nor read writing; and [they say 
that] God sent him as an apostle when he did not 
write, nor read from a book; and this natural 
condition of his was one of his miraculous signs, 
to which reference is made in the Kur [xxix. 
47], where it is said, “thou didst not read, before 
it, from a book, nor didst thou write it with thy 
right hand:” (T, TA:) but accord, to the more 
correct opinion, he was not well acquainted with 
written characters nor with poetry, but he 
discriminated between good and bad poetry: 
or, as some assert, he became acquainted with 
writing after he had been unacquainted 
therewith, on account of the expression “ before 
it ” in the verse of the Kur mentioned above: or, 
as some say, this may mean that he wrote though 
ignorant of the art of writing, like as some of 
the kings, being u/4, write their signs, or marks: 


(TA:) or, accord, to Jaafar Es-Sadik, he used to 
read from the book, or scripture, if he did not 
write. (Kull p. 73.) [Some judicious observations 
on this word are comprised in Dr. Sprenger's Life 
of Mohammad (pp. 101-2); a work which, in the 
portion already published (Part I.), contains 

much very valuable information.] Also, (K,)

some, but others say that this is pi. of 44 [q.

the Arabs say, (IB, Msb,) because it implies the 
meaning of a pass. part, n., originally; (Msb;) but 
'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this is a mistake; for 
the latter word is an epithet applied to the part 
called 4 when it is broken; (IB;) or 34 3Li 
and J, 3* j*l*; (M, Mgh, K;) A wound by which the 
head is broken, (S, M, Msb, K,) reaching to the 
part called 4, (S, Msb,) or, [which means 
the same,] u*ijll fi, (M, K,) so that there 
remains between it and the brain [only] a thin 
skin: (S:) it is the most severe of ^4** [except 
that which reaches the brain (see 344)]: iSk says 
that the person suffering from it roars, or 
bellows, (3PP,) like thunder, and like the 
braying of camels, and is unable to go forth into 
the sun: (Msb:) the mulct for it is one third of the 
whole price of blood: (TA:) IAar assigns the 
meaning of [this kind of] 34i to J, 34; which 
seems, therefore, to be either a dial. var. or a 
contraction of 34 : (Msb:) the pi. of 34 is 4/

proper sing.: (M, TA:) the pi. of ( 4 4U is c*U 4U.

Also A camel having his hump bruised internally

an object of imitation. (Msb.) *9 pass. 

part. n. of the same; Followed as an example; 
imitated; &c.: thus distinguished from the former 
by the preposition with the object of its 
government. (Msb.) Pi-*: see -Ul. Ui Ul, used to 
denote an interrogation, is a compound of the 
interrogative hemzeh and the negative U : (M:) it 
is a mere interrogative [respecting a negative, 
like Vi]; as in the saying, <UI Ui [Art not 

thou ashamed for thyself, or of thyself, 

with respect to God?]. (Lth, T.) [IHsh says, 

after explaining two other usages of Ui which we 
have yet to mention,] El-Malakee adds a third 
meaning of Ul, saying that it is a particle 
denoting [or the asking, or requiring, a 

thing in a gentle manner], like [VI (q. v.) and] V j3; 
and is connected peculiarly with a verb; as in '■•I 
[Wherefore wilt not thou do stand?], and Ul 
[Wherefore wilt not thou do such a thing?]; 
which may be explained by saying that the 
hemzeh is used as an interrogative to make one 
confess, or acknowledge, a thing, as it is in p 

and VI, and that 1* is a negative. (Mughnee.) 

It is also an inceptive word, used in the manner 
of Vi; (M:) followed by VI, it is syn. with Vi; (S:) 
[meaning Now: or now surely: or] both of 
these meaning verily, or truly; i. c. 1*^: and for 
this reason Sb allows one’s saying, <il Ul 

and >5lUU <11 '-•I [Verily, or truly, he is 

going away]; with kesr after the manner of ‘‘-j VI, 
and with fet-h after the manner of ‘U and Ua 

IjS jlS Ul <111 j is mentioned as meaning <111 j Ul 
[&c„ i. e. Verily, or truly, by God, such a thing did 
indeed happen]; the » being a substitute for the 
hemzeh: (M:) so too -dll j eyU* [or -dll j UU] : (Sgh 
and K in art. ur^:) it denotes the truth of 
the words which follow it; as when you say, u] Ui 
elate, I5ij, meaning Truly, or properly speaking, 
not tropically, Zeyd is intelligent; and U <111 j Ul 
Ij^ P j [Truly, &c., by God, Zeyd beat, or 
struck, Amr]: (S in art. >•!;) [in other words,] it 
corroborates an oath and a sentence; as in -dll j Ui 
UjU 3ic5 V iljl >31 Cj jjl [Verily, or now 


surely, by God, if I remain awake for thee a night, 
then will I indeed leave thee repenting] ; and P Ui 
<u 3lLc jV 311SU cult [Verily, or now surely, if I 
had known thy place of being, then had I 
unsettled thee, or removed thee, from it]; and Ui 
pji [Verily, or now surely, he is 

(emphatically) a generous man]: (T:) or it is an 
inceptive particle, used in the manner of VI; 
[meaning now: or now surely:] (Mughnee:) or 
a particle used to give notice of what is about to 
be said: only put before a proposition [as in exs. 
mentioned above]: (TA:) and often occurring 
before an oath [as in exs. mentioned above]: and 
sometimes its hemzeh is changed into » or £, 
before the oath; each with the I remaining; 
[written U» or Ut ; ] and with the I elided; 
[written f* or £ ;] or with the I elided, but without 
the substitution; [written fl;] and when u 1 occurs 
after Ul, it is with kesr, as it is after VI; and it also 
means [verily, or truly]: or dbJ [verily? or 
truly?]: accord, to different opinions: and in this 
case, u 1 after it is with fet-h, as it is after 
accord, to Ibn-Kharoof, this is a particle: but 
some say that it is a noun in the sense of and 
others, that it consists of two words, namely, the 
interrogative hemzeh and U as a noun in 
the sense of i. e. i^Ull ^Ul [is that thing 
ture?]; so that the meaning is dai.l : [if S o, ul Ul 
means Verily, or truly, is he going away?] 
and this, which is what Sb says, is the correct 
opinion: U is virtually in the accus. case, as an 
adverbial noun, like as UU is literally: and u 1 with 
its complement is an inchoative, of which 
the adverbial noun is the enunciative: but Mbr 
says that U*. is the inf. n. of i>?5, which is 
suppressed, and that u 1 with its complement is 
an agent. (Mughnee.) Ul is a conditional and 
partitive and corroborative particle; and is 
sometimes written Ujl, by the change of the 

first f> into i$. (Mughnee, K.) It is used as a 

conditional particle in the words of the Kur 
[ii.24], ^511 Ulj iy* J^Ull <jl {j jULb I^jUI ^jj51l Ula 
5lii 15$^ <lll 51 jl 15 U IjjiS [For as for those 

who have believed, they know that it is the truth 
from their Lord; but as for those who have 
disbelieved, they say, What is it that God 
meaneth by this as a parable?]. (Mughnee,* K,* 
TA.) That it denotes a condition is shown by the 
necessary occurrence of ‘-i after it; for if this 
were a conjunction, it would not be prefixed to 
the enunciative; and if it were redundant, it 
might be dispensed with; but it may not be 
dispensed with except in a case of necessity in 

poetry or in a case of an ellipsis. In most 

cases, (Mughnee, K,) it is used as a partitive, 
(S, Mughnee, K,) implying the meaning of a 


condition; (S; [in which it is mentioned with Ul;]) 
and thus it is used in the passage of the Kur cited 
above; (Mughnee;) and in the following exs. [in 
the Kur xviii. 78 and 79 and 81], ccUs <LiLill Ul 
j3jil ^ _y.7'.--U: and Hj5l jtUll Ul j 

and uPpA JSi jl5all Ul j [As for the ship, it 

belonged to poor men who worked on the sea . . . 
and as for the boy, his two parents were believers 
. . . and as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan 
boys]. (Mughnee, * K, * TA.) [It is a partitive also 

in the phrase -U5UI, which see in art. a*<] 

Few have mentioned its use as a corroborative: 
(Mughnee:) it is thus used in the phrase Ul 
5_i4l5a jjj [Whatever be the case, or happen what 
will or what may, or at all events, Zeyd is going 
away], when you mean that Zeyd is inevitably 
going away, and determined, or decided, upon 
doing so: (Z cited in the Mughnee, and K:) 
therefore Sb explains it as meaning, in this 
case, O? i5& U«-» [whatever be the case, & c., 
as above, or, in some instances, happen what 
would or what might]; thereby showing it to be 
a corroborative, and to have a conditional 
meaning: (Z cited in the Mughnee: [and the same 
explanation of it is given, with a similar ex., in the 
S, in art. j^l:]) the in this case, is transferred 
from its proper place before the inchoative, and 
put before the enunciative. (I 'AK p. 306.) Ks says 
that Ui is used in commanding and forbidding 
and announcing: you say, 5Sc.la <111 Ui [Whatever 
be the case, or happen what will, & c., God 
worship thou]: and iU jiill Ui [i. e. jiill Ui 
tjj 51a ( a s is shown in the case of a similar ex. 
in the Mughnee, though you may say ^ jiill Ul 
without an ellipsis, like as you say Ui 
f*U5$i as well as ijiS Ui, J n the Kur xli. 16, accord, 
to different readers,) Whatever be the case, &c., 
wine (drink not), drink not thou it]: and P j Ul 
[Whatever be the case, &c., with respect to 
other things, Zeyd has gone forth; or whatever 
be the case with respect to others, as for Zeyd, he 
has gone forth]: whereas Ul [which see in the 
next paragraph] is used in expressing a condition 
and in expressing doubt and in giving option and 

in taking option. (T.) [IHsh says that in his 

opinion,] in the phrase j5a jjj» 1I Ul, thus 
heard, with 4“*ll in the accus. case, the 
meaning is, cjjS5 [&c., i. e. Whenever thou 
mentionest the slaves, he is a possessor of slaves: 
but I would rather say that the meaning 
is, 4y»ll >5ljS5 Ul, Sic., i. e. as for thy mentioning 
the slaves, &c.]: and so in similar phrases which 
have been heard. (Mughnee.) — Distinct 
from the foregoing is Ul in the saying in the Kur 
[xxvii. 86], <U£I5 Ui [Or rather, what is it 

that ye were doing?]: for here it is a compound of

the unconnected fl and the interrogative !■*

Khurasheh, because thou wast possessor of a

the u 1 termed [which combines with a 

verb following it to form an equivalent to an inf. 
n.] and the redundant Uiji Ui ;U i$ for UuS JV; the 
preposition and the verb are suppressed for the 
sake of abridgment, so that the pronoun [Ui 
in cuS] becomes separate; and U 
substituted for the verb [thus deprived of its 
affixed pronoun], and the u [of (jl] is 
incorporated into the f [of U], (Mughnee.) [See 
another reading of this verse voce UI; a nd there 
also, immediately after, another ex. (accord, to 
the Mughnee) of Ui used in the manner explained 
above. See also (jl as a conditional particle, 
like uj.] — Also i. q. UI, q. v . (Mughnee, K.) UI is 
sometimes written Ui, and sometimes its first ? 
is changed into lS, [forming Uji or Ujl or both, as 
will be shown below,] (Mughnee, [in my copy of 
which it is written Uji, and so in some copies of 
the K,] and K, [in some copies of which it is 
written UjJ,]) and it is held by Sb to be a 
compound of uj and U, (Mughnee,) or as 
denoting the complement of a condition it is a 
compound of uj and U. (m, K.) — — It denotes 
doubt; (Ks, T, Mughnee, K;) as in o* lS j^i U 
j jic Ui jU j Ui [i know not who stood: either Zeyd 
or 'Amr]: (Ks, T:) and jj Uc- Ulj Uj Ui 
[There came to me either Zeyd or 'Amr], 
said when one knows not which of them came. 

(Mughnee, K.) It also denotes vagueness of 

meaning; as in [the Kur ix. 107,] MjU Ui j UI 
[Either He will punish them or He will turn 

unto them with forgiveness]. (Mughnee, K.) 

It also denotes giving option; as in [the Kur xviii. 
85,] UUi. .iili jl UJj jl lUJ [Either do 
thou punish, or do thou what is good to them]. 

(Mughnee, K.) It also denotes the making a 

thing allowable; as in lj^ Ulj Ui 4*) [Learn 
thou either low or syntax; (an ex. given in the T, 
on the authority of Ks, as an instance of the usage 
of Ui to denote giving option;)] but its use with 
this intent is disputed by some, (Mughnee, K,) 

while they assert it of jl. (Mughnee.) It is 

also used as a partitive; as in [the Kur lxxvi. 3,] Ui 
IjjiS UI j IjSUS [Either, or whether, being 
thankful or being unthankful]; (Mughnee, K;) the 
two epithets being here in the accus. case as 
denotatives of state: or, accord, to the Koofees, UI 
may be here [a compound of] the conditional uj 
and the redundant uU ;U, accord, to Ibn- 
EshShejeree, being understood after it: 


(Mughnee:) and Fr says that the meaning is, uj 
ujj [if he be thankful and if he be 
unthankful]. (T.) — — It also denotes taking 
option; as in the saying, £ jU. Ufa <2 j£ll j jl j J 
jl Ulj jl Uli [1 have a house in El- 

Koofeh, and I am going forth to it, and either I 
will inhabit it or I will sell it: but this is similar to 

the usage first mentioned above]. (Ks, T.) It 

is a conjunction, (S in art. _>*l, and Mughnee,) 
accord, to most authorities, i. e., the second UI fo 
the like of the saying, Ulj Uj UI 

[mentioned above]; (Mughnee;) used in the 
manner of jl in all its cases except this one, that 
in the use of jl you begin with assurance, and 
then doubt comes upon you; whereas you begin 
with UI fo doubt, and must repeat it; as in the 
saying last mentioned: (S: [and the like is said in 
the Mughnee, after the explanations of the 
meanings:]) but some assert that it is like the 
first UI, not a conjunction; because it is generally 
preceded by the conjunction j: and some 
assert that UI conjoins the noun with the noun, 
and the j conjoins UI with UI; but the conjoining 
of a particle with a particle is strange. (Mughnee.) 

Sometimes the j is suppressed; as in the 

following verse, (Mughnee,) of El-Ahwas; (S;) 1) 
jU Jj UjI Jj UjI Ig.UlAj ; - jiii Lull [o, would 
that our mother took her departure, either 
to Paradise or Hell-fire!]; (S,* Mughnee, K;) cited 
by Ks, with UjI fo r Ul : (T:) and sometimes it is 
with kesr [i. e. Ui] : (S:) IB says that it is 
correctly UI, with kesr; asserting the original to 

be UI, with kesr, only. (TA.) And sometimes 

the former U is dispensed with; as in the 
following verse, (Mughnee,) which shows also 
that U is sometimes suppressed; u* ^Ijjl ■UiU 
UUj (jla i-ijji. 0-0 jl j ^ Vu-^ [The thundering clouds 
of summer-rain watered him, or of autumn-rain; 
so he will not want sufficient drink]: i. e. u* UI 
Cy Ulj yu-a. (Mughnee, K.) Mbr and As say 
that (jl is here conditional, and that the —*> is its 
complement: but this assertion is of no weight; 
for the object is the description of a mountain- 
goat as having sufficient drink in every case: AO 
says that uj in this verse is redundant. 

(Mughnee.) Sometimes, also, one does not 

require to mention the second UI, by mentioning 
what supplies its place; as in the saying, j\ UI 
Vlj [Either do thou speak what is good 
or else be silent]. (Mughnee.) [See art. VI, near its 
end.] — Distinct from the foregoing is UI in the 
saying in the Kur [xix. 26], jUd jlUll u* u^j^Ula 
[And if thou see, of mankind, any one]: for this is 
[a compound of] the conditional uj and the 
redundant U. (s * in art. and Mughnee.) [In 
like manner,] you say, in expressing a 
condition, biic. jlL: jla 11 j (jiiii UI [if thou revile 


Zeyd, he will treat thee with forbearance]. (Ks, T.) 
And ■iUjO‘41 (^U1 j UI [if thou come to me, I 
will treat thee with honour]. (S.) — — In the 
following saying, Uallj l laiku cui UI [if thou be 
going away, I go away], the U i$ not that which 
restrains the particle to which it is subjoined 
from governing, but is a substitute for a verb; (K 
and TA in art. U ; ) as though the speaker said, bj 
lalkii Cij~a [or rather uj]. (TA in that art.) 
And hence the saying of the poet, [of which a 
reading different from that here following has 
been given voce Ui,] ^ ja jla jUu b Ciii UI 4UI ji. Ui 
jjUJI 4^ ^ [O Aboo-Khurasheh, if thou be 
possessor of a number of men, verily, my people, 
the year of dearth, or of sterility, hath 
not consumed them]; as though he said, I j cuS jl 
ji. (TA in that art.) [But IHsh states the case 
differently; saying,] An instance of etui UI 
ejaikil lalku no t used to restrain from governing, 
but as a substitute for a verb, occurs in the 
saying, ejaikil lilku Cui Ui [Because thou 
wast going away, I went away]; originally, ejalkil 
liiku UuS ,jj/ : [for an explanation of which, see 
what is said of etui UI fo a reading of the verse 
commencing with <UI ji- 1)1 voce Ui : ] but accord, 
to El-Farisee and IJ, the government belongs 
to U ; not to <jU [or Uu£], (Mughnee in art. U.) — 
— So too in the saying, VUI li* jliil, meaning d! 
i'Jjh UlS [(. e. Do thou this if thou wilt not 

do another thing; or do thou this at least]; 
(Mughnee and K, each in art. U ; ) indicating a 
person's refusal to do [fully] that which he is 
ordered to do: (TA in that art.:) or I^S j*ila VUI, 
meaning if thou wilt not do that, then do thou 
this; the three particles [uj and U and V] being 
made as one word: so says Lth: (T:) [J says,] VUI 
b£ is pronounced with imaleh, [i. e. “ imma- 
le,”] and is originally V u! with U as a connective; 
and the meaning is, if that thing will not be, then 
do thou thus: (S in art. V:) [but] AHat [disallows 
this pronunciation, and] says, sometimes 
the vulgar, in the place of VUI dh jliil, say, jW! 
lSj!) [Do thou that at least]; but this is Persian, 
and is rejected as wrong: and they say also, (4^, 
with damm to the I [and with imaleh in the case 
of the final vowel, and thus it is vulgarly 
pronounced in the present day]; but this too is 
wrong; for it is correctly VUI, [with kesr, and] 
not pronounced with imaleh, for particles [in 
general] are not thus pronounced: (T:) and the 
vulgar also convert the hemzeh into » with 
damm [saying j^lA*]. (TA in art. '-“.) [Fei says,] V 
is a substitute for the verb in the saying, jl*^ VU>I 
I)*, the meaning being If thou do not that, then 
[at least] do thou this: the origin thereof is this; 
that certain things are incumbent on a man to do, 
and he is required to do them, but refuses; and 



[BOOKI.]

then one is content with his doing some, or 
a part, of them, and says to him thus: i. e., if thou 
wilt not do all, then do thou this: then the verb is 
suppressed, on account of the frequency of the 
usage of the phrase, and 1 a is added to give force 
to the meaning: and some say that it is for this 
reason that V is here pronounced with imaleh; 
because it serves for the verb; like as Ja is, and 
the vocative 4: but it is said that it is correctly 
pronounced without imaleh; because particles [in 
general] are not pronounced therewith; as Az 
says. (Msb in art. V.) [El-Hareeree says that] Yli) 
is properly [a compound of] three particles, 
which are u] and 1 a and V, made as one word, and 
the I at the end thereof is like the I of <s jA [in 
which it is written lS, agreeably with rule]; 
wherefore it is pronounced with imaleh, like as is 
the I of this latter word. (Durrat el-Ghowwas, in 
De Sacy’s Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 57 of the Arabic text.) 
In the Lubab it is said that Y is used as a negative 
of the future, as in 3*4 Y; and the verb [in YlAI] is 
suppressed; so it [V] serves as a substitute in the 
saying, V'-*] 'a* J*i); therefore they pronounce 
its I with imaleh: and IAth says that the Arabs 
sometimes pronounced Y with a slight imaleh; 
and the vulgar make the imaleh thereof full, so 
that its I becomes ls; but this is wrong. (TA.) You 
say also, YU>| Ia* A meaning Take thou this if 
thou take not that. (T.) It is related that 
the Prophet saw a runaway camel, and said, “To 
whom belongeth this camel? ” when, lo, some 
young men of the Ansar said, “ We have drawn 
water upon him during twenty years, and yet he 
has in him fat; so we desired to slaughter him; 
but he escaped from us. ” He said, “Will ye sell 
him? ” They answered, “No: but he is thine. ” And 
he said, A' A4 A* -S*!! I YlAI, meaning If ye 

will not sell him, act well to him until his term of 
life come to him. (T.) 1 AIaI, (t, S, M, K,) 

aor. (T, M, K,) inf. N. (T, S, M,) He 
measured it; determined its measure, quantity, or 
the like; computed, or conjectured, its 
measure, quantity, &c.; (T, S, * M, K;) as also 
l (M, K,) inf. n. cAjAj. (TA.) You say, 4 ciuul 
ji J Compute thou, O such a one, this, 

for me, how many it is. (T.) And f j4l ‘■AiaI He 
computer, or conjectured, the number of the 
people, or company of men. (T.) And ilAll ciul He 
measured, or computed, the distance between 

him and the water. (T.) Also, (S, K,) aor. as 

above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (S,) i. q. [He 
tended, repaired, betook himself, or directed his 
course, to it, or towards it; aimed at it; sought 
after it; or intended, or purposed, it]; (S, K;) 

namely, a thing. (S.) 2 aAAI: see 1 . aaAI He 

was suspected of evil. (M, TA.) ‘■AiAIa measure of 


distance [&c.]; as in the saying, uS Ia ‘^4 caai ^ 
what is the measure of the distance 
between thee and El-Koofeh? (T, TA.) — Doubt: 
(Th, T, M:) said to be so termed because this 
word signifies the “ computing, or conjecturing, 
measure, quantity, and the like,” in which there is 
doubt. (T, TA.) [See 1 .] So in the following 
ex.: aaaI Y jAAJI wine is unlawful: there 

is no doubt respecting the unlawfulness of it: (Sh, 
Th, T, K:) or the meaning is, there is no 
indulgence, or lenity, with respect to it; from 
as signifying “feebleness, or weakness, ” in 
a journey, or pace. (T, TA.) And in the saying, 041 
Ciii jAAJI There is no doubt respecting wine, 
that it is unlawful. (Th, M.) [Or in the like of 
these two instances it signifies] Disagreement, or 
diversity of opinion, (L-iilikl,) respecting a thing 
(tO-A l 4). (M, K.) — Curvity, crookedness, 
distortion, or unevenness: (M, K:) ruggedness in 
one place and smoothness in another; (K;) 
[inequality of surface;] one part being higher, or 
more prominent, than another: (TA:) an elevated 
place: (T, S, K:) small mounds: (Fr, Th, T, S, M, 
K:) or what is elevated, of ground: or, as some 
say, water-courses of valleys, such as are low, 
or depressed: (Fr, T, TA:) small hills; hillocks: 
(M, TA:) a hollow, or depressed place, between 
any two elevated portions of ground &c.: (LAar, T, 
M:) depression and elevation, or lowness and 
highness, (S, M, A, K,) in the ground; (A;) used in 
this sense in the Kur xx. 106 ; (S;) and the same in 
a water-skin not completely filled: (S, A: *) or 
laxity in a water-skin when it is not well filled so 
as to overflow: (T, * TA:) or a [consequence of] 
pouring [water] into a skin until it doubles, 
or creases, and not filling it; so that one part of it 
is higher, or more prominent, than another: (M, 
TA:) pi. ‘AjIaI (M, K, TA, but in some copies of the 
K diUi ; and in the CK *AiO ; ) and cii ^Ai. (M, K.) You 
say, cAAi Ias i_A= 0YI ciijllal The earth, or ground, 
was even, so that there was not in it any 
depression and elevation. (A, TA.) And il4JI Yiil 
Ciii Ua The skin became full, so that there was 
not in it any depression [of one part of its 
surface] and elevation [of another part]. (S, A. *) 
Az says, (TA,) I have heard the Arabs say, Ya 4 
CiAi Y Ya aj jail He had filled the water-skin so 

full that there was no laxity in it. (T, TA.) A 

fault, a defect, an imperfection, a blemish, or the 
like, (T, M, K,) in the mouth, and in a garment, or 
piece of cloth, and in a stone. (M, K.) [Hence the 
saying,] ALa Y ^ ciiil i. e. [May there be 

a defect, or the like,] in stones; not in thee: 
meaning, may God preserve thee when the stones 
shall have perished: (Sb, M:) caJ is here put 
in the nom. case, though the phrase is significant 


of a prayer, because it is not a verbal word: the 
phrase is like ^ 4J Jill; and the commencing the 
sentence with an indeterminate noun is 
approvable because it is virtually a prayer. (M.) 
This prov. is mentioned by the expositors of the 
Tes-heel: not by Meyd. (TA.) — — Weakness; 
feebleness; (T, K;) langour; remissness. (TA.) You 
say, Ciii Y I jiu U We performed a journey, 
or went a pace, in which was no weakness, or 
feebleness [&c.]. (T, TA.) — A good way, course, 
mode, or manner, of acting, or conduct, or the 
like. (T, K.) cAAyi Suspected of evil and the like. 
(K.) [See 2 .] — [A water-skin] filled [so as to be

Zeyd to beat 'Amr, and he beat him, yet one also

Distinguished, or defined, (-^>,) by signs, or

The best of property are a prolific filly [and a row 
of palm-trees, or perhaps a tall palmtree, 
fecundated]; (AZ, A 'Obeyd, T, S, A, K;) as though 
the filly were commanded [by God] to be so: (A, 
in which the epithet » p>»k* thus used is said to be 
tropical:) [or] »p>«k« is thus for the sake 
of conformity to »pp;k« ; and is originally »p \*'y, (S, 
M, * K,) from Aill U p4 ; (TA:) or it is a dial. var. of 
weak authority; (K;) though, accord, to AZ, it 
signifies made to have abundant offspring, 
from »p$-4l “dll y\ meaning “God made the filly to 
have abundant offspring,” a dial. var. of 1* iy\ as 
A 'Obeyd also asserts it to be. (TA.) p4p and 
see what next follows, jyy [Obeying, or 

conforming to, a command; &c.: see 8. ] One 

who acts according to his own opinion; (T;) who

anomalous]. (M, K.) [See piA] j A4; (M, K;) so in

or, as some say, a small beast: (M:) and a kind of 
mountain-goat: (M, K:) or a certain wild beast, 
(K, TA,) or a beast resembling the mountain- 
goat, (M,) having a single branching horn in the 
middle of his head. (M, TA.) [See jyy., the 
oryx.] p“l p“l, meaning Yesterday, or the day 
before the present day (Msb, K) by one night, (K,) 


and tropically applied to (tropical:) what is 
before that, (Msb,) or a short time before, (Bd in 
x. 25,) [used as a subst. and as an adv.,] is indecl., 
with any of the three vowels for its 
termination: (K:) [written p“l and p“l and p“k] 
or it is an adv. n., indecl., with kesr for its 
termination, unless made indeterminate, or 
made determinate [be the article <J']; and 
sometimes indecl. with fet-h: (EzZejjajee, M, TA:) 
or, accord, to I Hsh, the termination with fet-h is 
a rejected form; and that with damm is not 
mentioned by any of the grammarians: (TA:) 
but p“l A [Since yesterday] occurs, used by 
poetic licence: (Sb, S:) p“i is a noun of which the 
last letter is made movent to avoid 
the concurrence of two quiescent letters: and the 
Arabs differ respecting it: (S:) most of them make 
it indecl., with kesr for its termination, when it is 
determinate [without the article Jl]: but some of 
them make it [imperfectly] deck when it is 
determinate [in the same manner]: (S, K: *) 
[accord, to the most approved usage,] you say, 
[p-41 <40, and p“V4, which is more common, 
and I saw him yesterday; and] <£1 j U 

[I have not seen him since yesterday]; and if you 
have not seen him [since the day next] before 
that, you say, Cy Jj' ^ j ki [1 have not 
seen him since the day before yesterday]; and if 
you have not seen him [since] two days before 
that, you say, Cy a? uj' <40 k« [1 have 
not seen him since the day before the day 
before yesterday]. (ISk, TA.) The phrase <40 
[I saw him yesterday] has also been heard, but it 
is extr. (K.) The people of El-Hijaz 
make p“i indecl., with kesr for its termination; 
and the Benoo-Temeem do the same when it is in 
the accus. or gen. case; but these latter make 
it [imperfectly] deck when it is in the nom. case, 
saying, <4 kP [Yesterday has gone with 

what happened during it]; whereas the people 
of El-Hijaz say, <4 kp Cjii, because it is [held 
by them to be] indecl. on account of its implying 
that it has the determinative article Jt 
[understood as prefixed to it], the kesreh being 
added to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent 
letters; while the Benoo-Temeem hold it to be, in 
the nom. case, a deviation from and 

therefore imperfectly deck, because of its being 
determinate, [and so resembling a proper name,] 
and its deviation from the original form, like 
in the like case: (IB, TA:) all of the Arabs, 
however, make it deck when the article Jt is 
prefixed to it, (S, K, *) and when it is 
made indeterminate, or is prefixed to another 
noun: (S:) they say, using it indeterminately, kK 
UPI jjUa jk [Every morrow becomes a

yesterday]; (S, * IB;) and making it determinate 
by the article J, they say, 19= 9 [The 

yesterday was good], (IB,) and 
[The blessed yesterday has past]; (S;) and 
prefixing it to another noun, 19= 9 99 9 [All 
of our yesterday was good], (IB,) and 99 
[Our yesterday has past]: (S:) [therefore,] in the 
following verse, 9=“- 99 9a <93 j 93 

<^9 u-991 CialS [And verily I stood to-day, 
and yesterday before it, at thy door until the sun 
was almost setting], (thus related by IAar in two 
different ways, p-**VI and i_>“*VI,) if we read p=9fl, 
the Jl is redundant, because it is implied in the 
word p9l; hut if we read i_>**9 the J is not 
implied in (9*1, and therefore is prefixed to make 
it determinate. (IJ, M.) The pi. is 9>! and u=9, 
(Zj, K,) both pis. of pauc., (Zj, TA,) and 9 9, (Zj, 
K, TA, [in the CK, incorrectly, 99,]) which is a 
pi. of mult. (Zj, TA.) There is no dim. form 
of i_9; like as there is none of 9 and 9.jUll 
and *-9 and 9 and 9“ and 9 and 1* and ^ and 
the names of the months and those of the days of 
the week, except 99Jt. (Sb, S.) 9*“!, contr. to 
analogy, (M, TA,) and 9“' [which is agreeable 
with analogy] is allowable, as related by Sgh on 
the authority of Fr, but the former is the more 
chaste, (TA,) Of, or relating to, or belonging to, 
yesterday. (M, TA.) 91 l 9*1, (t, S, M, &c.,) 
aor. 9, (T, S, M, Msb,) and 9', (so in the M 
accord, to the TT,) inf. n. 9, (T, S, M, &c.,) this 
being the inf. n. accord, to IJ, [as distinguished 
from 91 and 9J,] (M,) He hoped it; or hoped for 
it; syn. 90; (S, * M, * [see 9 below,] K;) 
meaning, what was good for him; (S;) as also 
| 9, (T, * M, K,) inf. n. 9-9 (S, T:) or 
he expected it; [or had a distant, or remote, 
expectation of it; for] it is mostly used in relation 
to that of which the occurrence, or coming 
to pass, is deemed remote; as in the saying of 
Zuheyr, 9-9 9= o' 90 [I hope, and have a 
distant expectation, that her love may approach]: 
he who has determined upon a journey to a 
distant town or country says, J [i have 

formed an expectation, or a distant expectation, 
of arriving]; but he does not say, cj»9= until he 
has become near thereto; for relates only to 
that of which the occurrence, or coming to pass, 
is [deemed] near: and <99 is between 9VI 
and for it is sometimes attended with fear 
that the thing expected may not come to pass, 
wherefore it is used in the sense of fear; and 
when the fear is strong, [lest the thing expected 
should not come to pass, it denotes distant 
expectation, and thus] it is used in the sense 
of 9VI; whence the usage in the verse of Zuheyr; 
but otherwise it is used in the sense of : 
(Msb:) or =9 jll signifies the expectation of 


benefit, or advantage, from some preceding cause 
or means: so says El-Harallee: or it is properly 
syn. with 9VI; and in common conventional 
language, means the clinging of the heart to the 
coming to pass of a future desired event: so says 
Ibn-El-Kemal: or, accord, to Er-Raghib, 

an opinion requiring the coming to pass of an 
event in which will be a cause of happiness: (TA:) 
and J. -91 > inf. n. 99, signifies he expected it 
much; and is more commonly used than the form 
without teshdeed. (Msb.) 2 91 see l, in two 
places. — 99 also signifies The inducing [one] 
to hope or expect. (KL.) 5 =^9^9 [He 
considered the thing, or studied it, or 
contemplated it, carefully, or attentively, with 
investigation;] he looked at the thing 

endeavouring to obtain a clear knowledge of it: 
(S:) or i. q. »j9; (Msb, TA;) i. e., (Msb,) he looked 
into the thing, considered it, examined it, or 
studied it, repeatedly, (Msb, TA,) in order to 
know it, or until he knew it, (Msb,) or in order to 
ascertain its real case: (TA:) or he looked 
intently, or hardly, at, or towards, the thing: 
(TA:) or 9= signifies he acted, or proceeded, 
deliberately, not hastily, syn. 912, (T, M,) or he 
paused, or waited, syn. <9=, (K,) in an affair, and 
in consideration; (M, K, TA;) he paused, and 
acted with deliberation. (TA.) 9= 9 [meaning 
It requires careful, or attentive, consideration, or 
simply it requires consideration,] is a phrase [of 
frequent occurrence in the larger lexicons &c., 
used to imply doubt, and also to insinuate 
politely that the words to which it relates are 
false, or wrong,] like 9 [q. v.]. (MF in 
art. 9i : see 9L 9|: see 9L 9 (T, S, M, 

Msb, K) and f 9o| (IJ, M, K) and J, 9, (K,) the

is the form commonly known, (TA,) Hope; 
syn. =9j ; (s, M, K:) or expectation; [or distant, 
or remote, expectation; being] mostly used in 
relation to that of which the occurrence, 
or coming to pass, is deemed remote: applied 
also to an affection of the heart from some good 
to be attained: (Msb, TA: [in both of which 
are further explanations, for which see 1:]) [ 9i|> 
also, signifies the same as 91, (S, M, K,) or 9=9 
(Lh, M, K;) [or a manner of hoping or expecting; 
for J adds,] and it is like 99. and 9j: (S:) and 
l 99, likewise, signifies the same as 9): (TA:)

subst. like gp, (M,) He was, or became, or felt, 
secure, safe, or in a state of security or safety; 
originally, he was, or became, quiet, or 
tranquil, in heart, or mind; (Msb;) he was, or 
became, secure, or free from fear; 9 signifying 
the contr. of 99 (s, M, K,) and so 91 (S) 
and 9 [&c.]: (M, K:) he was, or became, or felt, 
free from expectation of evil, or of an object of 
dislike or hatred, in the coming time; originally, 
he was, or became, easy in mind, and free from 
fear. (El-Munawee, TA.) [See 9', below.] You say 
also, ^9 9 93 [He is secure, or safe, or free 
from fear, for himself]. (M.) And 91! 9, meaning 
The inhabitants of the country or district, or 
town, were in a state of security, or confidence, 
therein. (Msb.) The verb is trans. by itself, and by 
means of the particle 9=; as in 9 and 9 

9M meaning Zeyd was, or became, or felt, 
secure from, safe from, [or free from fear of,] the 
lion. (Msb.) You say also, CiiS 9 [He was 

secure from, or free from fear of, the lying of him 
who informed him]. (M.) And 9*3 9 V [I

same (M, K, TA) [He trusted, or confided, in him; 
(as also fy O*', q. v.;) he intrusted him with, or 
confided to him, power, authority, control, or a 
charge; he gave him charge over a thing or

gave him charge over it;] he made him, or took

[liilj] with idgham [i. e. What aileth thee that 
thou dost not trust, or confide, in us with respect

us for him? (Bd;) some pronouncing the verb in a 
manner between those of the former and the 
latter modes of writing it; but Akh says that the 
latter is better: (S:) some read 1"#. (Bd.) You say 
also, J, iP 0"j' [Such a one was trusted,

changing the second « into j; in like manner as 
you change it into lS when the first is with kesr, as 
in ***4'; and into ' when the first is with fet-h, as 
in O*'. (S.) The phrase 0** j' | fA*', in a saying of 
Mohammad, if it be not correctly fA*' p . ; may be 
explained as implying the meaning of fAJ AiHOI 
[He was asked to take care of a deposite; or he 
was intrusted with it]. (Mgh.) [You also say, <i*i 
'1% meaning He intrusted him with such a thing; 
as, for instance, money or other property: see two 
exs. in the Kur iii. 68.] — O*', (M, Mgh, K,) or 0*', 
(Msb,) inf. n. *A*', (M, Mgh, Msb,) He was, or 
became, trusted in, or confided in: (M, K:) or 
he was, or became, trusty, trustworthy, trustful,

2 inf. n. see 4: and see also *lf'. — 

0*', inf. n. as above, also signifies He said 0#*'

(T,) or clcil p on the occasion of the prayer, or

n. Of* 1 *;] (M, TA;) meaning He rendered him 


secure, or safe; (Msb;) he rendered him secure,

so in ki* *AO 1 rendered him secure, or safe, from

enemy], inf. n. as above. (T.) It is said in the Kur 
ch. ix. [verse 12], accord, to one reading, O^! V 
They have not the attribute of granting 
protection; meaning that when they grant 
protection, they do not fulfil their engagement to 
protect. (T.) — u'-M also signifies The believing [a 
thing, or in a thing, and particularly in God]; 
syn. (T, S, &c.;) by common consent of the 

lexicologists and other men of science: (T:) its 
primary meaning is the becoming true to the 
trust with respect to which God has confided 
in one, by a firm believing with the heart; not by 
profession of belief with the tongue only, without 
the assent of the heart; for he who does not 
firmly believe with his heart is either a hypocrite 
or an ignorant person. (T, TA.) Its verb is intrans. 
and trans. (TA, from a Commentary on the 
Mutowwal.) You say, 0*', meaning He believed. 
(T.) And it is said to be trans. by itself, like 3A*>; 
and by means of h, considered as meaning ^'jP\ 
[or acknowledgment]; and by means of J, 
considered as meaning 0^1) [or submission]. 
(TA.) [Thus] you say, [***' and] fy O*', (inf. n. iP4, 
T, K,) namely, a thing. (T, M.) And *^4 0*' 
He believed in God. (T.) It seems to be meant by 
what is said in the Ksh [in ii. 2], that fy O*' 
[or <“S] properly signifies AyA*" *j*i 
[He rendered him secure from being charged 
with lying, or falsehood]; and that the meaning 
he believed him or in him, is tropical; but this is 
at variance with what its author says in the A; 
and Es-Saad says that this latter meaning is 
proper. (TA.) The phrase in the Kur [ix. 
61], Of“>A 0*jfj, accord, to Th, means And he 
believeth the believers; giveth credit to them. 

(M.) Sometimes it is employed to signify 

The acknowledging with the tongue only; and 
hence, in the Kur [lxiii. 3], ' jj& p I >**' ,4*1 AA 
That is because they acknowledged with 
the tongue, then disacknowledged with the heart. 
(TA.) — — Also (assumed tropical:) The 
trusting, or confiding, or having trust or 
confidence. (M, K.) [You say, 4 O*', meaning He 


trusted, or confided, in him, or it: for] the verb 
of iP4 in this sense is trans. by means of y 
without implication; as Bd says. (TA.) [And it is 
also trans. by itself: for] you say, ji 3^ 
fA=**^, meaning (tropical:) He trusted not that he 
would find companions; (M, * K, * TA;) said of 
one who has formed the intention of journeying: 
or the meaning is AS A [i. e. he hardly, 
or scarcely, found &c.; or he was not near to 

finding &c.]. (M, K.) See also *Sfi Also The 

manifesting humility or submission, and 
the accepting the Law, (Zj, T, * K,) and that which 
the Prophet has said or done, and the firm 
believing thereof with the heart; (Zj, T, M;) 
without which firm belief, the manifesting of 
humility or submission, and the accepting that 
which the Prophet has said or done, is 
termed P'-4, for which one’s blood is to be 
spared. (T.) [In this sense, it is trans. by means 
of J, accord, to some, as shown above; or by 
means of for, accord, to Fei,] you say, 44 CiiO,

obedience and the punishment of disobedience: 
but, in my opinion, he says, (T,) it here means the 
intention which one holds in the heart, (T, K,) 
with respect to the belief which he professes with 
the tongue, and with respect to all the obligatory 
statutes which he externally fulfils; (K;) because 
God has confided to him power over it, and not 
manifested it to any [other] of his creatures, so 
that he who conceives in his mind, with respect 
to the acknowledgment of the unity of God, (T,

confidence, therein. (Msh.) It is also said in the 
Kur [xliv. 51], J. 0*?l jli* J uj£*lt Ol meaning 
[Verily the pious shall be in an abode] wherein 
they shall be secure from the accidents, or 
casualties, of fortune. (M.) [And hence,] J, u**VI is 
one of the epithets applied to God, (Mgh, K,) on 
the authority of El-Hasan; (Mgh;) an assertion 
requiring consideration: it may mean He who 
is secure with respect to the accidents, or 
casualties, of fortune: hut see u*j*M, which is 
[well known as] an epithet applied to God.

slaughtered, of the camels, because of its being 
highly prized; by J-*ll being meant JAM: or,

that a* 1 , thus used, is not a mistranscription

disordered in temper, and free from self- 
restraint, there is no fear. (M.) — — See

latter of the dial, of El-Hijaz, (Msb, TA,) as some 
say, (TA,) [and this, though the less common, is 
the original form, for] the medd in the former is 
only to give fulness of sound to the fet-hah of 
the 1, (Th, M, Msh, TA,) as is shown by the fact 
that there is no word in the Arabic language of 
the measure 3^; (Msb, TA;) and some 
pronounce the former 0**!, (K,) which is said by 
some of the learned to be a dial, var., (Msb,) but 
this is a mistake, (S, Msb,) accord, to authorities 
of good repute, and is one of old date, originating 
from an assertion of Ahmad Ibn-Yahya, [i. e. 
Th,] that j*?l is like u by which he was 
falsely supposed to mean its having the form of a 
pi., [and being consequently us*i,] (Msb, [and 
part of this is said in the M,]) whereas he thereby 
only meant that the ? is without teshdeed, like 
the in (M;) beside that the sense 

of [which is that of u**i, from fl,] would be 

inconsistent after the last phrase of the first 
chapter of the Kur [where uj* 1 is usually added]; 
(Msh;) and sometimes it is pronounced with 
imaleh, [i. e. “emeena,”] as is said by ElWahidee 
in the Beseet; (K;) but this is unknown in works 
on lexicology, and is said to he a 
mispronunciation of some of the Arabs of the 
desert of El-Yemen: (MF:) each form is 

indecl., (S,) with fet-h for its termination, like 0)1 
and to prevent the occurrence of two 

quiescent letters together: (T, S, TA:) it is a 
word used immediately after a prayer, or 
supplication: (S, * M:) [it is best expressed, when 
occurring in a translation, by the familiar 
Hebrew equivalent Amen:] El-Farisee says that it 
is a compound of a verb and a noun; (M;) 
meaning answer Thou me; [i. e. answer Thou my 
prayer;] (M, Mgh;*) or O God, answer Thou: (Zj, 
T, Msb, K:) or so be it: (AHat, S, Msb, K:) or so 
do Thou, (K, TA,) O Lord: (TA:) it is strangely 
asserted by some of the learned, that, after the 
Fatihah, [or Opening Chapter of the Kur-an,] it is 
a prayer which implies all that is prayed for 
in detail in the Fatihah: so in the Towsheeh: 
(MF:) or it is one of the names of God: (M, Msb, 


K:) so says El-Hasan (M, Msb) El-Basree: 
(Msb:) but the assertion that it is for <111 L [O

speaker, [I, masc. and fem.,] in the language of 
some of the Arabs: they say, uJ*i Oji [I did], with 
the 0) quiescent: but most of them pronounce it

word; (Mughnee, K;) saying, uJ*3 jl : (TA:) and 


[J, Li] with I in a case of pause: (Mughnee, K:) 
and some pronounce it with I also when it is 
conjoined with a following word; saying, Oil; 
[as we generally find it written in books;] but this 
is of a bad dialect: (TA:) [this last assertion, 
however, requires consideration; for the dial, 
here said to be bad is that of Temeem, accord, to 
what here follows:] the Basrees hold that the 
pronoun consists of the « and the u, and that the 
[final] I is redundant, because it is suppressed in 
a case of conjunction with a following word; but 
the Koofees hold that the pronoun is composed of 
all the three letters, because the I is preserved in a 
case of conjunction with a following word in the 
dial, of Temeem. (Marginal note in a copy of 
the Mughnee.) [Accord, to Az,] it is best to say 
l Ll in a case of pause; and J, ji in a case of 
conjunction with a following word, as in p 
ulxi [1 did that]; but some of the Arabs 
say, Li j, 111 1 cjlii; and some make the u quiescent 
in a case of this kind, though this is 
rare, saying, Llli cJ3 jl [1 said that]; and Kuda'ah 
prolong the former I, saying, 1)1 | LIS. (T.) 
[Accord, to J,] J. Li is a pronoun denoting 
the speaker alone, and is made to end invariably 
with fet-h to distinguish it from the particle J 
which renders the aor. mansoob; the final I being 
for the purpose of showing what is the vowel in a 
case of pause; but when it occurs in the middle 
[or beginning] of a sentence, it is dropped, except 
in a bad dialect. (S.) [Accord, to ISd,] J, J is a 
noun denoting the speaker; and in a case of 
pause, you add I at the end, [saying J, LI,] to 
denote quiescence; (M;) [or] it is better to do 
this, though it is not always done: (TA:) but it is 
said, on the authority of Ktr, that there are five 
dial. vars. of this word; namely, l) | ^3^*3, and 
i Ll, and j jl, and ul, and J, 3 jI, all mentioned by 
IJ; but there is some weakness in this: IJ says 
that the » in J, 3Li may be a substitute for the I in Ll, 
because the latter is the more usual, and the 
former is rare; or it may be added to show what is 
the vowel, like the », and be like the » in 3^US 
and 3^U^.. (M.) For the dual, as well as the pi., 
only u=>j is used. (Az, TA.) — — It is also 
a pronoun denoting the person addressed, or 
spoken to, by assuming the form J, ciiji [Thou, 
masc.]; cii being added to it as the sign of the 
person addressed, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) and ul 
being the pronoun, (M, Mughnee, K,) accord, to 
the general opinion; (Mughnee, K;) the two 
becoming as one; not that one is prefixed to the 
other as governing it in the gen. case: (S:) and so 
l ^ui, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to the 
female: (S, M:) and J, L>ii, (M, Mughnee, K,) 
addressed to two; not a regular dual, for were it 
so it would be uLii; but like in U£jjju= :

(M:) and [ f 4 and J, y 4 , (S, Mughnee, K,) which 
are [respectively] the masc. and fern. pis. (TA.) — 
— To each of these the Al of comparison is 
sometimes prefixed; so that you say, J, c<ii 
[Thou art like me, or as I], and ) Adi 111 [or yl 
AiilS i am like thee, or as thou]; as is related on 
the authority of the Arabs; for though the Ai of 
comparison is not prefixed to the [affixed] 
pronoun, and you say, 4 j& Aiii but not Ciii, yet 
the separate pronoun is regarded by them as 
being in the same predicament as the noun; and 
therefore the prefixing it to the latter kind of 
pronoun is approved. (S.) It is said in the Book 
of yff, by IKh, that there is no such phrase, in the 
language of the Arabs, as ^ Ciii ; nor as Ui ; 
except in two forged verses; wherefore Sb says 
that the Arabs, by saying Aiii and Alii* 4 , have 
no need of saying ^ Ciii and ^ Ui : and the two 
verses are these: Ikf ifkll liS l^ilSL! iiUll Vjij 
f«^ [And but for the sense of shame, we had been 
like them, or as they: and but for trial, or 
affliction, they had been like us, or as we]: and yl 
yl i-iA . A i {Sill ^ lijl tfcja 41 S jZ jSl [if thou 
art like me, or as I, verily I am like thee, or as 
thou, in respect of her, or it, or them: verily we, in 
respect of blame, are companions]. (TA.) Az 
mentions his having heard some of the Benoo- 
Suleym say, ^ , [the latter word being a 

compound of the pronoun Aiii, regularly 
written separately, and the affixed pronoun ^,] 
meaning Wait thou for me in thy place. (TA.) — 
It is also a particle: and as such, it is— First, 
a particle of the kind called Is rendering the 
aor. mansoob: (Mughnee, K:) i. e., (TA,) it 
combines with a verb [in this case] in the 
future [or aor.] tense, following it, to form an 
equivalent to an inf. n., and renders it mansoob: 
(S, TA:) you say, yl Ajj' [I desire that 
thou stand, or that thou wouldst stand, or that 
thou mayest stand]; meaning ajjI [I desire 
thy standing]. (S.) It occurs in two places: first, in 
that of the inchoative, or in the beginning of a 
phrase, so that it is in the place of a nom. case; as 
in the saying [in the Kur ii. 180], I j* y'j 

f 4 [And that ye fast is better for you]; (Mughnee, 
K;) i. e. f S .»l k-» [your fasting]. (TA.) And, 
secondly, after a word denoting a meaning which 
is not that of certainty: and thus it is the place of 
a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur lvii. 
15], fifj^ yl I jkl jjill jlj pi [Hath not the 
time that their hearts should become submissive, 
i. e. the time of their hearts' becoming 
submissive, yet come unto those who have 
believed?]: and in the place of an accus. case; as 
in the saying [in the Kur x. 38], yl yl jail lia ylS lij 
e >4 [And this Kur-an is not such that it might be 


forged; i. e., XI jjsI; so in Bd and Jel; and so in a 
marginal note to a copy of the Mughnee, where 
is added, meaning yjkl forged]: and in the place 
of a gen. case; as in the saying [in the Kur lxiii. 
10], Aijill fiji.1 yl Jis y* [Before that death 
come unto any one of you; i. e. before death's 
coming unto any one of you]. (Mughnee, K.) 
Sometimes it makes the aor. to be of the 
mejzoom form, (Mughnee, K,) as some of the 
Koofees and AO have mentioned, and as Lh has 
stated on the authority of certain of the Benoo- 
Sabbah of Dabbeh; (Mughnee;) as in this 
verse: -Ai'' 1 —A yl k.ylU3 UIaI yliilj ,_]li llj.k k 111 
[when we went away in the morning, the 
youths of our family, or people, said, Come ye, 
until that the chase come to us, (i. e. until the 
coming of the chase to us,) let us collect 
firewood]. (Mughnee, K.) And sometimes it is 
followed by an aor. of the marfooa form; as in the 
saying [in the Kur ii. 233], accord, to the reading 
of Ibn-Moheysin, fi 0 1 iljl dP [For him 

who desireth that he may complete the time of 
sucking; i. e. the completing thereof]; 
(Mughnee, K;) but this is anomalous, (I 'Ak p. 
101, and TA,) or yl is here a contraction of yl 
[for ■'jib (I ’Ak:) and in the saying of the 
poet, I JpA V yij pui jjio USkjj tUbi yljaj yl 
l-^i [That ye two convey, or communicate, to 
Asma, (mercy on you! or woe to you!) from 
me, salutation, and that ye inform not any one]; 
but the Koofees assert that yl is here [in the 
beginning of the verse] a contraction of yl, 
and anomalously conjoined with the verb; 
whereas the Basrees correctly say that it is yl 
which renders the aor. mansoob, but is deprived 
of government by its being made to accord with 
its co-ordinate A, termed <ij.ikk; (Mughnee;) or, 
as IJ says, on the authority of Aboo-'Alee, yl 
is here used by poetic licence for l-«£jl; and the 
opinion of the Baghdadees [and Basrees], that it 
is likened to A, and therefore 
without government, is improbable, because yl is 
not conjoined with a verb in the present tense, 
but only with the preterite and the future. (M.) 
When it is suppressed, the aor. may be either 
mansoob or marfooa; but the latter is the better; 
as in the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 64], <111 jiiai 
A°l [Other than God do ye bid me 

worship?]. (S.) If it occurs immediately before a 
preterite, it combines with it to form 
an equivalent to an inf. n. relating to past time; 
being in this case without government: you 
say, Alia tj Uupc .1 [it pleased me that 

thou stoodest]; meaning thy standing that is past 
pleased me: (S:) and thus it is used in the saying 
[in the Kur xxviii. 82], 44 - <111 yi yl V jl [Were it 


not for that God conferred favour upon us; i. e., 
for God's having conferred favour upon us]. 
(Mughnee.) It is also conjoined with an 
imperative; as in the phrase mentioned by 
Sb, fa 3 jb <JI Cm £ [1 wrote to him, Stand; i. e. I 
wrote to him the command to stand]; 
which shows that AHei is wrong in asserting that 
whenever it is conjoined with an imperative it is 
an explicative [in the sense of l?I], and that in this 
particular instance the m may be redundant, 
which it cannot here be, because, whether 
redundant or not, it is not put immediately 
before anything but a noun or what may be 

rendered by a noun. (Mughnee.) Secondly, 

it is a con- traction of yl; (Mughnee, K;) and 
occurs after a verb denoting certainty, or one 
used in a manner similar to that of such a verb: 
(Mughnee:) so in the saying [in the Kur lxxiii. 
20], f ^4 yjSlu yi ^k [He knoweth that (the 

case will be this:) there will be among you some 
diseased; the affixed pronoun », meaning yUl, 
being understood after yl, which therefore stands 
for <ii, i. e. ylill yl]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the 
phrase, 1 & j 14 yl£ ia yl lJ Cim [it has come to my 
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told to 
me, or it came to my knowledge, &c., that (the 
case is this:) such and such things have been]; a 
phrase of this kind, in which yl occurs with a 
verb, not being approved without jS, unless you 
say, laSj laS yl S <31 (jjiij: (Lth, T:) [for] when the 
contracted yl has for its predicate a verbal 
proposition, of which the verb is neither 
imperfectly inflected, like yff and nor 

expressive of a prayer or an imprecation, it is 
separated from the verb, according to the more 
approved usage, by -A or the prefix y«, or — or 
a negative, as V &c., or jl: (I 'Ak pp. too and 101:) 
but when its predicate is a nominal proposition, 
it requires not a separation; so that you say, 
CCC fjla 4j yl Aiik [I knew that (the case was 
this:) Zeyd was standing]; (I 'Ak p. too;) and 
J jA- 40 yl [It has come to my knowledge, or been 
related to me, or been told to me, &c., that (the 
case is this:) Zeyd is going, or coming, out, or 
forth]; (TA;) except in the case of a negation, as 
in the saying in the Kur [xi. 17], > Sfl <11 V yl j 
[And that (the case is this:) there is no deity but 
He]. (I 'Ak p. too.) Thus used, it is originally 
triliteral, and is also what is termed f4] 
yl, in the first of the exs. above, for 
instance, meaning <ii fk-, i. e. yi- 4 l yl -Jc., which is 
equivalent to ykJI yj£ ,1k;] and governs the 
subject in the accus. case, and the predicate 
in the nom. case: and its subject must be a 
pronoun, suppressed, [as in the exs. given above, 
where it means yAJI, and in a verse cited

[BOOKI.] 


before, commencing glj£ us accord, to A'boo- 
'Alee,] or expressed; the latter, accord, to the 
more correct opinion, being allowable only by 
poetic license: and its predicate must be a 
proposition, unless the subject is expressed, in 
which case it may be either a single word or 
a proposition; both of which kinds occur in the 
following saying [of a poet]: j £jj'j AjL 

VU 3 I jjSl Sjjt, 4 Lij [he is speaking of persons 
coming as guests to him whom he addresses, 
when their provisions are exhausted, and the 
horizon is dust-coloured, and the north wind 
is blowing, (as is shown by the citation of the 
verse immediately preceding, in the T,) and he 
says, They know that thou art like rain that 
produces spring-herbage, and like plenteous rain, 
and that thou, there, art the aider and the 
manager of the affairs of people]. (Mughnee. [In 
the T, for I find ^hjII; and for *Ajlj, I there 
find but the reading in the Mughnee is that 
which is the more known.]) [J says,] gl is 
sometimes a contraction of gl and does not 
govern [anything]: you say, jr J-k gi 
[explained above]; and it is said in the Kur [vii. 
41], AiJI gi Ijijij [And it shall be 

proclaimed to them that (the case is this:) that is 
Paradise]: (S:) [here, however, Ai is regarded by 
some as an explicative, as will be seen below:] 
but in saying this, J means that it does not govern 
as to the letter; for virtually it does govern; its 
subject being meant to be understood; the virtual 
meaning being A=JI Al. (IB.) [In another 
place, J says,] You may make the contracted gi to 
govern or not, as you please. (S.) Aboo-Talib the 
Grammarian mentions an assertion that the 
Arabs make it to govern; as in the saying [of a 
poet, describing a beautiful bosom], glik A«A uA 
[As though its two breasts were two small round 
boxes]: but [the reading commonly known is gl£ 
jlik iUii (this latter reading is given in De Sacy’s 
Anthol. Gram. Ar. p. 104 of the Ar. text; and 
both are given in the S;) g 4 > here meaning AlS; 
and] Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use 
the contracted form and make it to govern 
except with a pronoun, in which case the 
desinential syntax is not apparent. (T.) The 
author of the K says in the B that you say, gi 

I 4 j [I knew that Zeyd was indeed going 
away], with J when it is made to govern; 
and jlfait 4 j gl [I knew that (the case was 
this:) Zeyd was going away], without J when it is 
made to have no government. (TA. [But in the 
latter ex. it governs the subject, which is 
understood, as in other exs. before given.]) [See 
an ex. in a verse ending with the phrase gl£j 
cited voce where uA is for < 4 % meaning gl£ 
jlill, and a verb is understood after A And see 


also gl, below.] Thirdly, it is an explicative, 

(Mughnee, K,) meaning (si (S, M, and so in some 
copies of the K,) or [rather] used in the manner 
of (si; (Mughnee, and so in some copies of the K;) 
[meaning >ju, or (jAA; or (J or gA or some 
other form of the verb (A; i. e. Saying ; &c.;] as in 
the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 27], t^l gi A^! 

™ul [And we revealed, or spake by revelation, 
unto him, saying, Make thou the ark]; (Mughnee, 
K) and [in the Kur vii. 41JAAJI ^ gi I jj jjj [And 
it shall be proclaimed to them, being said, That is 
Paradise]; or in these two instances it may be 
regarded as what is termed by supposing 

the preposition [w- 1 ] understood before it, so that 
in the former instance it is the biliteral, because it 
is put before the imperative, and in the second it 
is the contraction of gi because it is put before a 
nominal proposition; (Mughnee;) and [in the Kur 
xxxviii. 5,] I >i*l gi 5 U 1 I ji^l j(S, M, Mughnee) 

i. e. [And the chief persons of them] broke 
forth, or launched forth, with their tongues, or in 
speech, [saying,] Go ye on, or continue ye, in your 
course of action & c. (Mughnee.) For this 
usage of gl certain conditions are requisite : first, 
that it be preceded by a proposition : secondly, 
that it be followed by a proposition; so that you 
may not say, 4*^ gl HALe cjjSi, but you must 
say Is I in this case, or must omit the explicative : 
thirdly, that the preceding proposition convey the 
meaning of (Jj“l, as in the exs. above; in the last 
of which, l 3'^l has the meaning assigned to it 
above; not that of walking or going away : 
fourthly, that there be not in the preceding 
proposition the letters of OjP; so that one may 
not say, 3*sl gl Ai or, if there be in it those 
letters, that the word which they compose shall 
be interpreted by another word; as in the saying, 
in the Kur [v, 117], I jA^I gi YJ fA Alia U 

"dll which may mean, as Z says, I have not 
commanded them [aught save that which Thou 
commandedst me, saying, Worship ye God]; 
(Mughnee;) in which instance Fr says that it is an 
explicative : (T :) fifthly, that there be not a 
preposition immediately before it; for if you 
say, IdS 0*il g 4 Ad! it is what is 

termed AjA^> [as we have before shown]. 
(Mughnee.) When it may be regarded as an 
explicative and is followed by an aor. with V as 
in liS JiA V (ji Ad! ^■‘jdl, it may be marfooa, 
[namely, the aor.,] on the supposition that V is a 
negative ; or mejzoom, on the supposition that it 
is a prohibitive; and in both cases gl is an 
explicative ; [so that the meaning is, I made a 
sign to him, as though saying, Thou wilt not 
do such a thing, in the former case ; or, in the 
latter, Do not thou such a thing ;] or mansoob, on 
the supposition that V is a negative and that gl is 


what is termed Aj- 1 -^: but if V is wanting, it may 
not be mejzoom, but may be marfooa [if we use gl 
as an explicative] or mansoob [if gl be what is 

termed (Mughnee.) Fourthly, it is 

redundant, as a corroborative, (Mughnee, K,) like 
whatever else is redundant : and thus it is in four 
cases : one of these, which is the most common, 
being when it occurs after dJ denoting time; [and 
this is mentioned in the M ; ] as in the saying [in 
the Kur xxix. 32], Ci gi UJj [And 

when our apostles came to Lot]: (Mughnee:) [or,] 
accord, to J, (TA,) it is sometimes a connective 
to lil; as in the saying in the Kur [xii. 96], gl lAa 
i l-d [And when that (like as we say, " 
now that,") the announcer of good tidings came] : 
and sometimes it is redundant ; as in the saying 
in the Kur [viii. 34], All V gi f&l Uj [as 

though it might be rendered But what reason 
have they, God should not punish them?] : (S, 
TA:) but IB says that the connective is redundant 
; and [that gl is not redundant in the latter 
instance, for] if it were redundant in this verse of 
the Kur it would not render the [aor.] verb 
mansoob. (TA. [The author of the Mughnee, like 
IB, disallows that gl is redundant in a case of this 
kind, which Kh asserts it to be ; and says that J 
is under- stood before it.]) The second case is 
when it occurs between jl and a verb signifying 
swearing, the latter being expressed; as in this 
verse: (1 At g* 'A glSU (jjIj LAllI A gl .L-l'-i 
[And I swear, had we and you met, there had 
been to us a dark day of evil]: and when that verb 
is omitted; as in the following ex.: A gl AII3 Ui 

gii*JI Vj cjjljQ^A lij Iji. [Verily, or now 
surely, by God, if thou wert freeborn; but thou art 
not the freeborn nor the emancipated]: so say Sb 
and others: Ibn-'Os- foor holds it to be a particle 
employed to connect the complement of the oath 
with the oath; but this is rendered improbable by 
the fact that it is in most cases omitted, and such 
particles are not. (Mughnee.) The third case, 
which is extr., is when it occurs between the A [of 
comparison] and the noun governed by it in the 
genitive case; as in the saying, A^-Ji 4^1 A '- i Aj 
(AUl c 3 jlj lsA! AS^ glS [And on a day thou 
comest to us with a beautiful face, like a doe- 
gazelle raising her head towards the goodly 
green-leaved tree of the selem kind], accord, to 
the reading of him who makes AA=> to be governed 
in the genitive case [instead of the accus. or the 
norm; for if we read it in the accus. or the 
norm, gl is a contraction of gl; in the former 
case, AA=> being its subject, and its predicate 
being suppressed; and in the latter case, the 
meaning being AA=> 4 -^, so that the subject of gl 
is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The fourth case is 
when it occurs after I A!; as in the following 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version VI .1 107 


ex.: jLJI ■caJ jj 4_ii£> ji |j| j ’, ; L j 

[And I leave him alone until when he is as though 
he were a giver of a hand to be laid hold upon, 
in the fathomless deep of the water immerged]. 
(Mughnee.) — — [Fifthly,] among other 
meanings which have been assigned to 
it, (Mughnee,) it has a conditional meaning, 
like jj: (Mughnee, K:) so the Koofees hold; and it 
seems to be most probably correct, for 
several reasons: first, because both these forms 
occur, accord, to different readings, in several 
instances, in one passage of the Kur; as in 
[ii. 282,] Ualikl ji [if one of them twain 
(namely, women,) err]; &c.: secondly, because 
[the prefix] ‘-j often occurs after it; as in a 
verse commencing with <* 51 j^ ^ [as cited voce 
accord, to some who hold that L>' in that verse is a 
compound of the conditional ji and 
the redundant L>; and as in the Kur ii. 282, where 
the words quoted above are immediately followed 
by jSia]: thirdly, because it 

is conjoined with j ! [which forms a part of the 
compound ^J] in this ex.: cjji Uj iiiai UJ 

j jj Uj U ySj ijlli [if thou remain, and if thou 
be going away (G>i meaning ciiiS ji, as syn. with jj 
U“), may God guard thee (iU) being marfooa 
because of the l -*) as long as thou doest and as 
long as thou leavest undone]: thus related, with 
kesr to the former jl [in LI] and with fet-h to the 

latter [in Ui], (Mughnee.) [Sixthly,] it is a 

negative, like jj: (Mughnee, K:) so, as some say, 
in [the Kur iii. 66,] fjjjji jji 

[meaning accord, to them Not any one is given 
the like of that scripture which ye have been 
given]: but it is said [by others] that the meaning 
is, [taken with what precedes it,] And believe not 
ye that ( jb) any one is given the like of that 
scripture which ye have been given, except it be 
given to him who followeth your religion; and 
that the phrase “ say thou, Verily the direction is 
the direction of God,” is parenthetic. (Mughnee.) 
— — [Seventhly,] it is syn. with \J, (AZ, T, 
Mughnee, K, [in Freytag's Lex., from the K, ij, 
but JjS in the K relates to what there follows,]) as 
some say, in [the Kur 1 . 2,] fiAU ji I ji=^e 3 ) 
[Verily they wonder because a warner 
from among themselves hath come unto them]; 
(Mughnee, K;) and in other instances; but 
correctly, in all these instances, jl is what is 
termed and J denoting cause 

is understood before it. (Mughnee.) [See also 
and Lil.] _ _ [Eighthly,] it is syn. with ibj, 
accord, to some, in [the Kur iv. last verse,] Oa 
IjLij jliill [God explaineth to you (the 
ordinances of your religion, Jel), lest ye should 
err, or in order that ye may not err]; (Mughnee, 


K;) and in the saying, Jjii fil ji 

ji jjill [Ye became, or have become, in the 
condition of our guests; so we hastened, or have 
hastened, the entertainment, lest ye should 
revile us, or in order that ye should not revile us]: 
(Mughnee:) but correctly, in such a case 
[likewise], jl is what is termed and the 

original wording is i ji4“ ji [from a motive 

of dislike that ye should err], (Mughnee, K,) 
and L jiLii ji 5 itLi [from a motive of fear that ye 
should revile us]: so say the Basrees: some say, 
extravagantly, that J is meant to be understood 
before it, and (.s^l after it. (Mughnee.) — — 
[Ninthly,] it occurs in the sense of lS X; as in the 
saying, ji if tU“-l Xj [Zeyd is more 

reasonable than he who lies; which is 
equivalent to saying, Zeyd is too reasonable to lie: 
but respecting its usage in a phrase of this kind, 
and respecting the form of the aor. after it in such 

a case, see j?]. (Kull p. 78.) By a peculiarity 

of pronunciation termed the tribe of 

Temeem say if instead of jl (M.) jj is used in 
various ways: first, as a conditional particle, 
(S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting the 
happening of the second of two events in 
consequence of the happening of the first, (S, 
Msb, *) whether the second be immediate or 
deferred, and whether the condition 
be affirmative or negative; (Msb;) [and as such it 
is followed by a mejzoom aor., or by a pret. 
having the signification of an aor.;] as in 
the saying, [ 3 *si jj If thou do such a thing, I 
will do it; and] bEi i>\ [If thou come to me, I 
will come to thee]; and jj [If thou 

come to me, I will treat thee with honour]; (S;) 
and jl [if thou do, I will do] for which 

the tribe of Teiyi say, as IJ relates on the 
authority of Ktr, bJis cJia j* ; (M;) and bJlj jj 
ji jlill [if thou stand, I will stand]; and bJlj jt 
JjllL cjjli ji jl X [if thou enter the 

house, or if thou enter not the house, thou shalt 
be divorced]; (Msb;) and [in the Kur viii. 39,] jj 
—it— Ja U jaij I jjji [if they desist, what hath 
already past shall be forgiven them]; and [in 
verse 19 of the same ch.,] ^ IjA>*j jlj [But if 
ye return to attacking the Apostle, we will return 
to assisting him]. (Mughnee, K.) [On the 
difference between it and X, see the 
latter.] When either it or X is immediately 
followed by a noun in the nom. case, the said 
noun is governed in that case by a verb 
necessarily suppressed, of which it is the agent; 
as in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6], if Xd jjj 
jijtAid jjSjiill; the complete phrase being jjj 
j! jUiLI ji jiill j* iljUdLI [And if any one of 
the believers in a plurality of gods demand 


protection of thee, (if) he demand protection of 
thee]: so accord, to the generality of the 
grammarians. (I ’Ak p. 123.) Sometimes it is 
conjoined with the negative X and the ignorant 
may imagine it to be the exceptive X; as in [the 
saying in the Kur ix. 40,] <111 ii a l X [If 

ye will not aid him, certainly God did aid him]; 
and [in the next preceding verse,] f£j:aj I j X 

[If ye will not go forth to war, He will punish 
you]. (Mughnee, K. *) It is sometimes used to 
denote one's feigning himself ignorant; as when 
you say to one who asks, “Is thy child in the 
house? ” and thou hast knowledge thereof, jl£ ill 
jlX [If he be in the house, I will 
inform thee thereof]. (Msb.) And to denote one's 
putting the knowing in the predicament of the 
ignorant, in order to incite to the doing or 
continuing an action; as when you say, ^1 ciiiS jt 
eX'-LU [If thou be my son, obey me]; as though 
you said, “Thou knowest that thou art my son, 
and it is incumbent on the son to obey the father, 
and thou art not obedient; therefore do what 
thou art commanded to do. ” (Msb.) And 
sometimes it is divested of the conditional 
meaning, and becomes syn. with jl; as in the 
saying, Xp if- ^ jp. jl j 3 ^ [Pray thou 
though thou be unable to stand;] i. e. pray thou 
whether thou be able to stand or unable to do so; 
and in the saying, jlj I jjj f jii i. e. [Treat thou 
Zeyd with honour] though he be sitting; or, 
whether he sit or not. (Msb.) [^>1 as a compound 
of the conditional jj and the redundant L>, see in 
an art. of which L>l is the heading.] — — 
[Secondly,] it is a negative, (S, Mughnee, K,) syn. 
with l-i; (S;) and is put before a nominal 
proposition; (Mughnee, K;) as in the saying [in 
the Kur lxvii. 20], jjif ^ XJ j! [The 

unbelievers are not in aught save in a deception]; 
(S, Mughnee, K;) and before a verbal proposition; 
as in [the Kur ix. 108,] X u! [We 

desired not, or meant not, aught save that which 
is best]. (Mughnee, K.) The assertion of some, 
that the negative jj does not occur except where 
it is followed by X, as in the instances cited 
above, or by with tesh-deed, which is 
syn. therewith, as, accord, to a reading of some of 
the Seven [Readers], in the saying [in the Kur 
lxxxvi. 4], -LaL* tfcilc GJ jjii 3^ jl, i. e., X 
iiiU, tjjlc [There is not any soul but over it is a 
guardian], is refuted by the sayings in the Kur [x. 
69 andlxxii. 26], jlLlL j* ^Sjic jl [meaning, 
accord, to the Jel., Ye have no proof of this 
that ye say], and jj-^ jj ti u! [I know not 

whether that with which ye are threatened be 
nigh]. (Mughnee, K. *) The conditional and 
the negative both occur in the saying in the Kur

[BOOKI.] 


[xxxv. 39 ], y? 31 y- yj 1^1 j 343 [And I 

swear that, if they should quit their place, not any 
one should withhold them after Him]: the former 
is conditional; and the latter is negative, and is 
[part of] the complement of the oath which is 
denoted by the J prefixed to the former; 
the complement of the condition being 
necessarily suppressed. (Mughnee.) When it is 
put before a nominal proposition, it has no 
government, accord, to Sb and Fr; but Ks and 
Mbr allow its governing in the manner of 
and Sa'eed Ibn-Jubeyr reads, [in the Kur vii. 
193 ,] filllti liljc. -dll ,jj.i y* jjcij jjil yj [Those 
whom ye invoke beside God, or others than God, 
are not men like you]: also, the people of El- 
'Aliyeh have been heard to say, V J 3 y*l jji 3 y) 
■13UJ4 [Any one is not better than any other one, 
except by means of health, or soundness]; and yj 
i!jUi 'ij 3iU 3 [That is not profitable to thee 
nor injurious to thee]: as an ex. of its occurrence 
without government, which is mostly the case, 
the saying of some, yj J. may be explained as 
originally fjla 14 yj [I am not standing]; the I of 'll 
being elided for no reason in itself, and the y of yj 
being incorporated into the y of 1 ^', and the I of 
this latter being elided in its conjunction with the 
following word; but 131a yj has also been heard. 
(Mughnee.) Sometimes it occurs [as a negative] 
in the complement of an oath: you say, yj 
3*i, meaning I* [By God, I did not]. (S.) — 
— [Thirdly,] it is a contraction of yj, and is put 
before a nominal and before a verbal proposition. 
(Mughnee, K.) In the former case, it is made to 
govern and is made to have no government: (S, * 
K:) [i. e.] in this case, it is allowable to make it 
govern; contr. to the opinion of the 
Koofees: (Mughnee:) Lth says that he who uses 
the contracted form of yj uses the nom. case with 
it, except that some of the people of El-Hijaz use 
the accus. case with it: (T:) thus it is said, accord, 
to one reading, [in the Kur xi. 113 ,] U1 its yj 
^JUci 41 j [Verily all of them, thy Lord will 

indeed fully render them the recompense of their 
works]: (T, Mughnee:) Fr says, We have not 
heard the Arabs use the contracted form and 
make it to govern, unless with a pronoun, in 
which case the desinential syntax is not apparent; 
and he adds that in the instance cited above, they 
make to be governed in the accus. case 
by f« 4 a j4; as though the phrase were ^ 
and that 3^ would be proper; for you say, 4 j yj 
£lal [Verily Zeyd is standing]: (T:) the ex. given 
by Sb is, l>3 yj [Verily ’Amr is going 

away]. (Mughnee.) But it is [most] frequently 
made to have no government; as in the saying [in 
the Kur xliii. 34 accord, to one reading], 3^ yjj 
Uilll ;131I g’lii lil [And verily all that is the 


furniture of the present life]; and, accord, to the 
reading of Hafs, [and of 'Asim and Kh, in the Kur 
xx. 66 , respecting which see yly».UJ yli* yj [,yl 
[Verily these two are enchanters]; &c. 
(Mughnee.) When it is put before a verbal 
proposition, it is necessarily made to have no 
government: (Mughnee, K:) and in most cases 
the verb is a preterite and of the kind called 
[which effects a change of the grammatical form 
or of the meaning in a nominal proposition 
before which it is placed]; as in the saying [in the 
Kur ii. 138 ], yjj [And verily it was a 

great matter]; and [in the Kur xvii. 75 ,] I j ^ yjj 
^>44 [And verily they were near to 
seducing thee]; (Mughnee;) in which last ex. AZ 
says, it means i*l, i. e. without doubt; and so in 
the same ch. w. 78 and 108 : (T:) less frequently 
it is an aor. of a verb of this kind; as in the saying 
[in the Kur xxvi. 186 ], y3l4ll 34 yjj [And 
verily we think thee to be of the number of the 
liars]: and both these kinds of expression may be 
taken as exs. to be imitated: less frequently than 
this it is a preterite of a verb not of the kind 
termed as in the saying [of a poet], 4 L 3 
ULAl cJjs yj [May thy right arm, or hand, dry up, 
or become unsound! verily thou hast slain a 
Muslim]; but this may not be taken as an ex. to 
be imitated; contr. to the opinion of Akh; for he 
allows the phrase, LV 41 yj [Verily I stood], and yj 
cjiV 3 [Verily thou sattest]: and less frequently 
than this it is an aor. of a verb not of the kind 
termed as in the saying, yjj yj 

■44 4:13 . 1 [Verily thy soul is that which beautifies 
thee, and it is that which deforms thee]; and this, 
by common consent, may not be taken as an ex. 
to be imitated. (Mughnee.) Wherever you find yj 
with 3 after it, decide that it is originally yj; 
(Mughnee, K;) as in the exs. above: but 
respecting this 3 there is a difference of opinion: 
see this letter. (Mughnee.) J says, (TA,) yj is 
sometimes a contraction of yj, and this must 
have 3 put before its predicate, to compensate for 
what is elided, of the doubled letter; as in the 
saying in the Kur [lxxxvi. 4 , accord, to him who 
reads 13 instead of 44 =- 3 3^ yj ,[ 1-1 

[Verily every soul hath over it a guardian]; and in 
the saying, *3 j±.V 4 j yj [Verily Zeyd is 
thy brother]; in order that it may not be 
confounded with yj which is syn. with the 
negative (S, TA:) but IB says, 3 is here 
introduced to distinguish between negation and 
affirmation, and this yj has neither subject nor 
predicate; so J's saying that the 3 is put before 
its predicate is without meaning: and this 3 is 
sometimes introduced with the objective 
complement of a verb; as in A 3 3j3 yj [Verily 
I struck, or beat, Zeyd]; and with the agent; as 


in yj [Verily Zeyd stood]. (TA.) When the 

contracted yj governs, this 3 is not necessary; so 
you may say, ^ 14 j yj [Verily Zeyd is 

standing]; because in this case it cannot be 
confounded with the negative; for the negative 
does not render the subject mansoob and the 
predicate marfooa: and when it does not govern, 
if the meaning is apparent, the 3 is not needed; as 

in yAiill 43^ ClljlS. yj j 4 I]La 31 y* ~ AjJall olll 

[And we are persons who refuse to submit to 
injury, of the family of Malik: and verily the 
family of Malik are generous in respect of 
their origins]; 3 il£ being here for ciulil. (1 'Ak p. 
99 .) — — [Fourthly,] it is redundant, (S, 
Mughnee, K,) occurring with 3 as in the 
saying, 4j <34 yj 1- [Zeyd does not stand]; (S;) 
and in the saying [of a poet], 3 34' uj 1 ^ 

[Thou didst not a thing which 
thou dislikest]. (Mughnee, K: in the CK '-3.) It is 
mostly thus used after the negative 3, when put 
before a verbal proposition; as above; or before a 
nominal proposition; as in the saying, LUlii 
34 j 33?- 'A3 yj 1-3 [And our habit is not 

cowardice; but our destinies and the good fortune 
of others caused our being defeated]: and in 
this case it prevents the government of L>, as in 
this verse: but in the saying, 4 * j £3 yj l- 4il4e A 
—“>31 £ul jSlj ILy— V j [Sons of Ghudaneh, ye are 
not indeed gold, nor silver, or pure silver, but ye 
are pottery], accord, to him who relates it thus, 
saying 'A ' 1 and lijy*- 3 , in the accus. case, it is 
explained as a negative, corroborative 
of 3: (Mughnee:) and accord, to J, (TA,) the 
negatives 1 - and yj are sometimes thus combined 
for corroboration; as in the saying of the rajiz, 
(El-Aghlab El-’Ijlee, TA,) yj 3 I jlaj “3® 43 j25>1 
Ijlil liii 3j [We have not indeed seen a king 
who has made a hostile incursion 
possessing more numerous sheep, or goats, and 
camels, than he]; (S, TA;) but IB says that yl is 
here redundant, not a negative. (TA.) Sometimes 
it is redundant after the conjunct noun 3; as in 
the saying, »l3l yjj 3-= A'j II ji V yj U jjill A1& 
mj 3JI [Man hopes for that which he will not 
see; for calamities intervene as obstacles in the 
way to what is nearest thereof]. (Mughnee.) And 
after the 3 termed (Mughnee,) [i. 

e.,] after the adverbial 3 [which is of the kind 
termed 3 “]; (TA;) as in the saying (of 
Maaloot El-Kurey'ee, cited by Sb, TA), ^311 j jj 
40“ 3' jjjV ' 34“- 3311 A yj U ylLll [And hope 
thou that the youth is destined for good as long 
as thou hast seen him not ceasing to increase in 
good with age]. (Mughnee.) And after the 
inceptive VI; as in the saying, -4 ls'A yj VI 
yjill ylS yl 3)131 GuS [Now he journeyed 
on, or during, that my night, and I passed the 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version VI .1 109 


night in an evil state, broken in spirit by grief, 
being fearful that the distance to which he was 
going with Ghadoob (a woman so named) would 
become far]. (Mughnee.) And before the meddeh 
denoting disapproval: [for] Sh heard a man, on 
its being said to him, “Wilt thou go forth if the 
desert become plentiful in herbage? ” reply, ■SyJ till 
[What, I, indeed?] disapproving that he should 
think otherwise than that. (Mughnee. [See also 

art. ^1.]) [Fifthly,] it is syn. with so it is 

said to be in the saying [in the Kur lxxxvii. 9], d! 
lsO^I tiki; [Admonition hath profited], (T, 
Mughnee, K,) by LAar (T) and by Ktr: (Mughnee:) 
and Abu-1-' Abbas relates that the Arabs say, u] 
Ci« ii meaning i j jl ia [Zeyd has stood]; 
and he adds, that Ks states his having heard them 
say so, and having thought that it expressed a 
condition, but that he asked them, and they 
answered that they meant -4 j jl 1, and not jl 1 
■tij. (T.) [So too, accord, to the K, in all the exs. 
cited in the next sentence as from the Mughnee; 
but this is evidently a mistake, occasioned by an 
accidental omission.] — — [Sixthly,] it is 

asserted also by the Koofees, that it is syn. with ij, 
in the following exs.: in the Kur [v. 62], ■dll I d^lj 
df“jti jil u! [And fear ye God, because ye are 
believers: and so, accord, to AZ, as is said in the 
T, in a similar instance in the Kur ii. 278: and in 
the same, iv. 62]: and [in the Kur xlviii. 27,] till 
dfy“l i Li (jl jl jail M l jlk [Ye shall 
assuredly enter the sacred mosque, because God 
hath willed, in security]: and in like instances, 
when the verb therein expresses what is held sure 
to happen or to have happened: and in the 
saying, d?l JjAI M d jl j I ti djia til <j) . id» ui 
e jl-k [Art thou angry because the ears of Kuteybeh 
have been cut, openly, or publicly, and wast not 
angry for the slaughter of Ibn-Hazim?]: 
(Mughnee:) but in all these instances [it 
is sufficiently obvious that] ul may be otherwise 

explained. (Mughnee, K.) [Seventhly,] it is 

sometimes syn. with til; as in the Kur [ix. 23], V 

^jLajVI L 5 lc. j >a£ill I vl-l cUljl jljl^jiJj jSkljl 

[Take not ye your fathers and your brethren as 
friends when they love unbelief above belief]; and 
in the same [xxxiii. 49], Maj jl Alyi si jilj 
(sftil [And a believing woman when she 

giveth herself to the Prophet]: so says AZ. (T.) — 
— [Eighthly,] it is used for 1J, (Mughnee and 
K, voce ti>],) distinct from 11 which is a compound 
of the conditional u! and the redundant li. 
(Mughnee ibid.) [See an ex. in a verse cited 
voce ti>! in the present work, commencing with 
the words M jjll Ail**..] ji: see us in four places. J 
is one of the particles which annul the quality of 
the inchoative; and is originally u!; therefore Sb 


has not mentioned it among those particles [as 
distinct from u!, from which, however, it is 
distinguished in meaning]: (I ’Ak p. 90:) it is 
a corroborative particle; (I 'Ak, Mughnee;) a 
particle governing the subject in the accus. case 
and the predicate in the nom. case, (S, I 'Ak, 
Mughnee, K,) combining with what follows it to 
form an equivalent to an inf. n., (S,) [for,] accord, 
to the most correct opinion, it is a conjunct 
particle, which, together with its two objects of 
government, is explained by means of an inf. n. 
(Mughnee.) If the predicate is derived, the inf. n. 
by means of which it is explained is of the 
same radical letters; so that the implied meaning 
of jltitij till yjih [It has come to my knowledge, or 
been related to me, or been told to me, or it came 
to my knowledge, &c., that thou goest away], 
or till [that thou art going away], is yMll 
JilkiVI [or rather tiis!>lkl thy going away has come 
to my knowledge, &c.]; and hence, the implied 
meaning of jtill yl 411 ^4*1 [it has come to my 
knowledge, & c., that thou art in the house] is 
jtill 41 jl jSSkl [thy remaining in the house has 
come to my knowledge, &c.], because thea 
predicate is properly a word suppressed 
from jidl or and if the predicate is 

underived, the implied meaning is explained by 
the word u j% so that the implied meaning of ^tiill 
jj j Id ji [it has come to my knowledge, &c., that 
this is Zeyd] is tiij 1-jjS ^Mli [his being Zeyd has 
come to my knowledge, &c.]; for the relation of 
every predicate expressed by an underived 
word to its subject may be denoted by a word 
signifying “ being; ” so that you say, 1 j Ii* and, if 
you will, tiyj 0)11 Id; both signifying the same. 
(Mughnee.) There are cases in which either 4) 
or u! may be used: [see the latter, in twelve 
places:] other cases in which only the former may 
be used: and others in which only the latter. (I 
'Ak p. 91.) The former only may be used when the 
implied meaning is to be explained by an inf. n. (I 
'Ak, K.) Such is the case when it occurs in the 
place of a noun governed by a verb in the nom. 
case; as in j)l till [It pleases me that thou 

art standing], i. e. tiUUs [thy standing pleases me]: 
or in the place of a noun governed by a verb in 
the accus. case; as in j)l till tikjO [1 knew that 
thou wast standing], i. e. tiliUs [thy standing]: or 
in the place of a noun governed in the gen. case 
by a particle; as in jll till d“ ^ j> c [I wondered 
that thou wast standing], i. e. tiUUs ^ [at, or by 
reason of, thy standing]: (I 'Ak p. 91:) 

[and sometimes a preposition is understood; as 
in Id All 4Ii for lti£ A3 ^ tili V There is no doubt 
that it is thus, i. e. IAS <jj£ ^1 tili 1 There is no 
doubt of its being thus:] and Ol must be used 


after jl; as in 4041 jli 411 jl [if that thou wert 
standing, I had stood, or would have stood, i. e. jl 
4IAUS or ■—44 4IAUa jl ; accord, to 

different opinions, both meaning if thy standing 
were a fact: see I 'Ak pp. 305 and 306]. (K.) 
Sometimes its I is changed into £; so that you 
say, jli 3 " 4id cklt [meaning I knew that thou 

wast going away]. (M.) With til prefixed to 

it, it is a particle of comparison, (S, * M, TA,) 
[still] governing the subject in the accus. case and 
the predicate in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, Oil 
jjic tijj [it is as though Zeyd were 

'Amr], meaning that Zeyd is like 'Amr; as though 
you said, jj A»*£ 0)11 tijj j\ [verily, Zeyd is like 
'Amr]: [it is to be accounted for by an ellipsis: or] 
the til is taken away from the middle of this 
proposition, and put at its commencement, and 
then the kesreh of 0,! necessarily becomes 
changed to a fet-hah, because u! cannot be 
preceded by a preposition, for it never occurs but 
at the commencement [of a proposition]. (IJ, 
M.) Sometimes, Oil denotes denial; as in the 
saying, tijitia ti 4I1£ [As though thou wert our 
commander so that thou shouldst command 
us], meaning thou art not our commander [that 
thou shouldst command us]. (TA.) It also denotes 
wishing; as in the saying, Addi jAill tils tis ^ tiiilsj 
meaning Would that I had poetized, or versified, 
so that I might do it well: (TA:) [an elliptical form 
of speech, of which the implied meaning seems to 
be, would that I were as though thou sawest me 
that I had poetized, &c.; or the like: for] you say 
[also], tiL meaning til^ j-fyi [it is as 
though I saw thee]; i. e. I know from what 
I witness of thy condition to-day how thy 
condition will be tomorrow; so that it is as 
though I saw thee in that condition: (Har p. 126: 
[see also y; near the end of the paragraph:]) 
[thus,] also denotes knowing; and also 
thinking; [the former as in the saying 
immediately preceding, and] as when you say, 
itiia ti> ‘till [I know, or rather it appears, as 
though seen, that God does what He wills]; 
and [the latter as when you say,] jr J-i- tiLlS [1 
think, or rather it seems, that Thou art going 
forth]. (TA.) — — [When it has The 

affixed pronoun of the first person, sing. Or PI., 
you say, and ^i, and til and till; and When it 
has also the til of comparison prefixed to It,] you 
say, and [and till and H,] like as you 
say, Jll and [&c.]. (S.) — — As 3 is a 
derivative from u], it is correctly asserted by Z 
that tiui imports restriction, like J, tiul; both of 
which occur in the saying in the Kur [xxi. 
108], ti=>.lj Ail jSjJI titil _[ tiJ I [Say thou, It 

is only revealed to me that your God is only 



110 Digitized Text Version V 1.1 


[BOOKI.] 


one God]: the former is for the restricting of the 
quality to the qualified; and the latter, for the 
reverse: (Mughnee, K:) i. e. the former is for the 
restricting of the revelation to the declaration of 
the unity; and the latter, for the restricting of “ 
your God ” to unity: (Marginal note in a copy of 
the Mughnee:) hut these words of the Kur do not 
imply that nothing save the unity was revealed to 
the Prophet; for the restriction is limited to the 
case of the discourse with the believers in 
a plurality of gods; so that the meaning is, there 
has not been revealed to me [aught], respecting 
the godhead, except the unity; not the attribution 
of any associate to God. (Mughnee.) p-iil, 
however, does not always import restriction; nor 
does always even J, '^J : in each of these, 4 is what 
is termed AilS; i. e., it restricts the particle 
to which it is affixed from exercising any 
government; and sometimes has no effect upon 
the signification of that particle: (see art. and 
see '-“jj, below, voce j):) thus, for instance, in the 
Kurviii. 28, Alia Uil I I j means And know 
ye that your possessions and your children are a 
trial; not that they are only a trial. When it has 
the 4 of comparison prefixed to it, it is 
sometimes contracted; as in the following ex.:] a 
poet says, (jf. ^44. 4AS 

f Uill [As though, by reason of their mincing gait, 
they were walking upon tragacanthas; and they 
were laughing so as to discover teeth 

like hailstones: being for 4^4 . (IAar.) u 1 

is someTimes contracted into u'; (S, Mughnee;) 
and in This case, it governs in the manner already 
explained, voce uf (Mughnee.) — — It is also 
syn. with 0*1; (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K;) as in the 
saying, 4*4 U1 ^ jiiu .ilil Cyl [Come thou to 

the market; may-be thou wilt buy for 
us something; 4 jjI being originally j4]; i. e. 41x] : 
(Sb, M, Mughnee, K: *) and, accord, to some, (M, 
Mughnee, K,) so in the Kur [vi. 109], where it is 
said, V lit t$jl Uj [And what 

maketh you to know? (meaning, maketh you to 
know that they will believe when it cometh? i. e. 
ye do not know that: Jel:) Maybe, when it 
cometh, they will not believe]: (S, M, Mughnee, 
K:) thus accord, to this reading: (Mughnee, K:) 
and Ubei here reads 41*1. (s.) 0 and uV and 0 jl 
are all syn. with 0^ and 0*1; and ^11 and ^1, 
and and upl, and jl and jl, with 
and eO*!. (K voce 0*1.) — — It is also syn. 
with O*' [Yes, or yea; or it is as thou sayest]. (M, 
TA.) [See also u] as exemplified by a verse 
commencing with iM'j and by a saying of Ibn-Ez- 
Zubeyr.] u! is one of the particles which annul the 
quality of the inchoative, like O, of which it is the 
original: (I ’Ak p. 90:) it is a corroborative 
particle, (I 'Ak, Mughnee,) corroborating the 


predicate; (S, K;) governing the subject in the 
accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case; (S, 
I 'Ak, Mughnee, K;) [and may generally be 
rendered by Verily, or certainly, or the like; 
exactly agreeing with the Greek on, as used in 
Luke vii. 16 and in many other passages in the 
New Testament; though it often seems to be 
nothing more than a sign of inception, which can 
hardly be rendered at all in English; unless in 
pronunciation, by laying a stress upon the 
predicate, or upon the copula;] as in 
the saying, fill 14 j u! [Verily, or certainly, Zeyd is 
standing; or simply, Zeyd is standing, if we lay a 
stress upon standing, or upon is]. (I 'Ak p. 90.) 
But sometimes it governs both the subject and 
the predicate in the accus. case; as in the 
saying, j] 4laik ■ ^ Ls ^ CjlAla JAill .vi^l I jl 

lid 4LI ji. [when the darkness of night becomes, 
or shall become, intense, then do thou come, and 
let thy steps be light: verily our guardians are 
lions]; (Mughnee, K; [but in the latter, for 44l ; 
we find i jlol, so that the meaning is, when the 
first portion of the night becomes, or shall 
become, black, &c.;]) and as in a trad, in which it 
is said, 14 j* 5 u 1 [Verily the bottom of 
Hell is a distance of seventy years of journeying]: 
(Mughnee, K:) the verse, however, is explained 
by the supposition that it presents a denotative of 
state [in the last word, which is equivalent 
to liUkd or the like], and that the predicate is 
suppressed, the meaning being, 144 [thou 
wilt find them lions]; and the trad, by the 
supposition that j*A is an inf. n., and 0 j*- 4“ is an 
adverbial noun, so that the meaning is, the 
reaching the bottom of hell is [to be 
accomplished in no less time than] in 
seventy years. (Mughnee.) And sometimes the 
inchoative [of a proposition] after it is in the 
nom. case, and its subject is what is termed 

S

Mohammad, ujjj > i ~4 ‘ ' I “'-441 f j) 4IAA pAill lii jl 
[Verily, (the case is this:) of the men most 
severely to be punished, on the day of

*) and as in the saying in the Kur [xx. 66], j'Ab u! 
jl [accord, to some,] as will be seen in what 

follows. (TA.) Of the two particles u! and 

l d, in certain cases only the former may be 
used; and in certain other cases either of them 
may be used. (I' Ak p. 91.) The former must be 
used when it occurs inceptively, (Kh, T, I' Ak p. 
92, Mughnee, K,) having nothing before it upon 
which it is syntactically dependent, (Kh, T,) with 
respect to the wording or the meaning; (K;) as 
in I4j jl [Verily Zeyd is standing]. (I' Ak, K.) 
It is used after Vf, (I' Ak, K,) the 


inceptive particle, (I' Ak,) or the particle which is 
employed to give notice [of something about to 
be said]; (K;) as in 14 j u! VI [Now surely 

Zeyd is standing]. (I' Ak K.) And when it occurs at 
the commencement of the complement of a 
conjunct noun; (T Ak, K; *) as in Aj| ls4I aU.

Kur [xxviii. 76], Aj41 jl U j jjSJI j* JLiilj 

?j4l Jji <j-a*14 [And we gave him, of treasures, 
that whereof the keys would weigh down the 
company of men possessed of strength]. (I' Ak, * 
K, * TA.) And in the complement of an oath, (I' 
Ak, K,) when its predicate has J, (I' Ak,) or 
whether its subject or its predicate has J or has it 
not; (K;) as in I4j u! ^ j [By Allah, verily 
Zeyd is standing], (I' Ak,) and Aj| ; or, as some 
say, when you do not employ the J, the particle is 
with fet-h; as in 4LI ylll j | jjla [1 swear by Allah 
that thou art standing]; mentioned by Ks as thus 
heard by him from the Arabs: (TA:) but 
respecting this case we shall have to speak 
hereafter. (I' Ak.) And when it occurs after the 
word 3 ja or a derivative thereof, in repeating the 
saying to which that word relates; (Fr, T, I' Ak, * 
K; *) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 156], 41 j$Jja j 
Ty^dl IAS [And their saying, Verily we have slain

dial, of him who does not pronounce it with fet-h: 
(K:) but when it occurs in explaining what is said, 
you use j uj as in the saying, u 1 4*^ 411 cJa 4 

jjalc iSfly ^-4j4 4IUi [1 have said to thee a 
good saying; that thy father is noble and that

signifying “ saying ” is used as meaning 
“ thinking; ” as in 14 j u 1 J j4i [Dost thou say 

that Zeyd is standing?], meaning i>l*ii [Dost thou 
think?]. (I' Ak.) Also, when it occurs in a phrase 
denotative of state; (I' Ak;) [i. e.,] after 
the j denotative of state; (K;) as in J4 jA j Ajjj 

[I visited him, I verily having hope, or

And when it occurs before the J which suspends 
the grammatical government of a verb of the

the J is not in its predicate, you say, J, u'; as 
in fjia I4j u' uuk. [I knew that Zeyd was 
standing]. (F Ak.) And in the like of the saying in 
the Kur [ii. 171 ], 3^ ^ ^4411 ^ 3£1' Oil 

49 [And verily they who differ among themselves 
respecting the book are in an opposition remote 
from the truth]; because of the J [of inception] 
which occurs after it, in (Ks, A 'Obeyd:) the J 
of inception which occurs before the predicate 
of 0 ! should properly commence the sentence; 
so that fjlal 14 j 0 ! [Verily Zeyd is standing] should 
properly be 14 j 0^; but as the J is a 

corroborative and u! is a corroborative, 
they dislike putting two particles of the same 
meaning together, and therefore they put the J 
later, transferring it to the predicate: Mbr allows 
its being put before the predicate of [ o'; and thus 
it occurs in an unusual reading of the saying [in 
the Kur xxv. 22 ], jjKU] fs-ii V] [But they ate 
food]; but this is explained by the 
supposition that the J is here redundant: (F Ak p. 
95 :) this is the reading of Sa’eed Ibn-Jubeyr: 
others read, fUUI 3 &U 1 44 SfJ [but verily they ate 
food]: and u! [as well as J, o'] is used after the 
exceptive 'ij when it is not followed by the J [of 
inception]. (TA.) Also, When it occurs after Uui; 
as in 3“k4 14 j d! AiA 344! [Sit thou where Zeyd is 
sitting]. (F Ak p. 92 , and k) And after as 
in ji V ,4-:} 4 j 3=J- [Zeyd has fallen sick, 

so that verily they have no hope for him: 
whereas after a particle governing the gen. case, 
[i. e. a preposition,] you say, J. O'. (IHsh in De 

Sacy’s Anthol. Gr. Ar. P. 76 .) Either of these 

two forms may be used after I ij denoting a thing's 
happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; as in uA ji. 

J 0! ' jj* [I went forth, and lo, verily Zeyd was 
standing], and O' ' 4 ® 4 '4j [and lo, or at that 

present time, Zeyd's standing]; in which latter 
case, O' with its complement is [properly] an 
inchoative, and its enunciative is the implied 
meaning being, and at that present time was the 
standing of Zeyd: or it may be that the 
enunciative is suppressed, and that the implied 
meaning is, [and lo, or at that present time,] the 
standing of Zeyd was an event come to pass. (F 
Ak p. 93 .) Also, when occurring in the 
complement of an oath, if its enunciative is 
without J: (F Ak:) [see exs. given above:] or, as 
some say, only [ O' is used in this case. (TA.) Also, 
when occurring after ^-3 denoting the complement 
of a condition; as in £14- -31s ^4 ^ [He who 
cometh to me, verily he shall be treated with 
honour], and 30 j in which latter 

case. O' with its complement is an inchoative, and 
the enunciative is suppressed; the implied 
meaning being, honourable treatment of him 


shall be an event come to pass: or it may be an 
enunciative to an inchoative suppressed; the 
implied meaning being, his recompense shall be 
honourable treatment. (F Ak p. 94 .) Also, when 
occurring after an inchoative having the meaning 
of a saying, its enunciative being a saying, and 
the sayer being one; as in ull ,4) Jjall jA [The 
best saying is. Verily I praise God], and cr"' 4 -^4 
in which latter case, O' with its complement is 
an enunciative of 33 ; the implied meaning being, 
the best saying is the praising of God [or my 
praising of God]. (F Ak ubi supra.) You 
also say, jl 0141 [At thy service ! Verily 

praise belongeth to Thee! O God]; commencing 
[with 0 .|] a new proposition: and sometimes one 
says, l O'; meaning ^ A=JI 09 [because praise 
belongeth to Thee]. (Msb.) — — The cases in 
which 0! may not be used in the place of o' have 

been mentioned above, voce O'. [When it 

has the affixed pronoun of the first person, sing, 
or pi.,] you say, ^4! and ^j, (S,) and 4 and lAjJ, 
(TA,) like as you say and ^4^ [&c.]. (S.) 0 ! as 
a contraction of 4' 0 ! has been mentioned above, 
as occurring in the phrase 4-3 qL voce 0.', q. v. — 
— Accord, to the grammarians, (T,) Ui| is a 
compound of 0 ! and Ii, (T, S,) which latter 
prevents the former's having any government: 
(T:) it imports restriction; like 1-31, which see 
above, voce O', in three places: (Mughnee, K:) [i. 
e.] it imports the restriction of that which it 
precedes to that which follows it; as in 4 j Ujl 
34-“ [Zeyd is only going away], and 3 A 4 l"! 

[Only Zeyd goes away]: (Bd in ii. 10 :) [in other 
words,] it is used to particularize, or specify, or 
distinguish a thing from other things: (S:) it 
affirms a thing in relation to that which is 
mentioned after it, and denies it in relation to 
other things; (T, S;) as in the saying in the Kur 
[ix. 60 ], lAl [The contributions 

levied for pious uses are only, or but, for the 
poor]: (S:) but El- Amidee and AHei say that it 
does not import restriction, but only 
corroboration of an affirmation, because it is a 
compound of the corroborative u! and 
the redundant l* which restrains the former from 
exercising government, and that it has no 
application to denote negation implied in 
restriction, as is shown by the trad., 3 4jll ,J 4 I 
3441 [which must mean, Verily usury is in the 
delay of payment], for usury is in other things 
beside that here mentioned, as JAill 4j [or profit 
obtained by the superior value of a thing received 
over that of a thing given], by common consent: 
(Kull p. 76 :) some say that it necessarily imports 
restriction: J says what has been cited above 
from the S: some say that it has an overt 


signification in denoting restriction, and is 
susceptible of the meaning of corroboration: 
some say the reverse of this: El-Amidee says that 
if it were [properly] restrictive, its occurrence in 
another sense would be at variance with the 
original import; but to this it may be replied, that 
if it were [properly] corroborative, its occurrence 
in another sense would be at variance with the 
original import: it [therefore] seems that it is 
susceptible of both these meanings, bearing one 
or the other according as this or that suits the 
place. (Msb.) Ujl is to be distinguished from u] 
with the conjunct [noun] U, which does not 
restrain it from governing [though its 
government with this is not apparent, and which 
is written separately]; as in 3-=“- 43. U j] 
meaning Verily what is with thee is good, and 
in 0*-=“- A d! meaning Verily thy deed is good. 
(F Ak pp. 97 and 98 .) — — 3! is 

sometimes contracted into u!; (S, Mughnee, K;) 
and in this case, it is made to govern and is made 
to have no government: (S:) it is seldom made 
to govern in this case; often made to have no 
government: the Koofees say that it is not 
contracted; (Mughnee, K;) and that when one 
says, 3^14 4 j u! [the meaning is virtually Verily 
Zeyd is going away, but] u! is a negative and the J 
is syn. with 'ij; but this assertion is refuted by 
the fact that some make it to govern when 
contracted, as in exs. cited above, voce u], q. v. 

(Mughnee.) It is also syn. with fd [Even so; 

yes; yea]; (Mughnee, K;) contr. to the opinion of 
AO. (Mughnee.) [See also 3 ', last sentence.] 
Those who affirm it to have this meaning cite as 
an ex. the following verse (Mughnee, K *) of 
'Obeyd-Allah Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyat: (S, * TA:) 4 
Ac- is cc 3143 <jj cj j4“ js j [And they say, 

(namely, the women,) Hoariness hath come upon 
thee, and thou hast become old: and I say, Even 
so, or yes, or yea]: (Mughnee, K:) but this has 
been rebutted by the saying, We do not concede 
that the » is here added to denote the pause, but 
assert that it is a pronoun, governed by u! in the 
accus. case, and the predicate is suppressed; 
the meaning being, 4]j£ 3l [Verily it, i. e. the case, 
is thus]. (Mughnee.) [J says,] The meaning is, 3l 
3)14 US jlS ia [Verily it, i. e. the case, hath been as 
ye say]: A 'Obeyd says, This is a curtailment of 
the speech of the Arabs; the pronoun being 
deemed sufficient because the meaning is known: 
and as to the saying of Akh, that it signifies 
he only means thereby that it may be so 
rendered, not that it is originally applied to that 
signification: he says that the » is here added 
to denote the pause. (S.) There is, however, a 
good ex. of u! in the sense of in the saying of

[BOOKI.] 


Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, to him who said to him, “May 
God curse a she camel which carried me to 
thee,” jj gt ; i. e. Even so, or yes, or yea; and 
may God curse her rider: for the suppression of 
both the subject and the predicate is not 
allowable. (Mughnee.) And hence, accord, to 
Mbr, the saying in the Kur [xx. 66], as thus 
read, O 1 ^ 4 Oj [meaning, if so, Yes, these 

two are enchanters]. (Mughnee.) [But this phrase 
has given rise to much discussion, related in the 
Mughnee and other works. The following is a 
brief abstract of what has been said respecting it 
by several of the leading authorities.] A bools- 
hak says that the people of El-Medeeneh and El- 
Koofeh read as above, except 'Asim, who is 
reported to have read, o' 3* Oj, without tesh-deed, 
and so is Kh; [so too is Hafs, as is said above, 
voce Oj;] and that AA read Ow- 14 Oj, the former 
word with teshdeed, and the latter in the accus. 
case: that the argument for o' 3* Oj, with teshdeed 
and the nom. case, [or rather what is identical in 
form with the nom. case,] is, that it is of the dial, 
of Kinaneh, in which the dual is formed by the 
termination O' in the nom. and accus. and gen. 
cases alike, as also in the dial, of Benu-l-Harith 
Ibn-Kaab: but that the old grammarians say 
that » is here suppressed; the meaning being, <3j 
g'3 4 : (T:) this last assertion, however, is weak; for 
what is applied to the purpose of 
corroboration should not be suppressed, and the 
instances of its suppression which have been 
heard are deviations from general usage, except 
in the case of O', with fet-h, contracted into O': 
(Mughnee:) Aboo-Is-hak then adds, that some 
say, Oj is here syn. with this last opinion he 
holds to be the best; the meaning being, O'- 14 

U41 [Yes, these two, verily they are two 
enchanters: for this is not a case in which 
the J (which is the J of inception) can be 
regarded as transferred from its proper place, at 
the commencement of the sentence or 
proposition, as it is in some instances mentioned 
in the former half of this paragraph: but it is said 
in the Mughnee that this explanation is 
invalidated by the fact that the combining of the 
corroborative J and the suppression of the 
inchoative is like the combining of two things 
inconsistent, or incompatible; as is also the 
opinion that the J is redundant, because the 
redundant J prefixed to the enunciative is 
peculiar to poetry]: next in point of goodness, in 
the opinion of A bools-hak, is, that it is of the 
dial, of Kinaneh and Benu-l-Harith Ibn-Kaab: the 
reading of AA he does not allow, because it is at 
variance with the written text: but he approves 
the reading of 'Asim and Kh. (T.) — Oj also 
occurs as a verb: it is the third person pi. fern, of

an epithet applied to anything of that sex or

termed ^33 from the phrase dtuji 3), q. v, because 
of her softness; she being more soft than a man: 


(M, L:) [but see the observation at the end of the 
first paragraph of this art.:] the pi. is 313; (T, S, 
M, A, Msb, K;) and sometimes one says 3±il ; as 
though it were pi. of ■— itiG (S;) or it is [truly] pi. 
of 313, like as 3^ is of 3'-“3 (T;) and ^lii, (t, a,

perfect woman; (T, A, K;) a woman being thus 
termed in praise; like as a man is termed 3 ^ 33. j. 

(T, A.) [The pi.] 313 also signifies (assumed 

tropical:) Inanimate things; (Lh, T, M, K;) as 
trees and stones (T, K) and wood. (T.) In 
the passage of the Kur mentioned above, 133 is 
said to have this meaning: (T, M:) [or it there 
means females; for] Fr says that El-Lat and El- 
'Ozza and the like were said by the Arabs to be 

feminine divinities. (T, TA.) Also (assumed 

tropical:) Small stars. (K.) — — And [the 
dual] (tropical:) The two testicles;

(assumed tropical:) The inner parts (03)33) of 

the thighs of the horse. (M, L.) And is 

also used to signify (assumed tropical:)

related that a party of the jinn, or genii, came to a 
company of men, and asked permission to go 
in to them, whereupon the latter said to them. 
Who are ye? and they answered, 0=41 0* 5=4 [A

customary for men, when it is said to them, Who

observed that 3===jj is more probably the dim. 
of 414 j:] some say that it is from 5=4=1, signifying 
“perception,” or “sight,” and “knowledge,” and 
“sensation;” because man uses these faculties: 
(TA:) and Mohammad Ibn-'Arafeh El-Wasitee 
says that men are called uj 3“4 because they are 
seen (Oj==Jm, i. e. Ojla), and that the jinn are 
called 0?- because they are [ordinarily] concealed

[it is said in the B, as cited in the TA, that the 
form 04=*=i is also used for 6)4=4; as though it were 
a dual, meaning “a double associate,” i. e., an 
associate with the jinn and with his own kind; for 
it is added, 34=44 i_>=4j 0=444 5=4:] some derive 
the word from 5=5-1, signifying “motion:” (TA:)

originally =1, (S, Msb, TA,) of the 

measure (S, Msb,) from 014411 

[“forgetfulness”], (Msb,) and contracted to make 


it more easy of pronunciation, because of its 
being so often used; (S;) but it is restored to its 
original in forming the dim., (S, Msb,) which 
is (Msb, TA:) this form of the dim., they 

say, shows the original form of the word which is 
its source; (TA;) and they adduce as an indication 
of its derivation the saying of TAb, 4U-I 36= Uil 
ls— 4 4*11 4= =jV [He (meaning the first man) was

authors have ascribed meanings amounting to 
twelve: (Mughnee:) a particle which, when 
occurring in an enunciative phrase, [generally] 
denotes doubt, and vagueness of meaning; and 
when occurring in an imperative or a prohibitive 
phrase, [generally] denotes the giving of option, 
or choice, and the allowing a thing, or making 
it allowable. (S.) — — First, (Mughnee,) it 
denotes doubt. (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in 
the saying, 1^3 jl kyj [I sawZeyd or 'Amr]. 
(T, * S, Msh.) And J 3*j ^3. [A man or a 
woman came to me]. (Mbr, T.) And jl *jl 1%1 
gji (_3*j [in the Kur xviii. 18 and xxiii. 115 , We 
have remained a day or part of a day]. 
(Mughnee.) — — Secondly, (Mughnee,) it 
denotes vagueness of meaning. (S, Msb, 
Mughnee, K.) S [it may he used] in the first of the 
.exs. given above. (Msb.) And so in the saying, *3 
0*3 3Y-*= ^ jl c?l* j 1 [And verily we or 

ye are following a right direction or in manifest 
error], (S, Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxiv. 23 ]; (S;) 

the ex. being in the former jl (Mughnee.) 

Thirdly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the giving of 
option, or choice. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) So in 
the saying, OP 3 -A3JI [Eat thou the 

fish, or drink thou the milk]; i. e. do not 
thou both of these actions; (Mbr, T, S;) hut 
choose which of them thou wilt. (Mbr, T.) 
And 331 jl li* j3j< [Take thou as wife Hind or 
her sister]. (Mughnee.) And [in like manner] it 
denotes the making choice. (T.) [So when you 
say, 331 31 'l* £ 3 jll*, meaning I will take as wife 
Hind or her sister; whichever of them I choose.] 


— — Fourthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes the 
allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (T, S, 
Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, ji 0“3 pJ3 
33 [Sit thou with El- Hasan or Ibn- 
Seereen]. (Mbr, T, S.) And 3*31 J [Stand thou or 
sit]: and the person to whom this is said may do 
[one or] both of the se actions. (Msb.) [And 
similar exs. are given in the Mughnee.]) But Y 3 
I jji£ ji Uul ,3* [; n the Kur lxxvi. 24 , And obey 

not thou, of them, a sinner or a person very 
ungrateful to God,] means that thou shalt 
not obey either of such persons: (Mbr, T, 
Mughnee:) in which case 3 is more forcible 
than j; for when you say to a person, jij Y 
3 [Obey not thou Zeyd and 'Amr], he may 
obey one of them, since the command is that he 
shall not obey the two. (Zj, T.) — — Fifthly, 
(Mughnee,) it denotes unrestricted conjunction. 
(Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, in the Kur [iv. 46 
andv. 9 ], -3311 0 ? oJ iU. 31 [And if any one of 
you cometh from the privy]; (TA;) [where, 
however, it may also be rendered or, though] 
meaning *33; (T, TA;) the j in this explanation 
being what is termed a denotative of state. (T.) 
So, too, accord, to AZ, in the expression Oj*l« 3 1 
[And they exceeded that number], in the 
Kur [xxxvii. 147 ]: hut see below. (TA.) And so in 
the words, 333 3 Ull jil 3*3 0 1 3' [And our 

doing, in respect of our possessions, what 

we will], in the Kur [xi. 89 ]. (T, TA.) Sixthly, 

it denotes transition, (Mughnee,) used in the 
sense of [the adversative particle] 3), (T, S, M, 
Mughnee, K,) in a case of amplification of speech; 
(S;) accord, to Sb, on two conditions; that it shall 
be preceded by a negation or a prohibition, and 
that the agent shall be mentioned a second time; 
as in f 1 * 3 31 li [Zeyd did not stand: 

nay, rather 'Amr did not stand]; and Y 3 1 3 Y 

j 3*^ [Let not Zeyd stand: nay, rather let not 

'Amr stand]. (Mughnee.) Accord, to Fr, (Th, M, 
Mughnee,) it has this meaning in Oj*l« 3 1 [Nay, 
rather they exceeded that number], (Th, S, M, 
Mughnee,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 147 , cited above]: 
(S:) or the meaning is, or they would exceed [that 
number] in your estimation: or these words with 
those preceding them in the same verse mean, we 
sent him to a multitude of whom, if ye saw them, 
ye would say, They are a hundred thousand, or 
they exceed [that number]; (M, Mughnee; *) so 
that it denotes doubt on the part of men, not of 
God, for He is not subject to doubt: (M:) or we 
sent him to a hundred thousand in the estimation 
of men, or they exceeded [that number] in the 
estimation of men; for God does not doubt: (S:) 
or jl is here used to denote vagueness of 
meaning: (IB, Mughnee:) or, it is said, to denote 



124 Digitized Text Version V 1.1 


[BOOKI.] 


that a person might choose between saying, “they 
are a hundred thousand," and saying, “they are 
more;“ but this may not be when one of the two 
things is the fact: or, accord, to some of the 
Koofees, it has the meaning of j: and each of 
these meanings, except the last, has been 
assigned to jl as occurring in the Kur ii. 69 and 
xvi. 79 . (Mughnee.) — — Seventhly, it denotes 
division; (Mughnee, K; *) as in the saying, S-4S1I 
l -* jl jl f“l [The word is a noun or a verb or 
a particle]: so said Ibn-Malik: or, as he 
afterwards said, in preference, it denotes 
separation (jjj“I) divested of the attribute of 
denoting doubt and vagueness of meaning and 
the giving of option or choice; adducing as one of 
his exs. of this meaning the saying, 14 j* I >jS I jllaj 
^ jUaj jl [i n the Kur ii. 129 , And they said, “Be ye 
Jews” or “Christians”]; because the use of j in 
division is better; as when you say, 3*3j f4l <4ill 
j^j: or it denotes, accord, to some, distinction 
(J u-^H ); and the meaning of the ex. last cited, 
say they, is, and the Jews said, “Be ye Jews,” and 
the Christians said, “Be ye Christians.” 
(Mughnee.) It is [said to be] used in this last 
sense (that of J >>»iH I) in the saying, jkill JSI Cu£ 
ill^l jl [I used to eat flesh-meat or honey]; i. e. I 
used to eat flesh-meat one time and honey 
another time: and so in the Kur vii. 3 and x. 13 . — 
— Eighthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of 
the exceptive % (Mughnee, K,) or 3 X! (M;) and 
in this case the aor. after it is mansoob, because 
of 3 suppressed. (Mughnee, K.) So in 
the saying, ji-4 jl -C13V [I will assuredly slay him 
or he shall become a Muslim; i. e., unless he 
become a Muslim]. (Mughnee. [And a similar 
ex. is given in the M.]) So, too, in the saying, 4 ±S j 
Laj£jjjj jl di j — S. ^j 2 sua 111 [And I used, 

when I pinched and pressed the spear of 
a people, to break its knots, or joints, or its 
internodal portions, (the shaft being a cane,) or, 
i. e. unless, it became straight]: (Mughnee, K: *) a 
prov., of which the author is Ziyad ElAajam; 
meaning, when a people behaved with hardness 
to me, I endeavoured to soften them: (TA in 
art. _>=■:) thus related by Sb, the verb ending it 
being rendered mansoob by jl; and thus he heard 
it from some one or more of the Arabs; but in 
the original verses, which are but three, it is jjC j 
with refa. (IB and TA in art. [And similar to 
these above are the sayings,] <J=. Ji Co jl ill 

[Verily it belongs to such a one or there is not, i. 
e. unless there be not, in Nejd, a <kja (see 
art. -!=> j3)]: and <3=js ■44 C jl 4£uV [I will assuredly 
come to thee or there is not, i. e. unless there be 
not, in Nejd, a <4>ja]; meaning I will assuredly 
come to thee, in truth. (T.) — — Ninthly, 
(Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of Jj, 


(Mughnee, K,) or J J!; (S;) in which case also 
the aor. after it is mansoob, because of u 1 
suppressed: (Mughnee:) and in the sense 

of JA [which is also syn. with (jjJ], (Fr, T, M, K.) 
So in the saying, ji - 40 -aV [I will assuredly 
beat him until he repent]. (S. [And similar exs. 
of jl as explained by are given in the T (from 
Fr) and in the M and in the Mughnee.]) And so in 
the saying of the poet, ^441 41 jil ji m*- 4JI j lgl . ’s . i V 
VI JCV I Cjjliil Us [1 win assuredly deem easy 
what is difficult until I attain the objects of wish; 
for hopes become not easy of accomplishment 
save to one who is patient]. (Mughnee.) — — 
Tenthly, some say, (Mughnee,) it denotes 
nearness [of one event or thing to another]; as in 
the saying, £->j ji ji4l is _pl C [I know not 
whether he saluted or bade farewell]: (Mughnee, 
K: [but in the CK this ex. is misplaced:]) this, 
however, is manifestly wrong; jl being here used 
to denote doubt, and the denoting of nearness 
being only inferred from the fact of the saluting 
being confounded in the mind with the 
bidding farewell, since this is impossible or 
improbable when the two times are far apart. 
(Mughnee.) — — Eleventhly, (Mughnee,) it 
occurs as a conditional, (T, Mughnee, K,) accord, 
to Ks alone; (T;) or rather as a conjunctive and 
conditional; o\ j being meant to be understood in 
its place; though in truth the verb that precedes it 
indicates that the conditional particle [uD is 
meant to be understood [before that verb], and jl 
retains its proper character, but forms part of 
that which has a conditional meaning because 
conjoined with a preceding conditional phrase. 
(Mughnee.) So in the saying, uU jl jilt <uj4=V, 
(Mughnee, K,) i. e., uU jl 3 yjikJI 3*3 jAi. jl [i 
will assuredly beat him if he live (after the 
beating) or if he die]: so says Ibn-Esh-Shejeree. 

(Mughnee.) Twelfthly, accord, to Ibn-Esh- 

Shejeree, on the authority of some one or more of 
the Koofees, (Mughnee,) it denotes division into 
parts, or portions; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 
129 , before cited,] ls'J 44 j' l4j* Iji^j, 

(Mughnee, K,) i. e. And they said, “Be ye, some 
of you, Jews, and, some of you, Christians:” (TA:) 
but [IHsh says,] it appears to me that the 
meaning here is that of J j-^ll' l mentioned 

before. (Mughnee.) [In the K it is said to 

occur also in the sense of o': but this is evidently 
a mistake, app. originating in one of the 
two principal sources of the K, namely, the M, in 
which the same is said, but is exemplified by a 
phrase in which it is explained by u 1 X, the eighth 

of the meanings of jl mentioned above.] See 

also ji below, jl in Ijjj jl jl &c. is [the 
conjunction] j with the interrogative I prefixed to 
it. (Fr, T.) l4£ j« jl (T, M) and ji (M) [Alas, on 


account of, or for, such a thing!] an expression 
denoting complaint of distress, or of anxiety, or 
of grief or sorrow; (T;) or an expression of grief 
or sorrow; (M;) like j ji and J, ji and ) »l3jl (K and 
TA in art. » jl,) or [ 4ji (CK in that art.,) or [ »ljji, 
or l Ajji, (S in that art., [the » in one copy of 
which is marked as quiescent,]) and like ?i and ?jl 
&c. (S and Msb and K in art. » jk see ?i in that art.) 
AZ says, one says, ?jl [meaning Alas, 

for Zeyd!] with kesr to the », and 14 ji j, -iljlc [thus 
without », meaning Alas, for thee!] with cii; an 
expression of regret for a thing, whether of great 
or mean account. (T.) ji The word J, ji when 
made a noun. (T, K.) So say the grammarians. 
(T.) You say, 4**jl »3 a [This is a good ji]. (T.) 
And to one who uses the phrase '14 ji I3£ J*ii, (T,) 
you say, '4'-=>.jVI ^3 [Let thou, or leave thou, the 
word jl alone]. (T, K.) »jl [A moaning (see its 
syn. <ii in art. »jl)] is said by some to be of 
the measure in which the » is the sign of the 
fem. gender; for they say, 4fiji [1 heard thy 
moaning], making it 4 j : and so says Lth; »jl is 
after the manner of 4i*a: (T:) you say, 411 s jl [May 
God cause moaning to thee!], (Lth, T, and S in 
art. » jl,) and 411 <il; [but accord, to J, the former 
of these is cognate with the latter; for he says 
that] the former is with the » suppressed, and 
with teshdeed to the j. (S in art. »jt, where 
see <*k) — — 4 lilc 4 ji ; and »4ji, or jl, 
or »l2jl, or »4jl: see '4S j* jl. Sjl i. q. <) 4 l 3 [A

one of the strangest of the things transmitted 
from the Arabs; the regular form being lSj',

above in the saying of the Arabs, 0? sjl VI > U

And < 4 ! 6' People came to him from 

every direction, or quarter. (TA, from a trad.) The 
poet Saideh Ibn-El-'Ajlan uses the 
expression, 66 meaning A thin sword 
would have come to thee; in which the verb may 
be trans. by itself, or the prep. may 

be understood. (M, TA.) He returned from 

disobedience to obedience; he repented. (TA.) 
And Jj 6' He returned unto God from his sin, 

or offence, and repented. (Msb.) <J] <; 6 He 

made him to return to him, or it; as also <61 j. < 4 !. 
(M.) And <46 6! 6 6, (as in a copy of the T,) 
or ( as in a copy of the A, [which is probably 
here the more correct],) He put back his hand to

his bow] to draw it: and <6“ 6' [to his arrow] to

He repeated, or echoed, the praises of God: 

thus in the saying [in the Kur xxxiv. to], 4 
O <*^ 64 J6* mountains, repeat ye, or echo ye, 
the praises of God with him; [i. e., with David;] 
(S, * M, TA;) but some read ^j' J, <«•*, meaning 
return ye with him in praising as often as he 
returneth therein: (M, TA:) or, accord, to the 
former reading, the meaning is, o 
mountains, labour ye with him in praising God 

all the day, until the night: (T:) for 6)', (T, 

A,) inf. n. 66, (T, A, K) also signifies It 
(a company of men) journeyed by day: (Aboo-

explanation in the M and K be meant to denote 
three distinct meanings, which I do not think to

authorities, they differ: (TA:) [Az says,] accord, to 
Ahmad Ibn-Yahya, these two words and ^4** are 
all one: but JjjIj seems to me to signify 
the collecting the meanings of dubious 
expressions by such expression as is clear, or 
plain, without dubiousness: or, accord, to Lth, it 
is the interpreting of language that has different 
meanings; and this cannot be rightly done but by 
an explanation which changes the expression; as 
also [ 3j4: (T:) or the turning a verse of the Kur- 
an from its apparent meaning to a meaning 
which it bears, or admits, when the latter 
is agreeable with the Scripture and the Sunneh: 
for instance, in the words of the Kur [vi. 95, 
&c.], cjiJI 0-* 4*3 c -44, if the meaning be 
[thus explained] “He produceth the bird from the 
egg,” this is and if [it be explained as 

meaning] “He produceth the believer from 
the unbeliever,” or “the knowing from the 
ignorant,” this is JjJ*: so says Ibn-El-Kemal: 
(TA:) [hence, although it may often be rendered 
by interpretation, like it more properly 

signifies the rendering in a manner not according 
to the letter, or overt sense; explaining the covert, 
or virtual, meaning; interpreting in a manner not 
according to the obvious meaning:] or the 
reducing a thing to its ultimate intent, whether it 
be a saying or an action: (Er-Raghib, TA:) or 
signifies the “discovering, detecting, revealing, or 
disclosing, what is meant by a dubious 
expression;” and 3 jj1j, the reducing one of two 
senses, or interpretations, which an expression 
bears, or admits, to that which suits the apparent 
meaning: (L and K in art. and TA in that and 
in the present art.:) or the former signifies the 
“expounding, explaining, or interpreting, the 
narratives which occur collected 
without discrimination in the Kur-an, and 


making known the significations of the strange 
words or expressions, and explaining the 
occasions on which the verses were revealed;” 
and the latter, the explaining the meaning of that 
which is <4iii ; [or what is equivocal, or 
ambiguous,] i. e., what is not understood without 
repeated consideration. (TA: [in which are some 
further explanations; but these add nothing of 

importance.]) [Hence, 3=4 Jji, i n grammar,

final sequel, or result, thereof: (M, K:) as in the 

Kur xii. 101. (M.) It is also used [as a simple

originally 3ja]: so say some: (Msb:) or it is 
originally 3*5, (T, M, Msb, K,) then 355, and 
then 31; (K:) so say some, arguing thus from its

(TA:) or that which one sees in the first part of 
the day, and in the last part thereof, as though 
raising figures seen from a distance (a - 3 .j 33 - 3 ); not 
the same as the s 3 ' x (S:) or what resembles 
the *-A >■“: (Msb:) or, as some say, that which is in 
the ur 3 - 33 [or early part of the day when the sun 
is yet low], like water between the sky and the 
earth, [in appearance] raising figures seen from a 
distance (u-=> j 3 - 3 ), and making them to 
quiver; whereas the s 3 ' j 33 is that which is at mid- 
day, [apparently] cleaving to the ground, as 
though it were running water: Th says, the Jt is in 
the first part of the day: (M:) As says that the Jt 
and the m' j 33 are one: but others say that the 
former is from the ur 3 - 333 [see above] to 
the declining of the sun from the meridian; 
whereas the s 3 ' j 33 is after the declining of the sun 
from the meridian to the prayer of the A- 33 - ; and 
in favour of their assertion they urge, that the 
former [in appearance] raises everything so that 
it becomes what is termed Jt, i. e. for the Jt 

of everything is its u- 33 ^ 3 ; and that the s 3 ' j 33 [in 
appearance] lowers every u 3333 ^ in it so that it 
becomes [as though it were] cleaving to the 
ground, having no o- 33 - 3 : Yoo says, the Arabs say 
that the Jt is from the SjJc. [or period between the 
prayer of daybreak and sunrise] to the time when 
the sun is very high, or near the meridian; then it 
is called s 3 ' j 33 for the rest of the day: ISk says, 


the Jt is that which [in appearance] raises figures

[explained above]; and the m' j 33 is that which is 
upon the surface of the ground, as though it were 
water, and is at midday: and this, I [namely Az] 
say, is what I have found the Arabs in the desert 
to say: (T:) El- Hareeree speaks of the glistening

inversion; the meaning being JYI Aijj 
[The Jt raising it]: (S, TA:) or the meaning is, 
making the Jt conspicuous more than it would 
otherwise be; the agent of the verb being a 
prominent portion of a mountain, which, being 
itself raised [in appearance] by the Jt, has the 
effect of doing this. (M.) — See also the

good degree, and changed in its flavour: (AHat,

assigned in the M to 3ljJ;] in which milk thickens:

the 3jlji [pi. of 3jJ]; and so says AA: but 
AHeyth says that this is absurd; and that the 
right word is [ 3jl, having the signification first 
explained in this paragraph, i. e. thickening, 
or thick, milk: En-Nadr says that J, 3j] signifies 
thick urine of she-goats of the mountain; which, 
when drunk by a woman, excites her 
venereal faculty: (T:) or this last word is used to 
signify milk of an 3jJ, which is said to strengthen 
in the venereal faculty, and to fatten, as Ibn- 
Habeeb asserts; and [ 3jl, which he affirms to be 
wrong, is a dial. var. thereof; and it may also be a

used in addressing one who is between near and

follows it is an adjunct explicative of 
what precedes it, or a substitute. (Mughnee.) AA 
says that he asked Mbr respecting what follows it, 



[BOOKI.]

and he answered that it may be a substitute for 
what precedes, and may be a word independent 
of what precedes it, and may be a noun in the 
accus. case: and that he asked Th, and 
he answered that it may be an explicative, or a 
word independent of what precedes it, or a noun 
governed in the accus. case by a verb 
suppressed: you say, 3 j O' ^ ji.i [Thy 

brother came to me; that is, Zeyd]; and you may 
say, '3 j Is'' [I mean Zeyd]: and '3j O' ■— 4V 3 [I 

saw thy brother; I mean, or that is, Zeyd]; and 
you may say, 3j O' [that is, Zeyd]: and cjj 
fjj is'' -433 [I passed by thy brother; that is, 
by Zeyd]; and you may say, 13 j O' [i mean, 
Zeyd]; and 3j "J\ [that is, Zeyd]. (T, TA.) When it 
occurs after J j3, in a case like the following, [i. e., 
when a verb following it explains a verb 
preceding it,] one says, 3lU» is ' -dOSukl J Ju 

AiUS [Thou sayest, meaning ■'33; 

■utuS i asked of him the concealment of

when 33 is understood, as is often, or generally, 
the case in lexicons]; with damm to the but 
if you put lij in the place of is', you say, *313, lit, 
with fet-h, because 31 j s a n adverbial noun 
relating to 33. (Mughnee.) — See also si near 
the beginning of the paragraph, in three 
places. is\ is a particle denoting a reply, 
meaning 3 [Yes, or yea]; importing 
acknowledgment of the truth of an enunciation; 
and the making a thing known, to him who asks 
information; and a promise, to him who seeks or 
demands; therefore it occurs after such sayings 
as “Zeyd stood” and “Did Zeyd stand.?” and “Beat 
thou Zeyd,” and the like; as does 3 : Ibn-El-Hajib 
asserts that it occurs only after an interrogation; 
as in the saying [in the Kur x. 54], > ^330 

isjjj is l 3s [And they will ask thee to 
inform them, saying, Is it true? Say, Yea, by my 
Lord!]: but accord, to all, it does not occur 
otherwise than before an oath: and when one 
says, 30 is j [Yea, by God!], and then drops the j 
the s may be quiescent, and with fet-h, and 
elided; [so that you say, -dll is ], and dll is 
and dll 1;] in the first of which cases, two 
quiescent letters occur together, irregularly. 
(Mughnee.) Lth says, is J is an oath, as 
in isO ! meaning, says Zj, 3 jj IAar is 

also related to have said the like; and this is the 
correct explanation. (T.) [J says,] It is a 
word preceding an oath, meaning 3 [q. v.]; as 
in c?; jj is ] and -dll j is ]. (S.) [ISd and F say,] It is 
syn. with and is conjoined with an oath: and 
one says also 3*. (M, K.) is'' is a noun, used in five 
different manners. (Mughnee.) One of its 
meanings is that of an interrogative, (T, S, M, 


Mughnee, K,) relating to intellectual beings and 
to non-intellectual things; [meaning Who? 
which? and what?] (S, M, K;) and as such, it is a 
decl. noun: (S:) it is said in the K to be a 
particle; (MF;) and so in the M; (TA;) but this is 
wrong: (MF:) and it is added in the K that it is 
indecl.; (MF;) and it is said to be so in the 
M, accord, to Sb, in an instance to be explained 
below; (TA;) but this is only when it is a conjunct 
noun [like 3'], or denotes the object of 
a vocative: (MF:) or, accord, to some, it is decl. as 
a conjunct noun also. (Mughnee.) You say, f«”' 
33 [Who, or which, of them, is thy brother?]. 
(S.) Another ex. is the saying [in the Kur vii. 184, 
and last verse of lxxvii.], 03i« “3 33 [And 

in what announcement, after it, will they 
believe?]. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it is 
without teshdeed; as in the saying (of El- 
Farezdak, M), J, 0-? di 

i jL'3 ciuill [1 looked for rain, or aid from 

the clouds, and the two Simaks (stars so called). 
Of which of them two did the rains pour 
vehemently upon me from the clouds?]: (M, 
Mughnee, K: * [in the last of which, only the 
former hemistich is given, with '3“ (meaning the 
star or asterism so called) instead of '>-=“:]) so by 
poetic licence: (M:) IJ says that for this reason 
the poet has elided the second s, but should have 
restored the first s to j, because it is originally j. 
(TA. [But this assertion, respecting the first s, I 
regard as improbable.]) J, 3k also, is a contraction 
of 3 O', meaning fO-i ls': so in the saying, 3 > 3 
[What thing is it, O such a one?]: and 33 3 
[What thing sayest thou?]. (TA in art. 30 In like 
manner, also, [ 03' is used as a contraction of is'' 
fiA (Ks, TA in art. j* j=>-.) A poet speaks of his 
companions as being Ldj'j 03 ; making is'' the 
name of the quarter (<s-?0; so that, being 
determinate and of the feminine gender, it is 
imperfectly declinable. (M. [See of; under which 
head two other readings are given; and where it 
is said that the verse in which this occurs is by 
Homeyd Ibn-Thowr.]) is 1 ' is never without a noun 
or pronoun to which it is prefixed, except in a 
vocative expression and when it is made to 
conform with a word to which it refers, as in 
cases to be exemplified hereafter. (Mughnee.) 
Being so prefixed, it is determinate; but 
sometimes, [as in the latter of the cases 
just mentioned,] it is not so prefixed, yet has the 
meaning of a prefixed noun. (S.) When used as 
an interrogative, it is not governed, as to 
the letter, though it is as to the meaning, by the 
verb that precedes it, but by what follows it; as in 
the saying in the Kur [xviii. 11], uSjpJI s' A*3 
[That we might know which of the two 


parties was able to compute]; and in the same 
[xxvi. last verse], 0 j 33 ylaii O' I jilt 3*3 j 

[And they who have acted wrongly shall know 
with what a translating they shall be translated]: 
(Fr, * Th, Mbr, T, S: *) when it is governed by the 
verb before it, it has not the interrogative 
meaning, as will be shown hereafter. (Fr, T.) In 
the saying of the poet, is'' j 31 j jj 3ii. 0 
-UU1 jijVI [Haneefeh (the tribe so named) 
shout to us when they see us. And to what place 
of the earth, or land, will they go for the 
shouting?], is'' is in the accus. case because the 
prep. J] is suppressed before it. (S.) When they 
separate it [from what follows it, not prefixing it 
to another noun], the Arabs say s', and in the 
dual u3k and in the pi. uji; and they make it 
fern., saying and [in the dual] 33', and [in the 
pi.] : but when they prefix it to a noun, 
properly so called, not a pronoun, they make it 
sing, and masc., saying 033 s' [Who, or which, 
of the two men?], and 33 3-31 O' [Who, or which, 
of the two women?], and 33 3 s' [Who, 
or which, of the men?], and O' [who, or 
which, of the women?] : and when they prefix it to 
a fem. pronoun, they make it masc. [as when 
they prefix it to a masc. pronoun] and fem., 
saying 34T' and '-33' [Who, or which, of them 
two?], meaning women; (Fr, T;) [the latter of 
which seems to be the more common; for ISd 
says,] sometimes they said us”' [Who, or which, 
of them? referring to women], meaning o3k (M.) 
It is said in the Kur [xxxi. last verse], 3*3 s 3 lij 
jiaji 33 [And a person knoweth not in what 
land he will die]: (S:) but some read 3=0 33; 
and Sb compares this fem. form to 034 (Bd.) 
When it is used as an interrogative relating to an 
indeterminate noun in a preceding phrase, is'' is 
made to conform with that indeterminate noun 
in case-ending and in gender and in number; and 
this is done [alike, accord, to some,] in the case of 
its connexion with a following word and in the 
case of a pause; so that, [in the case of a pause,] 
to him who says, 33 j 3*3 [A man came to me], 
you say, [accord, to the authorities alluded to 
above,] s' [Who?]; and to him who says, 3'j 
53. j [I saw a man], 3i [Whom?]; and to him who 
says, —03 [I passed by a man], s' 

[Whom?]: and in like manner, [accord, to all 
authorities,] in the case of its connexion with a 
following word; as 3a 3 s' [Who, O young man?], 
and 3® 3 31 [Whom, O young man?], and 3® 3 s'' 
[Whom, O young man?]: and in the case of the 
fem. you say, 3' and 3 1 and 3' [in the nom. and 
accus. and gen. respectively]; and in the dual, u3' 
and u3' in the nom. case [masc. and fem. 
respectively], and uS' and u3' in the accus. and

[BOOKI.] 


gen. cases [masc. and fem. respectively]; and in 
the pi., [with the like distinction of genders,] Oj ' 
and k— A jI in the nom. case, and 34 and 4-3 in the 
accus. and gen. cases. (I’ Ak p. 319.) [Exs. in cases 
of pause, agreeing with the foregoing rules, are 
given in the T; and exs. in cases of connexion 
with following words, agreeing with the 
foregoing, are given in the Mughnee: hut J gives 
rules differing from the foregoing in some 
respects; and IB gives rules differing in some 
points both from the foregoing and from those of 
J.] It is said in the S, 4s 1 is made to conform with 
indeterminate nouns significant of intellectual 
beings and of nonintellectual things, and is used 
as an interrogative; and when it is thus used in 
reference to an indeterminate noun, you make it 
to have a caseending like that of the noun 
respecting which it demands 

positive information; so that when it is said to 
you, 34- j (jjj- [A man passed by me], you say, 4 
4s 4 [Who, O young man?], thus giving it a case- 
ending [like that of 34 j] when it is in connexion 
with a following word; and you indicate the case- 
ending [by the pronunciation 

termed fjjll, saying s', with a somewhat obscure 
utterance of the final vowel,] in pausing; and if 
one says, 44j 4-0 [I saw a man], you say, M 
4*4 [Whom, O young man?], giving it a case- 
ending [like that of 44j], with tenween, when it 
is [thus] in connexion with a following word; and 
you pause upon the ', saying 44 and when one 
says, 34 Jj 33* [I passed by a man], you say, s' 
4*4 [Whom, O young man? in a case of 
connexion with a following word; and Is'' in a case 
of pausing]: you conform with what the other has 
said, in the nom. and accus. and gen. cases, in 
the case of connexion with a following word and 
in that of pausing: but IB says that this is correct 
only in the case of connexion with a 
following word; for in the case of a pause, you say 
only l S', in the nom. and gen., with sukoon; and 
you imitate in both of these cases only when you 
use the dual form or the pi.: it is added in the S, 
you say in the cases of the dual and pi. and fem. 
like as we have said respecting 3*: when 
one says, 34. j 43-?- [Men came to me], you 
say, ui ' [Who?], with the 3 quiescent; and 34 in 
the accus. and gen.: but IB says, the correct mode 
is to say, iji ' and 344 with fet-h to the 3 in both; 
[meaning that this is the only allowable mode in 
the case of connexion with a following word, and 
app. that it is the preferable mode in the case of 
a pause;] the quiescent 3 being allowable only in 
the case of a pause, and with respect to 34 for 
you say 34“ and 34 with the quiescent 3 only: it 
is then added in the S, you say, also, 4 [Who? 
and whom?] in using the fem. [in a case of 


pause]; but in a case of connexion with 
a following word, [when referring to a noun in 
the accus.,] you say, 4 4 45 [Whom, O thou? in 
the sing.], and 4*3 [in the pi.; and in 
like manner, -4“ in the nom. sing., and 53 in the 
gen. sing.; and ■— ‘4 1 in the nom. pi., and 445 in the 
gen. pi.]: but when the interrogation refers to a 
determinate noun, 43 is in the nom. case (with 

refa) only. (TA.) [See also u44 below.] [In 

other cases, now to be mentioned, it is used alike 
as sing., dual, and ph] — — It also denotes a 
condition; (T, S, M, Mughnee;) in which case, 
also, it is a deck noun, applied to an intellectual 
being and to a non-intellectual thing. (S.) So in 
the saying, 4i jSI ^4 jS4 pf' [Whichever of 
them treats me with honour, I will treat him with 
honour]. (S.) So, too, in the saying [in the Kur 
xvii. 110], 4411 il4YI 4a U 13 [Whichever 
ye call Him, He hath the best names]. (T, * 
Mughnee.) And in the saying [in the same, xxviii. 
28], (yt jljac 5ia 44=3 gjikSfl Uui [Whichever of 
the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no 
wrongdoing to me]. (Mughnee.) One says 
also, 44 k* 41 411 4?-=, meaning 4443 [May 
God accompany him wherever he goeth]. (AZ, T.) 
And Zuheyr uses the expression I 4l for 4l 
144 [Whatever tract they travelled, or 

travel]. (T.) The saying, jiia 3lS J 
[Whichever of me and thee be evil, may God 
abase him !] was explained by Kh to Sb 
as meaning 14 JS 111 [whichever of us two be 
evil]; and as being like the saying, 43^ s 3=4 

<4, meaning l". (M. [And in a similar 
manner, the former clause of that saying, 
occurring in a verse, with ki after is said in the 

T to have been explained by Kh to Sb.]) It is 

also a conjunct noun; (Mughnee;) [i. e.] it 
is sometimes used in the manner of ls 3', and 
therefore requires a complement; as in the 
saying, 44 jlill J [He, of them, who is 
in the house is thy brother]: (S:) [i. e.] it is syn. 
with ls 44 (M, Mughnee.) So in the saying [in the 
Kur xix. 70], 4“= 41 fs 1 5-44“ 3^ 3? 3= 3“ p 

44= [Then we will assuredly draw forth, from 
every sect, him, of them, who is most exorbitantly 
rebellious against the Compassionate]: so says 
Sb: but the Koofees and a number of the 
Basrees disagree with him, holding that the 
conjunct noun is 1 is always deck, like the 
conditional and the interrogative: Zj says, “It has 
not appeared to me that Sb has erred except in 
two instances, whereof this is one; for he has 
conceded that it is deck when separate, and how 
can he say that it is indecl. when it is a prefixed 
noun?” and El-Jarmee says, “I have gone forth 
from El-Basrah, and have not heard, from 
my leaving the Khandak to Mekkeh, any one 


say, 53' 3)4-41 [as meaning I will assuredly 
beat him, of them, who is standing], with damm:” 
these assert, that it is, in the verse above, an 
interrogative, and that it is an inchoative, and 41 
is an enunciative: but they differ as to 
the objective complement of the verb: Kh says 
that this is suppressed, and that the implied 
meaning is, we will assuredly draw forth those of 
whom it will be said, Which of them is most &c.? 
and Yoo says that it is the proposition [(44 &c.], 
and that the verb is suspended from 
governing, as in the instance in the Kur xviii. 11, 
cited above: and Ks and Akh say that it is 44 3^, 
that i> is redundant, and that the 
interrogative proposition is independent of what 
precedes it; this being grounded on their saying 
that the redundance of 3" is allowable in an 
affirmative proposition: but these [following] 
facts refute their sayings; viz. that the suspension 
of government is peculiar to verbs significant 
of operations of the mind; and that it is not 
allowable to say, J^kill 3)4-=4 with refa, as 
meaning by implication “I will assuredly beat 
him of whom it is said, He is the transgressor;” 
and that the redundance of 3* in an affirmative 
proposition is not correct. (Mughnee. [Some 
further remarks on the same subject, in that 
work, mentioning other opinions as erroneous, I 
omit. Another reading of the passage in the Kur 
cited above (xix. 70) will be found in what here 
follows.]) [ISd states that] they said, <43 3)441 
3-41 [I will assuredly beat him, of them, who is 
most excellent], and 3-41 31 [him who is most 
excel-lent]; 4 being indecl., accord, to Sb, and 
therefore the verb does not govern it [save as to 
the meaning]. (M.) And [that] you say, 4"' 4 44 
3-41 [Beat thou him, of them, who is most 
excellent], and 3-41 [meaning the same, 
or whichever of them, &c.]; suppressing the 
relative > after <454 (M in a later part of the same 
art.) Fr says that when Is'' is governed by the verb 
before it, it has not the interrogative meaning; 
and you may say, 4- 1 3j 4 3)441 [I will 

assuredly beat him, of them, or whichever 
of them, says that]: and he says that he who 
reads 444 in the accus. case, in the passage of the 
Kur cited above (xix. 70) makes it to be governed 
by (T.) Ks says, you say, j4l 4 43 1 4>4 

[I will assuredly beat him, of them, or whichever 
of them, is in the house]; but you may not 
say, J41I 4 441 44--=: thus he distinguishes 
between the actual occurrence and that which is 
expected. (S.) Akh says, also, that it may be 
indeterminate and qualified by an epithet; as 
when one says, *4 44 =44, like as one 

says, 41 =_i4-“ 34 [I passed by one pleasing to 
thee]: but this has not been heard [from the

Arabs]. (Mughnee.) — — It also denotes 
perfection, or consummateness: and in this case 
it is an epithet applying to an indeterminate 
noun; as in JAj Is i 34 j 4 j (tropical:) [Zeyd is a 
man; what a man!], meaning that he is complete, 
or consummate, in the qualities of men: and it is 
a denotative of state relating to a determinate 
noun; as in 34 j Is'' aIII 44 (tropical:) [I 
passed by 'Abd-Allah; what a man was he!]: 
(Mughnee:) and used in this sense, it is tropical. 
(Har p. 534.) [J says,] it is sometimes an epithet 
applying to an indeterminate noun: you 

say, 343 is' 343a ^33* and 343'- i A l (assumed 
tropical:) [I passed by a man; what a man!]; 
and j'jA' a 3 sijtilj (assumed tropical:) [I 

passed by a woman; what a woman!], and 
Cif'iA' USi [by two women; what two women!]; 
and j'jA' -S;' »'!>"' (assumed tropical:) [This is 
a woman; what a woman!]: and A' yj ' A' An\ 
(assumed tropical:) [What two women!]; ^ being 
redundant: and in the case of a 

determinate noun, you say, 343 '-Ai 43 
(assumed tropical:) [This is Zeyd; what a man is 
he!]; putting it in the accus. case as a denotative 
of state; and 434- '-“4 aIII aA (assumed 
tropical:) [This is the handmaid of God; what a 
girl, or young woman, is she!]: you say, also, [in 
using an indeterminate noun,] 4jiU- z'A' is' 
and 43U., and ■iCi'A si A' A\ (assumed tropical:) 
[What a woman came to thee!]; and AjJ4-A ^hA 
aaj 14 is'' (assumed tropical:) [I passed by a girl, or 
young woman; what a girl, or young woman!]; 
and VVXa A fyYJu , f!n> and 4 ^“® a) 

(assumed tropical:) [I brought thee a body- 
wrapper; what a body-wrapper!]: all are 

allowable. (S.) [In all these it evidently denotes 
admiration, or wonder, at some good or 
extraordinary quality in the person or thing 
to which it relates; notwithstanding that J says 
afterwards,] and sometimes it is used to denote 
wonder; as in the saying of Jemeel, Y ua4 
0j*-° ls\ VjiL jx. Alijl J\ V (assumed 

tropical:) [O Butheyneh, (0 a 4 being a curtailed 
form of a±4a, a woman's name,) adhere thou 
to “No:” verily “No,” if thou adhere to it, 
notwithstanding the numbers of the slanderers, 
what a help will it he!]: (S:) i. e., an excellent 
help will be thy saying “No” in repelling, or 
rebutting, the slanderers, though they he many. 
(TA in art. uj°.) Fr gives as exs. of its use 
to denote wonder the sayings, 43 J?. j is'' [What a 
man is Zeyd!], and mau aaJ-4 is' [What a girl, or 
young woman, is Zeyneb!]. (T.) It 
denotes wonder at the sufficiency, and great 
degree of competence, of the person [or thing] to 
whom [or to which] it relates. (M.) El-Kattal El- 


Kilabee says, acU* s' aIIe- Ciiii AlS Sk ^jii Ciji j Ulj 
e-iiA [And when I saw that I had slain him, I 
repented of it; in what an hour, or time, 
of repentance!]: i. e., when I slew him, I repented 
of it, in a time when repentance did not profit: is'' 
being here in the accus. case as an adv. n.; for, as 
it denotes the part of a whole, its predicament is 
made to be the same as that of the affixed noun, 

of whatever kind this may be. (Ham p. 95.) 

It also has 4 prefixed to it; and thus it 
becomes changed in signification so as to denote 
numerousness, being syn. with the enunciative A 
[How many!]; (S, K;) or syn. with 4“ j [as 
meaning many]: (Sb, M:) [and sometimes it is 
syn. with the interrogative A> meaning how 
many? or how much? as will be shown below:] 
thus it is written is 4, (M,) or ua 4, (S, M, K,) its 
tenween being written u; (S, K;) and ;l£, (M,) or 
[more commonly] C>A, (S, M, K, [in some copies 
of the S and K u44]) like (S,) said by IJ, on 
the authority of Aboo-'Alee, to be formed 
from by putting the double s before the «, 
after the manner of the transposition in and a 
number of other words, so that it becomes A 
[or AA], then suppressing the second s, as is 
done in 44 and 3 a* and 34, so that it 
becomes *iA [or 0 ?l 4“], and then changing the 
[remaining] s into I, as in [(44>, which 
becomes] is and in [is jaa, which 

becomes] is J -*■, so that it becomes A [or u)^]; 
(M;) and it has other dial, vars.; namely AA [one 
of the intermediate forms between uaiS and A^ 
mentioned above]; (K; [in one copy of the K 
written AA, and so accord, to the TK;]) and sA, 
(M, K,) of the measure of As, and most probably 
formed by transposition from f A, mentioned 
above; (M;) and 4 of the measure of f-, (M, 
TA,) incorrectly written in the copies of the K AS, 
i. e. like (TA,) formed by the suppression of s 

in fdsS; a change not greater than that from Ai' 
Aill to aIII j. and aIII (M.) You say, diml 5U. j jjiS 
[How many a man have I met! or many a man 
&c.], (S, K, *) putting the noun following AA in 
the accus. case as a specificative; (S;) and ujiS 
Crnl 34 J Of; (S, K; *) and the introduction of a* 
after AA is more common, and better. (S. [And 
Sb, as cited in the M, says the like.]) You say 
also, 44j [How many a man has come 

to me! or many a man &c.]. (Sb, M.) And jfy AA 
M#' i. e. jap [For how much wilt thou sell 
this garment, or piece of cloth?]. (S.) Kh says 
that if any one of the Arabs made it to govern the 
gen. case, perhaps he did so by making a? to be 
implied, as is allowable with A'- (M:) [so that you 
may say, '** Aiyjlil A jj CsAj For how many a 
dirhem didst thou buy this? for] it is allowable to 


make the noun that follows A to be governed in 
the gen. case by i> implied, when A immediately 
follows a preposition; as in I** ciyjlil A jj 
but when it is not thus preceded by a preposition, 
the noun after it must be in the accus. case. (I 'Ak 
p. 317.) It always holds the first place in a 

proposition, like A. (Idem, next p.) It is also 

a connective of the vocative 4 with the noun 
signifying the person or persons or thing called, 
when this noun has the article J prefixed to it; 
(S, M, Mughnee, K;) and with a noun of 
indication, as fy and with a conjunct noun 
having Jl prefixed to it, as (1 'Ak p. 268:) it is 
a noun formed for serving as such a connective; 
(M, K;) and has 1* affixed to it. (S, M, &c.) 
You say, 344 1 43 4 [which seems to be best 
rendered O thou man; more agreeably with the 
original, O thou, the man; or, accord, to Akh, O 
thou who art the man; lit., O he who is the man; 
often written 4*4]; (T, S, M, Mughnee, K;) 
and lP'-pjII 4a34 [O ye two men]; and 4*34 
[O ye men]; (M;) and A [o thou woman]; 

(S, M;) and A'A^' 1^1 t, [q y e two women]; 
and SjjAill 4-41 [O ye women]; and Afydl 4 a'4, 
and A'A^', and S3LAII; (M;) and 'a 4^4 [o thou, 
this person or thing]; and 'A 3* a I U [o 

thou who didst, or hast done, thus]. (I ’Ak p. 
267.) In the first of the exs. here given, is 1 is a 
noun of vague signification, (Zj, T, S,) denoting 
the person called, (Zj, T,) of the sing, number, 
(Zj, T, S,) rendered determinate by the vocative 
[1a], (S,) indecl., with damm for its termination; 
(Zj, T, S;) and 1* is a particle employed to rouse 
attention, or to give notice, a substitute for the 
noun to which is'' is in other cases prefixed; 
and 343 1 is a qualificative to is', (Zj, T, S,) 
wherefore it is in the nom. case. (S.) Akh asserts, 
[as we have indicated above,] that is' is here the 
conjunct noun, and that the first member of its 
complement, namely the relative >, is 
suppressed; the meaning being, 343 1 > iA 1): 
but this assertion is refuted by the fact that there 
is no relative pronoun that must be suppressed, 
nor any conjunct noun that necessarily 
requires that its complement should be a 
nominal proposition: though he might reply to 
these two objections by arguing that A in the 
saying Aj Y is in like manner [virtually] in 
the nom. case [as a conjunct noun syn. with 
and that the first member of its complement, 
namely >, an inchoative of which Aj is the 
enunciative, is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The 
putting of the qualificative of is' in the accus. 
case, as in the saying 3^1 i U [O thou man, 

advance], is allowed (M, K) by El-Mazinee; but it 
is not known [as heard from the Arabs]. (M.) W i

the quiescent j is changed into I; and he relates of 
Kh, that he allowed the rel. n. of *4 to be [ (bi and 
l y and lSj'; but as to lS/4, he says, I know not 
any one who has said it except J: (TA:) or it is of 
the measure (s, Msb, K,) originally *44, 

contracted by the suppression of its final radical 
letter [with the preceding kesreh]: so accord, to 
Fr: [but see what follows (after the pis.), where 
this is said to be the opinion of Ks, and 
disallowed by Fr:] (S, Msb:) the pi. is xUi and 
i (ji, (S, M, Msb, K,) [or the latter is rather a coll, 
gen. n.,] and pi. pi. 44: (M, K:) J says that one of 
its pis. is (sGl [and we find the same also in some 
copies of the K;] but this is a mistake 
for 44, which is pi. of Is l not of *4: (IB, TA:) and 
this pi., being of the measure (Ji*ii, has been 
adduced as evidence that the medial radical letter 
is is, not j: (TA:) the dim. is [ *44, [of the 
measure changed to blUi because of the 


medial radical lS,] which, accord, to Fr, shows the 
opinion of Ks, that *4 is of the measure bleG 
rendered defective by the suppression of its final 
radical letter, to be incorrect, because [Fr holds, 
in opposition to some others, that] a noun of this 
measure has not its dim. formed on the 
measure unless it is a proper name. (T.) They 
said, 'ib ilj <l*il [Do thou it at the sign of such a

And [in this sense, as is indicated by the context 
in the M,] it is one of the nouns that are prefixed 
to verbs [as virtually governing the gen. 
case], (M, K, *) because of the nearness of its 
meaning to the meaning of time: (K:) as in the 
saying [of a poet], JGUI *4j [At the 

sign of your urging forward the horses, 
unsmoothed in their coats, or not curried; which 
means nearly the same as “at the time of your 
urging” &c.]. (M.) — — A sign as meaning an 

indication, an evidence, or a proof. (TA.) A 

sign as meaning a miracle; [and a wonder; 

for] “dll cjUI means the wonders of God. (TA.) 

An example, or a warning; (Fr, T, M, Msb, K;) as, 
for instance, the case of Joseph and his brethren, 
related in the Kur: (Fr, T:) pi. J, (si (M, K)

communication sent from one person or party to

corporeal form or figure or substance, (S, M, K,) 
of a man, (S,) which one sees from a distance; [as

anything. (AA, S, M.) — — [Hence, accord,

&c.]: (S:) or J is in error in saying this: it is used 
in calling to him who is distant: (Mughnee, K:) so 
say Ibn-El-Hajib, in the Kafiyeh, and ElFakhr El- 
Jarabardee; and the latter adds, or to him who is 
in a predicament like that of him who is distant, 
being sleeping or inadvertent; the person who 
calls thereby being eager for the person called to 
advance to him: (TA:) or not used in calling to 
him who is near: (K:) and » is substituted for its 
hemzeh; (M, K;) so that one says, L*. (M.) AZ 
says, I have heard them say, J4 »4 4. (T in 4b 
cjlilVI.) [Accord, to the TA, (art. I,) one says 
also 4.] p4ill 3„ and and 41, and 4', 
and se e art. l s'. 4 (S, M, K, &c.) and 4, (M, K,) 

the latter form used by some, as related on the 
authority of Ktr; (M;) accord, to some, (M,) a 
noun of vague signification, (S, M, K,) 
used metonymically for a noun in the accus. case, 
(M,) with which are connected all the affixed 
pronouns that denote the accus. case: you say 14! 
[Thee] and 4j [him] and (4,1 [me] (S, K) and 4)1 
[us, &c.]: (SO and the hemzeh is changed into j, 
so that you say 4t)j (S, M, K *) and 4 jj; (Ktr, IJ, 
M, K; *) and sometimes into j, so that you 
say 4l)j [and app. 4l)j also; both of which are 
used by some of the Arabs in the present day, 
very commonly in Egypt, for 4)13 as 
meaning 44; like as one says 4 jj, meaning 4 
f)j]: (K:) the 4 and » and lS [&c.] are put to show 
the object meant, in order that the person 
addressed may be known from the absent [&c.]; 
and have no place in the analysis of a 
sentence, like the 4 in 4jj and 4)1 jl ; (S, M: in the 
former of which is added, and like the I and u 
in cail : ) and this is identical with the opinion 
of Akh: (M, TA:) thus 9 is the noun, and what 
follows it is to denote allocution, [&c.,] and the 
two become as one thing; for nouns of 
vague signification are not prefixed to other 
nouns to govern them in the gen. case, nor are 
any of the pronouns, being themselves 
determinate. (S.) Ibn-Keysan says, (S, M,) some 
of the grammarians say that 4U ; altogether, is a 
noun; and he adds, but some say (M) that the 4 
and » &c. are the nouns, and that 9 is a support 
thereto, because they cannot stand by 
themselves, (S, M,) like the 4 &c. which occupy 
the latter place in 4>4 &c.; so when the 4 &c. 
are put first, [as in 4U Thee I beat, or 

struck,] they are supported by 4, and the 
whole becomes as one thing: (S:) and you may 
also say, L 4! 4)^4= [I beat, or struck, me]; 
because it is not allowable to say, 3^3*='- (S as 
corrected by IB:) but you may not say, 4t)J 
[I beat, or struck, thee]; because you only 
require 44 when you cannot use the 4 [alone]; 


though you may say, 44 >4)14= [I beat, or struck, 
thee, thee]; because the 4 is made to be 
syntactically dependent upon the verb, so when 
you repeat it you require 9. (S.) In the saying of 
the poet, (S,) Dhu-l-Isba' El-'Adwanee, 
(TA,) 4)1 l4l ja fjjUS, [As though we, on the 
day of Kurra, only killed ourselves], he has 
separated it from the verb only because the Arabs 
do not make the action of the agent to fall upon 
the agent itself by the adjunction of the pronoun: 
they do not say, but only ,^*4 43 : so the 
poet has used 4)1 in the same manner as 44. (s, 
TA.) Some of the grammarians say that 4 is 
prefixed to what follows it, governing it in the 
gen. case; and adduce as an evidence thereof a 
saying which see below, commencing with 4 
(4. (S.) Zj says that it is an explicit noun, 
[not a pronoun,] which is prefixed to all the 
pronouns, governing them in the gen. case; 
but only to pronouns; so that if one said, 4j 4 
4134.. it would be bad. (M.) Kh holds that it is a 
pronoun prefixed to the 4 [&c.], governing it in 
the gen. case; (M, K;) and the like is related to 
have been the opinion of El-Mazinee: and Sb 
relates of Kh that he said, if any one were to 
say 44j 4t)l [Thee, thyself], I would not severely 
blame him, for this 4 is [virtually] governed in 
the gen. case. (M.) But accord, to Akh, it is a 
simple, or uncompounded, pronoun, the ending 
of which becomes altered, as the endings of 
pronouns are wont to become, because of the 
varying of the numbers of the persons using 
them; (M, K; [in both of which the last of the 
word thus rendered is accord, to a copy 

of the M, i. e. 0jj= 4 = ' l; in a copy of the 

K, without any syll. signs; and in the 
CK, I; of which readings, I have 

followed that found in the M; supposing the 
meaning to be, that 9 has different endings 
according as it is used by one speaking to 
another, or by one speaking of another, or by one 
speaking of himself, or to, or of, two or more, and 
the like;]) and the 4 of 4)1 is like the 4 of 4]j. 
inasmuch as it is an indication of allocution only, 
divested of the idea of its being a sign of the 
pronoun. (M.) Of all these varying opinions, IJ 
says that he has found none to be correct when 
investigated, except that of Akh; with whose 
opinion, that stated in the begining of this art. 
is identical [except as to the affix, which is there 
said to be a pronoun, not merely a particle of 
allocution]. (M, TA.) Zj, being asked to explain 
the meaning of the phrase 4= 4),!, [in the Kur i. 
4,] answered, 4= 4i3k. [Thine essence we 
worship]; and said that it is derived from -4. 
meaning “a sign by which a thing is known:” but 


IJ does not approve of this. (M.) [Respecting the 
phrase, 4t)l ji lii, i n which 44 is used in the 
place of a noun in the nom. case, and which is 

therefore disallowed by Sb, see 4.] It is also 

used for the purpose of cautioning, or putting one 
on his guard. (T, S.) You say, 41)1 [Beware 
thou of, or avoid thou, or remove thyself far 
from, the lion]: it is a substitute for a verb; as 
thou you said, 4l) : and you say also, 4U»; like as 
you say 13 J and 3 j 4 (S:) [or 44 in this case is 
governed by a verb understood: for] Ibn-Keysan 
says, when you say, 4 jj 41)1 [Beware thou of, or 
avoid thou, or remove thyself far from, Zeyd], 
you caution him whom you address against Zeyd, 
and the verb governing the accus. case is not 
apparent: the meaning is, 4j 4 j4i [I caution 
thee against Zeyd]; as though you said, 44 4 
4jj [I caution thee, thee with Zeyd]; or as 
though you said, 44 I4j jcUj 4j jc. 4I4j jcl) 
[Remove thyself far from Zeyd, and remove Zeyd 
far from thee]; so that the verb governs the word 
signifying the person cautioned and that 
signifying him against whom that person is 
cautioned: (TA:) [and Az says,] when you say, 4)1 
34441 the verb is suppressed: it is as 

though you said, 34441 >_ij£j 4 j4l [i caution 
thee against the committing of that which 
exceeds the bounds of rectitude]. (T.) Kh 
is related to have heard an Arab of the desert say, 
(T, * M, the latter on the authority of Sb.,) ^4)1 
4ljill 4 j ;t)la uj= 4 [When the man attains 
to sixty years, I caution him against, or let him 
avoid, the young women]; (T, S, M;) prefixing 4 
to 41 ydl, and putting the latter in the gen. case: 
(S:) but accord, to Akh, it is not allowable to 
say [thus, or] 4j 4 j 4)1. (m.) Sometimes the j is 
suppressed, as in the saying of the poet, 4)1 4l)la 
414. jlilij ULi jiJI Jj 3)ti iij4l [Then avoid thou, 
avoid thou obstinate disputation, for it is wont

say [properly], j\j 44 [Beware thou of, or

like: (TA, from a marginal note in a copy of the

IAar cites the following ex., from a poet: 503 4J 
jjyiAll uJill [We were, or have become, 
fatigued, by the Lord of the lean and lank-bellied 
youthful she-camels]: but Lth says that there is 
no verb derived from 4 k in this sense, except 
in poetry: (T:) Aboo-Mohammad says that the 
only instance is that cited above: (TA:) [it is not 
disputed that] 4 ' signifies fatigue, or the being 
fatigued or tired: (S, K:) AZ says that it has no 
verb formed from it; but on this point he has 
been contradicted: (S:) A ’Obeyd also says that it 
has no verb. (M.) — uk aor. 45, inf. n. 4k (S, M,

this; its meaning being only «45j and 4*5 or, 
accord, to AZ, 4 has an inf. n., namely 4k and if 
the case be so, the two [verbs] are equal; neither 
being the original of the other: (IJ in the 
Khasais:) Suh, in the R, asserts that 4 is formed 
by transposition from 4k (TA:) the assertion of 
El-Bekree, that 4 is originally with j [for its 
medial radical letter], and that it is of the class 
of 43, aor. 4 ), requires consideration, and 
involves what is contrary to rule. (MF.) You say

[BOOKI.] 


fitting to be used as such, may not be used 
otherwise; occurring in a determinate sense; (S, 
K;) the Jl being inseparable from it; (IJ, M, Msb;) 
not prefixed to it for the purpose of rendering it 
determinate, because it has not that which 
participates in its meaning: (S, Msb, K:) as Ibn- 
Es-Sarraj says, there is not one ui and another a': 
(Msb:) [accord, to ISd, who quotes a long 
disquisition by IJ on this word,] the J which is 
expressed in this case is redundant, because the 
noun is determinate without it, but it is rendered 
so by another Jl, which is understood, as in the 
case of so says IJ, following Aboo-'Alee; and 
his is the correct opinion: (M:) Fr says that it is a 
particle, compounded with Jt, which is 
inseparable from it; and that it is originally 3'4 
[or u 1 jXI]: or that it may have originated from the 
phrase u 1 XII 3 [explained above], and is 
therefore mansoob, like and tJS when used as 
nouns: but Zj disallows its originating from jl; 
and says that the right opinion is that of Kh, 
that lX' is indecl. with fet-h for its termination, 
and that the Jl is prefixed because the meaning 
is distil and this is the opinion of Sb. (T.) You 
say, ^ dJial jVI LI [I, at the present time, or now, 
do, or will do, thus, or such a thing]. (M.) 
And jXl ciuS ; meaning I was, in this time, of 
which part is present and some portions 
have passed, with him, or in his presence. (IJ, 
M.) And when you mean the kind of expression 
which is used in this saying, you say, lX 1 
jjjli jll jA [The term “ now ” is the limit of the two 
times; namely the past and the future]; thus 
pronounced, marfooa: so says IJ: but in the Book 
of Sb we read, gLU jll X* lXI, with nasb: and in 
like manner, in the same, LLi LXI [Now is thy 
time]; the former with nasb and the latter with 
refa. (M.) You say also, LXI ljIjI ^ [This is the 
present time]: and LXI LjIjI X! ,Jl , meaning I 
came not save at the present time, or now: with 
the last word mansoob in both instances. (ISh, 
T.) [And LXI J! and LXl To the present time 
and until the present time; i. e. hitherto. And o* 
LXI From the present time; henceforward.] 
Sometimes the hemzeh [after the J] is 
suppressed, and its vowel is transferred to the J; 
so that you say LX'. (Bd ii. 66 .) And sometimes 
also the J is pronounced with fet-h and both the 
hemzehs are suppressed; so that you say LX. (S, 
K.) And sometimes Xj is prefixed to it, like as it is 
to uss so that you say d£®, like as you say 
(El-Umawee, A 'Obeyd. [See art. oX]) jjl Fatigue. 
(S, K, &c.) [Whether it be a simple subst., or an 
inf. n., and, if the latter, whether it be an inf. n.

a season; syn. ue-; (S, M, K;) as also J, u4 (M, K) 
and J. X. (S, K.) [See l, last sentence.] L4 is an 
adverbial noun, (Msb,) an interrogative 
respecting a place: (S, M, Msb, K:) [signifying 
Where? in what place?]: Zj says that it is an 
interrogative particle, like ‘-XS: (T:) [ISd says,] it 
is a noun, because you say, L4 Of [meaning From 
what place? whence?]: (M:) [and you say also, JJ 
54 To what place? whither?]: it is 

always mansoob, unless you prefix the article to 
it, saying 0 -X 1 [which means The place where]: 
(Lth, T:) it is fem.; but may be made masc. (Lh, 
M.) You say, 4j 54 Where, or in what place, is 
Zeyd? (S, Msb.) And Llix jji [where is thy house, 
or tent?]. (M.) And XL majj 54, which may mean 
Where, or whither, wilt thou be taken away, and 
what will be done with thee and made to come to 
pass with thee, if this be thine intellect? or, 
accord, to Mtr, it is a saying of the people of 
Baghdad, addressed to him whom they charge 
with foolish judgment or opinion, as meaning 54 
XAjj [where, or whither, is thine intellect 
taken away?]. (Har p. 574 .) [And Lili 1 > IL» 54 
and LSI j Lp and 2li j What place does this hold in 
relation to that, or in comparison with that? what 
is this in relation to that, or in comparison with 
that? what has this to do with that? what has this 

in common with that?] It also denotes a 

condition: when you say, LX4-I LX4x 54 [Where 
thou sittest, I will sit], the sitting must be in one 
place: and L> is added to it; so that you say, 4X' 
fsl [Wherever thou standest, I will stand]. (Msb.) 
— — It also occurs used as a proper name of 
a particular place: thus the poet Homeyd Ibn- 
Thowr speaks of his companions as being j La4 
XL4 [app. meaning In certain places: where and 
wherever those places were, there were my 
companions]: in which case it is divested of the 
meaning of an interrogative, and is 
imperfectly deck because determinate and of the 
fem. gender. (M, L. [In one copy of the 
former, LLjl 3 <^4, which may mean the same; 
and voce l S', q. v., LLjl j 5L.]) ui[: see u4. 34, (T,

measure (Msb,) also pronounced J, '34„ (T, 
S, M, K,) the latter of the dial, of Suleym, 
mentioned by Fr, (T, S,) and by Zj, (M,) is an 
interrogative respecting a time, (T, S, Msb,) but 
only respecting a time not come: (T:) signifying 
When? (S, M, Msb;) at what time? (Msb, K:) it is 
fem.; but may be made masc.: (Lh, M:) and it 
may be pronounced with imaleh, though not 
belonging to a class of words regularly subject to 
imaleh. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [xvi. 22 
and xxvii. 67 ], accord, to different readings, 50 
0 or l 34 [When they shall be raised to life]; 
(T, S, M;) i. e. when shall be the resurrection.

IJ says that, were it syn. with it would be 
conditional; whereas it was not mentioned by 
his colleagues among the adverbs used 
conditionally, as ^ and La' &c.: but sometimes it 
has a conditional meaning, though that meaning 
be not explicit. (M.) A poet says, XlLyi 34 
Jjj X L* 4 PXI X jis 4 j 4 Jit [when we 
grant thee security, thou wilt be secure

[We stopped, and we said, Tell us 
some tidings: inform us (4>j^i being app. 
understood) respecting Umm-Salim: but what is 
the case (meaning what is the use) of speaking to 
the vacant dwellings?], he has used the word 
without tenween, though making no interruption 
after it, because he intended a pause. (ISk, S.) 
Ibn-Es-Seree says, When you say, Jlj *9), you 
only command him to tell you more of the subject 
of discourse known to you and him, as though 
you said, cjU [Give, or relate, the story, or 

narrative, O man]: but if you say, <i\, with 
tenween, it is as though you said, ciiU 

^ [Give, or relate, some story or narrative], 


because the tenween renders indeterminate: and 
Dhu-rRummeh meant the tenween, but omitted 
it through necessity. (S.) As says that Dhu- 
rRummeh has committed a mistake; 
the expression of the Arabs being only <i\ [in a 
case of this kind]: ISd says, the truth is, that it is 
without tenween when determinate, and with 
tenween when indeterminate; and that Dhu-r- 
Rummeh asks the ruins to tell him more of a 
known story, as though he said, Relate to us 
the story, or tell us the tidings: (TA:) Aboo-Bekr 
Ibn-Es-Sarraj says, citing this verse, that -^1 is not 
known in a case of this kind without tenween in 
any of the dialects; meaning that it is never 
conjoined with a following word unless it be with 
tenween. (IB, TA.) fei: see what next

[and and ^ [and ^ and I j] and [and ^ 
and and 1*] and 4; because in this case they are 
not generally regarded as nouns, but as mere 
sounds: (Sb, M:) [these are generally pronounced 
with imaleh, i. e. be, te, &c., with the exception 
of Ifa ,1^, and 11=; and when they are regarded 
as nouns, their duals are 04), cM &c.:] the pi. 
of is and that of 4 is sijii (TA ubi supra.) 
It is one of the letters termed [or vocal, i. 

e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the 
breath only]; and of those termed [or 

labial]; and of those termed ijlj [or pronounced 
with the extremity of the tongue or the lips]: Kh 
says that the letters of the second and third 
classes above mentioned [the latter of which 
comprises the former] are those composing the 
words ^ ip yj; and on account of their easiness 
of utterance, they abound in the composition of 
words, so that no perfect quinqueliteral-radical 
word is without one or more of them, unless it 
is of the class termed not of the classical 
language of the Arabs. (TA at the commencement 
of AJI mW.) — — In the dial, of Mazin, it is 
changed into j>; (TA ubi supra;) as in which 
thus becomes [the town of Mekkeh]. (TA 
in <illl i_iWI i_Aj.) — is a preposition, or particle 
governing the gen. case; (S, Mughnee, K;) having 
kesr for its invariable termination because it is 
impossible to begin with a letter after which one 
makes a pause; (S;) or, correctly speaking, having 
a vowel for its invariable termination because it is 
impossible to begin with a quiescent letter; and 
having kesr, not fet-h, to make it accord with its 
government [of the gen. case], and to 
distinguish between it and that which is both a 
noun and a particle. (IB.) It is used to denote 
adhesion (Sb, T, S, M, Mughnee, K) of the verb to 
its objective complement, (S,) or of a noun or 
verb to that to which it is itself prefixed; (TA;) 
and adjunction, or association: (Sb, T:) and 
some say that its meaning of denoting adhesion 
is inseparable from it; and therefore Sb restricted 
himself to the mention of this 


meaning: (Mughnee:) or Sb says that its primary 
meaning is that of denoting adhesion and 
mixture. (Ibn-Es-Saigh, quoted in a marginal 
note in a copy of the Mughnee.) It denotes 
adhesion [&c.] in the proper sense; (Mughnee, 
K;) as in (M, Mughnee, K,) meaning I 

laid hold upon, or seized, [Zeyd, or] somewhat of 
the body of Zeyd, or what might detain him, as an 
arm or a hand, or a garment, and the like; 
whereas may mean I withheld him, or 

restrained him, from acting according to his own 
free will: (Mughnee:) and it denotes the same in a 
tropical sense; (Mughnee, K;) as in [i 

passed by Zeyd]; (S, Mughnee, K;) as though 
meaning I made my passing to adhere to Zeyd; 
(S;) or I made my passing to adhere to a place 
near to Zeyd: accord, to Akh, it is for ^ Ci jji 
fj j; but cj j y> is more common than 

and is therefore more properly regarded as the 
original form of expression: (Mughnee:) accord, 
to F, the vowel of this preposition is kesr [when 
it is prefixed to a noun or a pronoun]; or, as some 
say, it is fet-h when it is with a noun properly so 
called; as in j*: so in the K; this being the 
reverse of what they have prescribed in the case 
of [the preposition] J: but in the case of m, no 
vowel but kesr is known. (MF.) It denotes the 
same in the saying [In him is a disease; i. e. 
a disease is cleaving to him]: and so [accord, to 
some] in <U4 [i swore, or, emphatically, I 

swear, by God; and similar phrases, respecting 
which see a later division of this paragraph]. (L.) 
So, too, in 4B-! because meaning He 

associated another with God: and in iP^j 
meaning I associated a [or factor &c.] with 
such a one. (T.) [And so in other phrases here 
following.] -4^ Keep thou to Zeyd: or take 
thou Zeyd. (TA voce -4^ (.^ Keep thou to 
such a thing: (El-Munawee:) or take thou such a 
thing. (Ham p. 216.) cioij} l^ja Keep thou to it, 
meaning 41*2, (Mgh in art. 4*) [or let 
him keep to it, i. e. 4 <jl*2j or thou hast taken to, 
or adopted and followed, or adhered to, the 
established way, or the way established by the

this practice, or action, is excellence attained, or 
he will attain excellence, i. e. <1*411 jl <11411 

Jill, or Jli; (IAth uhi supra;) and 

excellent is the practise, the established way, or 
the way established by the Prophet, j 
meaning 4111 3J14JI (Mgh,) or and 

excellent is the practice, or the action, i. e. 

< ' 1 -4 JI, (S and K in art. 4 , ) or jl 3 1 ‘ VA' I 
<1*411; (IAth ubi supra:) and it also occurs in a 
trad., where the meaning is [He who hath done 
such a thing hath adhered to the ordinance of 
indulgence; and excellent is the practice, or 
action, &c.: for here W 1 is meant to 

imply] (TA in the present art. See 

also art. f*<) It is also used to render a verb 

transitive; (Mughnee, K;) having the same effect 
as hemzeh [prefixed], in causing [what would 
otherwise be] the agent to become an objective 
complement; as in ctuai S yn. with [1 
made Zeyd to go away; or I took him away]; 
(Mughnee;) and hence, [in the Kur ii. 16,] <111 j 
[God taketh away their light]; (Mughnee, 
K;) which refutes the assertion of Mbr and Suh, 
that jf ciua j means [I went away with Zeyd; i. e.] 
I accompanied Zeyd in going away. (Mughnee.) J 
says that any verb that is not trans. you may 
render so by means of y and I [prefixed] 
and reduplication [of the medial radical letter]: 
you say, <j jM* and and [as meaning He 
made him to fly, or to fly away]: but IB says that 
this is not correct as of common application; for 
some verbs are rendered trans. by means of 
hemzeh, but not by reduplication; and some by 
reduplication, but not by hemzeh; and some 
by m, but not by hemzeh nor by reduplication: 
you say, jp*-i ^*a4 [as meaning I made ’ 
Amr to repel Zeyd, lit. I repelled Zeyd by ’ Amr], 

but not nor (TA.) It also denotes 

the employing a thing as an aid or instrument; (S, 
M, * Mughnee, K; *) as in cimS [1 wrote with 
the reed-pen]; (S, Mughnee, K;) and gjil W 
[I worked as a carpenter with the adz]; 
(Mughnee, K;) and [1 struck with the 

sword]. (M.) And hence the Sr 1 in <!H jJjj, 
(Mughnee, K,) accord, to some, because the 
action [before which it is pronounced] is not

practicable in the most perfect manner but by 
means of it: (Mughnee:) but others disallow this, 
because the name of God should not be regarded 
as an instrument: (MF, TA:) and some say that 
the m here is to denote beginning, as though one 
said, 411 A Al [I begin with the name of God]. 

(TA.) It also denotes a cause; as in fAlL 44 

JAxll 4^-44 [Verily ye have wronged 

yourselves by, i. e. because of, your taking 
to yourselves the calf as a god (Kur ii. 51)]; and 
in 4.1=3 [And every one of these we have 
punished for, i. e. because of, his sin (Kur xxix. 
39)]; (Mughnee, K) and in AA All 4*4 ji 
[Not any of you shall enter Paradise by, or for, or 
because of, his works]. (TA from a trad.) And so 
in *LYI ijj cjjal 1 met, or found, by reason of 
my meeting, or finding, Zeyd, the lion: 
(Mughnee:) or the m in this instance denotes 
comparison; [i. e. I met, or found, in Zeyd the like 
of the lion;] as also in >411 uA A 3 [I saw in 
such a one the like of the moon]. (TA.) Another 
ex. of the same usage is the saying [of a poet], 4 
J jYI AS 4 jtilly jlilly Cy [Their camels 

had been watered because of the brand that they 
bore: for fire, or the brand, sometimes cures of 
the heat of thirst]; i. e., because of their being 
branded with the names [or marks] of their 
owners, they had free access left them to the 
water. (Mughnee. See also another reading of this 
verse voce 3A) [In like manner] it is used in the 
sense of 44 u* [which means mA (Msb in 
art. J4)] in the saying of Lebeed, J 3*4 mIc. 

Ujljj 3s*4 A (S) Thick-necked men, 
like lions, who threatened one another because of 
rancorous feelings, as though they were the Jinn 
of the valley El-Bedee, [or of the desert, (TA in 
art. j*j,)] their feet standing firm in contention 
and obstinate altercation. (EM pp. 174 and 175.) 
It is also used to denote a cause when prefixed 
to A and to 4 as in A 1 h44 uj> 4; 1 A 4*4 A* 
[That was because they used to disbelieve in the 
signs of God]; and in IjA. A 4111 [That was 
because they disobeyed]: both instances in the 

Kur ii. 58. (Bd.) It is also used to denote 

concomitance, as syn. with £*; (Mughnee, K;) as 
in *-?•>* j A-A 3* j*N A3*“! [I bought the horse 
with his bit and bridle and his saddle]; (TA;) and 
in m 3* A3 A i. e. When he saw me 

advancing with the weapon, [he fled;] or when he 
saw me possessor of a weapon; (Sh, T;) and 
in AA A*! [Descend thou with security, or with 
greeting (Kur xi. 50)]; and in J&I4 I jlll iSj [They 
having entered with unbelief (Kur v. 66)]; 
(Mughnee, K;) j*S 1U being a denotative of state. 
(Bd.) Authors differ respecting the m in 


I _! 

the saying, 4L.3 *A j4^a, in the Kur [xv. 98 and 
ex. 3]; some saying that it denotes concomitance, 
and that *«=> is prefixed to the 
objective complement, so that the meaning 
is, y liJ-k ■W*' [Declare thou his (thy Lord's) 
freedom from everything derogatory from his 
glory, praising Him], i. e. declare thou his 
freedom from that which is not suitable to Him, 
and ascribe to Him that which is suitable to Him; 
but others say that it denotes the employing a 
thing as an aid or instrument, and that m is 
prefixed to the agent, so that the meaning is, 4=4“ 
4-L <1 AA by [declare thou his (thy Lord's) 
freedom from everything derogatory from his 
glory by means of ascribing to Him that 
wherewith He hath praised himself]: and so, too, 
respecting the saying, AiiAj 4-4 AlAAr some 
asserting that it is one proposition, the, being 
redundant; but others saying, it is two 
propositions, the j being a conjunction, and the 
verb upon which the m is dependent being 
suppressed, so that the meaning is, [I declare thy 
freedom from everything derogatory from 
thy glory, o God,] bli=4“ 41i*=^j [and with the 
praising of Thee, or by means of the praise that 
belongeth to Thee, I declare thy freedom 
&c.]. (Mughnee. [Other explanations of these two 
phrases have been proposed; but those given 
above are the most approved.]) You also say, A- 
% meaning Bring thou him, [i. e.] come with 
him, to me. (Har p. 109 .) A i_a 3YI 4^° cbslba 
AA-3, in the Kur ix. 119, means 44- j* [i. e. The 
earth became strait to them, with, meaning 
notwithstanding, its amplitude, or spaciousness]. 
(Bd.) Sometimes the negative Y intervenes 
between m [denoting concomitance] and the 
noun governed by it in the gen. case; [so that A 
signifies Without;] as in *0 % AiA. [1 came 
without travelling-provision]. (Mughnee and K in 

art. Y.) It is also syn. with A before a noun 

signifying a place or a time; (Mughnee, * K, * 
TA;) as in *>4 * 1 4 [I sat in the mosque]; 

(TA;) and j*4 kill 4 j~a iai} [And verily God aided 
you against your enemies at Bedr (Kur iii. 119)]; 
and AA f*'4A [We saved them a little before 
daybreak (Kur liv. 34)]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) and 
so in 0 jA 4 A4 (T, K,) in the Kur [lxviii. 6], (TA,) 
accord, to some, (T, Mughnee,) i. e. In which 
of you is madness; or in which of the two parties 
of you is the mad: (Bd:) or the m is here 
redundant; (Sb, Bd, Mughnee;) the meaning 
being which of you is he who is afflicted with 
madness. (Bd. [See also a later division of this 
paragraph.]) — — It also denotes 

substitution; [meaning Instead of, or in place of;] 


as in the saying [of the Hamasee (Mughnee)], Ala 
bus j j Ll_b3a SjliYI Ijib I jA j 111 L>j$a . L.; ^1 
[Then would that I had, instead of them, a people 
who, when they mounted their beasts, poured the 
sudden attack, they being horsemen and camel- 
riders]; (Ham p. 8, Mughnee, K;) i. e., A* Yi 
(TA:) but some read 1 j*4 [and so it is in 

some, app., the most correct, of the copies of 
the Mughnee,] for A 1 j*A [hastened for the 
making a sudden attack]. (Ham, Mughnee.) So, 
too, in the saying, kb l>A mA 'A AAiel 
[I received, in the place of this garment, or piece 
of cloth, one better than it]; and 1 34 44 ‘AA [I 
found, in the place of Zeyd, a man of abundant 
generosity or beneficence]; and 414 A [This is 
instead, or in the place, of that; but see another 
explanation of this last phrase in what follows]. 
(The Lubab, TA.)— — It also denotes requital; 
or the giving, or doing, in return; (Mughnee, K;) 
and in this case is prefixed to the word signifying 
the substitute, or thing given or done in exchange 
[or return; or to the word signifying that for 
which a substitute is given, or for which a thing is 
given or done in exchange or return]; (Mughnee;) 
as in the saying, A A A4 kAjiil [I purchased it 
for a thousand dirhems]; (Mughnee, K; *) [and in 
the saying in the Kur ix. 112, <_s jAil kill j\ 

441 A u4 fAlAj A" 1 **' (lAiA Verily God hath 
purchased of the believers their souls and 
their possessions for the price of their having 
Paradise;] and 4AAI cjlilS [1 requited his 

beneficence with a like beneficence, or 
with double, or more], (Mughnee,) or kilili 

ajUAI [i requited him with the like, or with 
double the amount, or with more than double 
the amount, of his beneficence], (K,) but the 
former is preferable; (TA;) [and 44 A4 (s 
and A & c. in art. -A j) He served for, meaning 
in return for, the food of his belly;] and Yj blljj k* 
431 1 lA A [This is in return for that, (an 
explanation somewhat differing from one in the 
next preceding division of this paragraph,) and 
no blame is imputable to fortune]: and 

hence, 04*4 ^i±£, 4 AJI I jli.il [Enter ye Paradise 
in return for that which ye wrought (Kur xvi. 
34)]; for the m here is not that which denotes a 
cause, as the Moatezileh assert it to be, and as all 
[of the Sunnees] hold it to be in the saying of 
the Prophet, 4-A AJI 4*4 JAij jl [before cited 
and explained]; because what is given instead of 
something is sometimes given gratuitously; and it 
is evident that there is no mutual opposition 
between the trad, and the verse of the Kur-an. 

(Mughnee.) It is also syn. with 34; and is 

said to be peculiar to interrogation; as in 3-Ai 



144 Digitized Text Version VI .1 


[BOOKI.] 


[And ask thou respecting Him, or it, one 
possessing knowledge (Kur xxv. 60)]; (Mughnee, 
K;) and accord, to IAar in the Kur lxx. l; (T;) and 
in the saying of ' Alkameh, ^3 4144 

? U41I ci j [And if ye ask me respecting 

the diseases of women, verily I am knowing in 
the diseases of women, skilful]: (A' Obeyd, TA:) 
or it is not peculiar to interrogation; as in f jjj 
f U»14 i'-4Jl 34^ [And the day when the heavens 
shall be rent asunder from the clouds (Kur xxv. 
2 7)]; (Mughnee, K) and 41 ji. 4 a (K) i. e. What 
hath beguiled thee from thy Lord, and from 
believing in him? in the Kur lxxxii. 6; and so in 
the same, lvii. 13: (TA: [but see art. j^:]) or, 
accord, to Z, the m in means by, as by an 
instrument; (Mughnee;) or it means because of, 
or by means of, the rising of the clouds 
therefrom: (Bd:) and in like manner the Basrees 
explain it as occurring in fy JUAa, 

as denoting the cause; and they assert that it is 
never syn. with Ip; but their explanation is 
improbable. (Mughnee.) — — It is also 
syn. with as in kiilj (Mughnee, K *) 
or (S) [If thou give him charge over a 

hundredweight or over a deenar (Kur iii. 
68)]; like as J&- is sometimes put in the place 
of sh as after the verb is^j: (S, TA:) and so in jl 
^jVI hi [That the ground were made even 
over them], in the Kur [iv. 45], (TA,) i. e. that 
they were buried; (Bd) and in 4-4 ^ [I passed 
by Zeyd], accord, to Akh, as before 
mentioned; (Mughnee, in the first division of the 
art. on this preposition;) and in jdaUb 4 j [Zeyd is 
on the roof]; (TA;) and in a verse cited in 
this Lex. voce 44*4 (Mughnee.) — — It also 
denotes part of a whole; (Msb in art. !_3 **j 
M ughnee, K;) so accord, to As and AAF and 
others; (Msb, Mughnee;) as syn. with 0* (Msb, 
TA:) IKt says; the Arabs say, »Uj 
meaning <ia [I drank of such a water]; and AZ 
mentions, as a saying of the Arabs, ? 1* 0* 3111 
liS, meaning <! [May God give thee to drink of 
such a water], thus making the two prepositions 
syn.: (Msb: [in which five similar instances are 
cited from poets; and two of these are cited also 
in the Mughnee:]) and thus it signifies in lie. 
<111 jUc [A fountain from which the 

servants of God shall drink, in the Kur lxxvi. 6; 
and the like occurs in lxxxiii. 28]; (Msb, 
Mughnee, K;) accord, to the authorities 
mentioned above; (Mughnee;) or the meaning is, 
with which the servants of God shall satisfy their 
thirst (3-? lS jo); (T, Mughnee;) or, accord, to Z, 
with which the servants of God shall drink wine: 
(Mughnee:) if the m were redundant, [as some 
assert it to be, (Bd,)] the meaning would be, that 


I _! 

they shall drink the whole of it; which is not 
right: (Msb:) thus, also, it is used in I >3— 4 3 
4^’)’jr [in the Kur v. 8], (Msb, Mughnee, K,) 
accord, to some; (Mughnee;) i. e. [And wipe ye] a 
part of your heads; and this explanation has been 
given as on the authority of EshShafi’ee; but he is 
said to have disapproved it, and to have held that 
the m here denotes adhesion: (TA:) this latter is 
its apparent meaning in this and the other 
instances: or, as some say, in this last instance it 
is used to denote the employing a thing as an aid 
or instrument, and there is an ellipsis in the 
phrase, and an inversion; the meaning 
being, »41L 4^jJ I [wipe ye your heads with 

water]. (Mughnee.) It is also used to denote 

swearing; (Mughnee, K;) and is the primary one 
of the particles used for this purpose; therefore it 
is peculiarly distinguished by its being 
allowable to mention the verb with it, (Mughnee,) 
as 0l*aV fiib [I swear by God I will assuredly 
do such a thing]; (Mughnee, K) and by its 
being prefixed to a pronoun, as in 4L [By 
thee I will assuredly do such a thing]; and by its 
being used in adjuring, or conjuring, for 
the purpose of inducing one to incline to that 
which is desired of him, as in 4 j ?4a Jj* yllfy 
meaning I adjure thee, or conjure thee, by God, 
to tell me, did Zeyd stand? (Mughnee.) [See also 
the first explanation of this particle, where it is 
said, on the authority of the L, that, when thus 

used, it denotes adhesion.] It is also syn. 

with as denoting the end of an extent or 
interval; as in ui meaning He did good, or 
acted well, to me: (Mughnee, K:) but some say 
that the verb here imports the meaning of 
[which is trans. by means of m, i. e. he acted 
graciously, or courteously, with me]. (Mughnee.) 

It is also redundant, (S, Mughnee, K,) to 

denote corroboration: (Mughnee, K:) and is 
prefixed to the agent: (Mughnee:) first, 

necessarily; as in 4 4 (Mughnee, K;) 

accord. to general opinion (Mughnee) 
originally 4 j u— i. e. c4^- ^ j 1 —* [Zeyd became 
possessed of goodness, or goodliness, or beauty]; 
(Mughnee, K; *) or the correct meaning is 4 j 0 “=“■ 
[Good, or goodly, or beautiful, or very good &c., 
is Zeyd! or how good, or goodly, or beautiful, is 
Zeyd!], as in the B: (TA:) secondly, in most 
instances; and this is in the case of the agent 
of as in <1% ^ [God sufficeth, being 
witness, or as a witness (Kur xiii., last verse; 
&c.)]; (Mughnee, K [and a similar ex. is given in 
the S, from the Kur xxv. 33;]) the m here 
denoting emphatic praise; but you may drop it, 
saying, 3111 (Fr, TA:) thirdly, in a case of 
necessity, by poetic licence; as in the saying, 4' 


ur4 uJ4 ^ [Did not what 

the milch camel of the sons of Ziyad experienced 
come to thee (‘443 being in like manner put 
for 44) when the tidings were increasing?]. 
(Mughnee, K.) It is also redundantly prefixed to 
the objective complement of a verb; as in Ijih V j 
4341 JJ 4444 [And cast ye not yourselves (4rt4 
meaning to perdition (Kur ii. 191)]; and 

in Aiijlt 43! isjk 'j [And shake thou towards 
thee the trunk of the palm-tree (Kur xix. 25)]: but 
some say that the former means and cast ye not 
yourselves (£Si«i2l being understood) with 
your hands to perdition; or that the meaning is, 
by means, or because, of your hands: (Mughnee:) 
and ISd says that isj4, in the latter, is 
made trans. by means of m because it is used in 
the sense of l s j 4: (TA in art j*:) so, too, in the 
saying, j*- ji j '-343 m [W e smite 

with the sword, and we hope for the removal of 
grief]: (S, Mughnee:) and in the trad., f 43 4 
U JSj (ji UiS [it suffices the man 

in respect of lying that he relate all that he has 
heard]. (Mughnee.) It is also redundantly 
prefixed to the inchoative; as in ' 44 [when you 
say, f* jj meaning A thing sufficing thee is 

a dirhem; a phrase which may be used in two 
ways; as predicating of what is sufficient, that it is 
a dirhem; and as predicating of a dirhem, that it 
is sufficient; in which latter case, is an 

enunciative put before its inchoative, so that the 
meaning is, a dirhem is a thing sufficing thee, i. e. 
a dirhem is sufficient for thee; as is shown in a 
marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee: in the 
latter way is used the saying, mentioned in the 
S, » jUl Jja i dn i A.i A thing sufficing thee is the 
saying what is evil: and so, app., each of the 
following sayings, mentioned in the TA on 
the authority of Fr; 3L34 < 4 1 1 3 A person 
sufficing thee is our friend; and 1433 4*3 A 
person sufficing thee is our brother: the m is 
added, as Fr says, to denote emphatic praise]: so 
too in 44 33 4 [I went forth, and lo, there, 

or then, was Zeyd]; and in 4 jlS lit 4L —34 
[How art thou, or how wilt thou be, when it is 
thus, or when such a thing is the case?]; and so, 
accord, to Sb, in 444 [mentioned before, in 

explanation of ‘-h as syn. with c^]; but Abu-1- 
Hasan says that ^44 is dependent upon 
suppressed, denoting the predicate of uj^ 1 ; and 
some say that this is an inf. n. in the sense of 
[so that the meaning may be, 444 In 

which of you is madness residing?]; or, as some 
say, sh is here syn. with j [as I have 
before mentioned], (Mughnee.) A strange case is 
that of its being added before that which is 
originally an inchoative, namely, the noun, or 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version V 1.1 145 


subject, of on the condition of its being 
transferred to the later place which is properly 
that of the enunciative; as in the reading of some, 
<jj4JI Jja IjIjj <j4 jJI <_>41xxx 

[Your turning your faces towards the east and the 
west is not obedience (Kur ii. 172 )]; with jJI in 
the accus. case. (Mughnee.) It is also redundantly 
prefixed to the enunciative; and this is in two 
kinds of cases: first, when the phrase is not 
affirmative; and cases of this kind may be 
followed as exs.; as 4 I 4 <j4 [Zeyd is not 

standing]; and u44i 14 Jslij Ikj [And God is 
not heedless of that which ye do (Kur ii. 69 , &c.)]: 
secondly, when the phrase is affirmative; and in 
cases of this kind, one limits himself to what has 
been heard [from the Arabs]: so say Akh and 
his followers; and they hold to be an instance of 
this kind the phrase, 44?) 4' 5^ [The 

recompense of an evil action is the like thereof 
(Kur x. 28 )]; and the saying of the 
Hamasee, [And the preventing 

thee from having her (referring to a mare) is a 
thing that is possible]: but it is more proper to 
make 4-4" dependent upon suppressed, as 

the enunciative; [the meaning being, ii jk 
4 - 4*4 jaiLi, or 414) J&*i, i. e. the recompense of 
an evil action is a thing consisting in the like 
thereof]; and to make dependent 

upon 4 ^*-“; the meaning being, Li ? <^-4 4iU4> j 
[j e an( j tjjg preventing thee from having 
her, by something, is possible: see Ham p. 102 ]: 
Ibn-Malik also [holds, like Akh and his followers, 
that 4 may be redundant when prefixed to the 
enunciative in an affirmative proposition; for he] 
says, respecting 4 j ^'44 , that is 

an inchoative placed after its enunciative, [so that 
the meaning is, Zeyd is a person sufficing thee,] 
because 4 j is determinate and 44k 

is indeterminate. (Mughnee. [See also what has 
been said above respecting the phrase 44 444 , 
in treating of 4 as added before the inchoative.]) 
It is also redundantly prefixed to the denotative 
of state of which the governing word is made 
negative; as in s <jj 44 k 44 j 444 j Us 
444 [And travelling-camels (meaning their 
riders) returned not disappointed, whose goal, or 
ultimate object, was Hakeem the son of El- 
Museiyab]; and in J£j V j ‘■'" V "' 4a [And 
thou didst not, being sent, or roused, go away 
frightened, nor impotent, committing thine affair 
to another]: so says Ibn-Malik: but AHei 
disagrees with him, explaining these two exs. as 
elliptical; the meaning implied in the former 
being, 4U 5-44 [with an object of want 
disappointed, or frustrated]; and in the 


second, ?jj>» a -^A *, i. e. jjc-u [with a 
person frightened]; the poet meaning, by 
the himself, after the manner of the 

saying, 1 4.1 <u Cul j; and this is plain with respect 
to the former ex., but not with respect to the 
second; for the negation of attributes of dispraise 
denoted as intensive in degree does not 
involve the negation of what is simply essential in 
those attributes; and one does not say, ku Cm! 
I4«l, or 1 34, [or l4«l 4* Cjjl j, as above, or >44] but 
when meaning to express an intensive degree of 
boldness, or of generosity. (Mughnee.) It is also 
redundantly prefixed to the corroborative 44 
and il4: and some hold it to be so in 414 
[as meaning Shall themselves wait (Kur ii. 
228 and 234 )]: but this presents matter for 
consideration; because the affixed pronoun in 
the nom. case, [whether expressed, as in this 
instance, in which it is the final syllable <j, or 
implied in the verb,] when corroborated 
by tj4j, should properly be corroborated first by 
the separate [pronoun], as in 44UI 4^ [Ye 
stood, ye, yourselves]; and because 
the corroboration in this instance is lost, since it 
cannot be imagined that any others are here 
meant than those who are commanded to wait: 
[the preferable rendering is, shall wait to see 
what may take place with themselves:] Os-44 is 
added only for rousing them the more to wait, 
by making known that their minds should not be 
directed towards the men. (Mughnee.) Accord, to 
some, it is also redundantly prefixed to a 
noun governed in the gen. case [by another 
preposition]; as in <4 <>* 4114 V o44ii And they 
became in a condition in which they asked 
him not respecting his father; which may perhaps 
be regarded by some as similar to the 
saying, 441' .sjjllS jc. 0 ^44: but in this 
instance, 4 is generally held to be a noun, syn. 
with J4]. (The Lubab, TA.)— — Sometimes it is 
understood- as in -*4 [i. e. <111 

and 0 14V 411 By God, I will assuredly do such a 
thing; in the latter as well as the former, for a 
noun is often put in the accus. case because of 
a preposition understood; or, accord, to Bd, in ii. 
1 , a verb significant of swearing is understood]: 
and in [for ji 4 In a good state], addressed to 
him who says, C'44i i 4jS [How hast thou 
entered upon the time of morning? or How hast 
thou become?]. (TA.) — — [It occurs also in 
several elliptical phrases; one of which (j 
kj"j) has been mentioned among the exs. of its 
primary meaning: some are mentioned in other 
arts.; as ^44 and <jrA4, fo arts. 4 and 4: and 
there are many others, of which exs. here follow.] 


Mohammad is related, in a trad., to have said, 
after hitting a butt with an arrow, 4 4 4 4, 
meaning 111 [I am the doer of it! I am the 

doer of it!]. (Sh, T.) And in another trad., 
Mohammad is related to have said to one who 
told him of a man's having committed an 
unlawful action, 414 4UJ, meaning 41»1 
jiVI i4 . 4» [May-be thou art the doer of that 
thing]. (T.) And in another, he is related to have 
said to a woman brought to him for having 
committed adultery or fornication, 4 j 
meaning j* [Who was thine accomplice?]: 

(T:) or 4 JeUll ji [Who was the agent with 
thee?]. (TA.) 41j 4 4, occurring in a form of 
prayer, means I seek, or take, refuge in Thee; or 
by thy right disposal and facilitation I worship; 
and to Thee, not to any other, I humble myself. 
(Mgh in art. I 4 .) One says also, LA J 04 
meaning Who will be responsible, answerable, 
amenable, or surety, to me for such a thing? (Har 
p. 126 : and the like is said in p. 191 .) And similar 
to this is the saying, 4L meaning 4 j-4' <44 
[It is as though I saw thee]; i. e. I know from what 
I witness of thy condition to-day how thy 
condition will be to-morrow; so that it is 
as though I saw thee in that condition. (Idem p. 
126 .) [You also say, 4 -4151, meaning Thou art so 
near to him that it is as though thou sawest him: 
or it is as though thou wert with him: i. e. thou 
art almost in his presence.] — — The Basrees 
hold that prepositions do not supply the places of 
other prepositions regularly; but are imagined to 
do so when they admit of being differently 
rendered; or it is because a word is sometimes 
used in the sense of another word, as in 4lu 44 s 
j41' meaning <jjjj, and in <4 0 * 4.1 meaning 4U; 
or else because they do so anomalously.

(Lth, T, M,) or to a child; (Fr, S, M;) and in like 
manner to his horse, for having saved him from

[of] one uniform way or mode or manner,

Fs, on the authority of ISd in the book entitled 
El-'Awees; (TA;) i. e., in respect of gifts,

inflected, (S, K,) like (S,) [having only one

its original application, (S, K,) i. e. from u-Ay 
signifying LAjj [he found, met with, 

or experienced, distress, &c.], to signify dispraise 
or blame. (S, TA.) When it is accompanied by a 
gen. n. without the article J, this is always in the 
accus. case: but when the n. has the article J', it 
is always in the nom. case: (TA:) you say, A-kj u-A

elliptical, and meaning, <4 ^ jyAll 

jy*A [Excellent is the journeying upon an ass

its cage, so that it sees therein its own form, and 
they speak to it from behind the mirror,

his property with that of a woman, coveting the 
possession of it, and thinking that she was stupid, 
and that she did not take care of her property nor 
know it: then he made a division with her, after 
he had mixed; but she was not content with the 
division until she took her property: she 
complained of him to those in authority, so that 
he released himself from her by giving her what 
she desired of the property: and the man was 
reproved for his conduct; it being said to him, 
“Thou cheatest a woman: is not this wrongful 
conduct (Ah)? ” whereupon he replied in the

in poetry, and in answering, or replying: pi. jjI 4:

and jy4, each in two places, £4ii: see £4 and iy4, 
each in two places. i 3 4, inf. n. 314: see 2, in 
three places. 2 3j)4 properly signifies [The 
changing, or altering, a thing; or] the changing, 
or altering, the form, or fashion, or semblance, or 
the quality, or condition, [of a thing,] to another 
form, &c., while the substance remains the same; 
(Th, T, TA;) or the changing a thing from its 
state, or condition; (Ibn-'Arafeh, TA;) or the 
changing a thing without substitution: (S:) hut 
the Arabs have used it also in the sense of { 3I4J, 
(Mbr, T, TA,) which signifies [the changing a 
thing by substitution; exchanging it; replacing it 
with another thing; or] the removing, or 
displacing, the substance [of a thing], and 
introducing anew another substance. (Th, T, TA.) 
You say, <44, inf. n. (M, * Msb, K,) meaning 
I changed it, or altered it; (M, K) or I changed, 
or altered, the form, or fashion, or semblance, or 
the quality, or condition, of it; (Msb;) as in the 
phrase, <4ki4 cJjj [i changed, or altered, the 
signet-ring into the simple ring], said when one 
has melted the former and made of it a simple 
ring; (Fr, T, TA;) and CilliUl 4Sll J4 [God 

changed the evil deeds into good deeds]; the verb 
being doubly trans. by itself because it has the 
meaning of 344 and (Msb. [But see what 
follows.]) I I<4j <44i, [in the S, 
without explanation,] inf. n. 3% [I changed it 
by substituting for it such a thing, or exchanged it 
for such a thing, or replaced it with such a thing,] 
is said when one has removed the first, and put 
the second in its place; (Msb;) as in the 
phrase, <4=)4 cJii [i changed the signet- 
ring by substituting for it the simple ring; 
exchanged the signet-ring for the simple ring; or 
replaced the signet-ring with the simple ring]; 
said when one removes the one, and puts the 
other in its place: (Fr, T, TA:) and this verb is also 
made doubly trans. by itself, like <44, (Msb,) 
which is used in the sense of <441 [as shown 
above]; (Mbr, T, TA;) for instance, where it is 
said, [in the Kur lxvi. 5,] <14^ J u44i, u! V 3 
u 4L> ljj4 14jjl [May-be, his Lord, if he divorce 
you, will give him in exchange wives better 
than you]; accord to one reading, <!4i (Msb.) An 
ex. of the latter of these two verbs in the sense of 
the former is the saying in the Kur [xxv. 70], 34j 
^44 <111 [God will change their evil deeds 
by substituting for them good deeds]; i. e. will 
cancel the evil deeds and put in their place good 


deeds: but in the saying in the Kur [iv. 59], LJS 
U jji Ifyl4 c i>wii [Whenever their 

skins are thoroughly burned, we will change the 
condition thereof to them into the condition of 
other skins], the meaning is, that the first 
condition of their skins shall be restored; so that 
the substance is one, but the condition is 
different. (Mbr, T, TA.) You say also, i> <41 <14 
Uil <-ij41l [God gave him in exchange for fear, or 
in lieu of fear, security]. (S.) [And 114 <14 He 

gave him in exchange for it, or in lieu of it, such a 
thing: see Kur xxxiv. 15. And 1 4 <44i 34 He gave 
in exchange for it, or in lieu of it, such a thing: see 
Kur vii. 93 and xvi. 103.] f j* 3 <4 44a. 34, in the 
Kur [xxvii. 11], means He hath done good [by way 
of exchange after evil]; i. e., repented; (Jel;) or 34 
<jj44 <4< [hath exchanged his sin for repentance]. 
(Bd.) 3 j) 4 and J, 3l4j both signify The act 
of exchanging [a thing for another thing]; or 
making [a thing] to be a substitute [for another 
thing]; (KL, PS;) and so does J. 314. (KL.) 
You say, o? »^“11 34, (M, K, *) and J, <4> 
<1-4, i. e. <“ iiijl [here meaning He exchanged 
the thing for the thing; or, more literally, he 
made the thing a substitute for the thing]. (M, K.

explained above, I exchanged the garment, or 
piece of cloth, for another; or made it to be a

the same. (Msb. [But the latter phrase has 
more frequently another meaning, explained 
below: see 10.]) [J, <14 in the phrases 14 <41 as 
meaning He changed it into, or substituted for 
it, such a thing, and 14 j* <14 as meaning he 
changed it from, or substituted it for, such a 
thing, is more common than <14, which is used in 
the same sense; as J, <12 is also; for] AO applies 
the term [ 3j4> [in lieu of the more common 
term 4 344] to a letter that is changed from 
another letter, as in <1*4 for <4:u; and this shows 
that ■— Jij is trans. [and signifies I changed, &c.]. 
(Az, TA.) 3 <144 and 4 3 42 signify the same, (S,) 
namely, The act of exchanging with another or 
others. (PS.) You say, <1-4, inf. n. <44 and J4 [in 


the CK erroneously written with fet-h to the <j],

instance, a garment, or piece of cloth, in the place 
of another; (Lth, T, Msb, * in explanation of 
the former inf. n.;) and a brother in the place of a 
brother. (Lth, T.) And J. Y2U2 They exchanged, or 
made an exchange, each with the other; or each 
gave to the other the like of that which he took, or 
received, from him. (TA.) <1)45, ending a verse of

signifies Cold water which one pours upon his

the accommodation of travellers and their beasts, 
or in a which is a house or the like specially 
appropriated to messengers and the beasts that 
carry them: thus it signifies a postmule: 
afterwards, it was applied also to a posthorse, 
and any beast appointed for the conveyance of 
messengers]: (Mgh:) [this is what is meant by the 
words in the S and K, mjjUI jjj) 1I:] it is a word of 
Persian origin, (Z in the Faik,) arabicized, 
from »ALW, (Z in the Faik, and Mgh,) i. e. 
"docked,” or “having the tail cut off;” for the post- 
mules (Al^ 1 Jlif) had their tails cut off in order 
that they might be known: (Z in the Faik:) 
[or perhaps it is from the Hebrew 71f “a mule:”] 
or it is applied to the beast appointed for the 
conveyance of messengers (Ao^ 1 ^|j) because he 
traverses the space called Ao) [defined below: but 
the reason before given for this appellation is 
more probable: it is like the Lat. “veredus”]: (T, 
Msb:) pi. ~y (Z, Mgh, Msb) and Aw, which is 
a contraction of the former, like as ct j is of ct j. 
(Z.) You say, ^ [Such a one was 

borne on the postmule or post-horse]. (S.) Imra- 
el-Keys speaks of a Alw of the horses of Barbar. 
(S.) — — Having been originally used in the 


sense first explained above, it was afterwards 
applied to A messenger borne on a post-mule [or 
post-horse]: (Z in the Faik, and Mgh:) or 
messengers on beasts of the post: (M, K:) or a 
messenger that journeys with haste: (A:) or 
[simply] a messenger: (S, Msb, K:) pi. as above. 
(M, * Z.) Hence the saying, Fever 

is the messenger of death: (T, Msb:) because it 
gives warning thereof. (T.) Hence also Ao^ 1 
applied to The animal called jjljill, (said to be 
the jackal, but some say otherwise, TA,) because 
he gives warning before [the approach of] the 
lion. (T, S, K.) And [The master of the 

messengers that journey on post-mules or post- 
horses]. (S.) [And Aj^ 1 occurring in many 
histories &c., The post-horses, that carry 
messengers and others.] — — Also, having 
been applied to a messenger on a post-mule [or 
post-horse], it then became applied to The space, 
or distance, traversed by the messenger 
thus called; (Mgh, Msb; *) the space, or distance, 
between each and the next to it; the 
being a structure of either of the kinds called ‘-y 
and 4 ) 2 , or a [explained above], in which the 
appointed messengers lodge; (Z in the Faik;) the 
space, or distance, between two stations, or 
places of alighting; or two parasangs, or leagues; 
(M, K;) [six miles;] each parasang, or league, 
being three miles, and each mile being four 
thousand cubits: (TA:) or twelve miles; (S, A, 
Msb, K;) i. e. four parasangs, or leagues: (Mgh, 
TA:) [for] the space, or distance, between each 
station termed and the next to it is either 
two parasangs or four: (Z in the Faik:) the 
distance of twelve miles is [also] termed Au^ 1 
(T:) the pi. is as above. (T, Z.) A journey 
of four J y, or forty-eight miles, renders it 
allowable to shorten prayers; which miles are of 
the Hashimee measure, such as are measured on 

the road to Mekkeh. (T.) Also The course, or 

pace, of a camel along the space thus called: so in 
the following verse of Muzarrid, in praise of 
'Arabeh El-Owsee: j j fjill m 1 Ip 
l*Aj) [May my mother, and my 

maternal aunt, and my she-camel that is swift in 
her course to thee from one station to another, be 
ransoms for thee, O 'Arabeh, (the name being 
contracted,) this day!]. (S.) Filings; (M, Mgh, 
K;) what falls from iron [&c.] when filed.

a shelf, upon which mugs (u 1 IS, pi. of jjS,) are 
placed; erroneously in the K, O'ja and as I 
find it in different copies;] upon which water is 
cooled: (Lth, T, K: *) but [Az says,] I know not 


whether it be a classical or a post-classical 
word. (T.) Hence the saying, ^ 

Their mugs passed the night upon the »■>!]«. (A, 
TA.) A)L (S, M, Msb, K) Cold; chill; cool; (S,

one also says, -SjA j lA Ah He fell, or set

of a man praying, which is forbidden, is The 
putting down the hands before the knees, after 
the manner of the camel [when he lies down; for 
the latter falls first upon his knees, and then 

upon his stiflejoints]. (Mgh.) Hence, i. e., 

from the verb said of a camel, inf. n. ^ jjj, (TA,)

Mohammad &c.: though it may well be rendered 
simply bless or beatify &c.:] Az says that it is 
from Ah said of a camel, meaning “he lay down 
upon his breast in a place and clave thereto.” 
(TA.) And AA 1 A A AU fA, in another trad., 
means [O God, bless us] in the state to which 
death will bring us. (TA.) The Arabs say to the 
beggar, A A_H [Mayest thou be blest; and, in 
the present day, A A A A God bless thee]; 
meaning thereby to repel him; not to pray for 
him: and by reason of frequency of usage of 
this phrase, they have made J, A-H a noun: a poet 
[in Har ls .A 1 AA (app. Sherees, not Shereesh, 
El-’Adawee), in the TA Aboo-Fir’own,] 
says, AA UAh A A tij Aj A.H o' A 2 [She

meaning He blessed him; i. e. he prayed God to 

bless him.] See also 6. 4 Ah' He made him 

(namely, a camel,) to lie down [or kneel and lie 
down] upon his breast. (S, K.) You say, Ajjl 
I made him to lie down upon his breast, and he 
lay down upon his breast: but this is rare: the 
more common phrase is Aji. (s.) — See 

also 8. — All '- i [How blessed is he, or it!] is an 
instance of a verb of wonder with a passive

i. q. Ah [He had a blessing; and he was, or

that JA is trans. and is intrans.: (S:) 

accord, to IAmb, it means [that] one looks for a 
blessing by means of [uttering] his name ( diAn 
Ate) in every affair, or case: accord, to Lth, it is 
a phrase of glorification and magnification: (TA:) 
or d! jU; signifies He is abundant in good; 
from AA which is “abundance of good:” or 
He exceeds everything, and is exalted above it, in 
his attributes and his operations; because AA 
implies the meaning of increase, accession, or 
redundance: or He is everlasting; syn. A; 
from All A Alh [“the continuing of the 
birds at the water”]; whence AA because of the 
continuance of the water therein: the verb is 
invariable [when thus used, being considered as 
divested of all signification of time, or used in an 
optative sense]; and is not employed [in any of 
the senses above] otherwise than in relation to

God. (K.) A jA see 5. 8 Ah' He (a

classical; the correct word, they say, being »jii: 
(Msb:) this they assert on the ground of the

firmest, strongest, or most valid, evidence or 
proof; which is such as ever necessarily implies 
truth, or veracity, as its consequence, 
or concomitant; for evidences, or proofs, are of 
five sorts; whereof this is one; another is that 
which ever necessarily implies falsity, 
or falsehood, as its consequence, or concomitant; 
another, that which is nearer to truth, or veracity; 
another, that which is nearer to falsity, or 
falsehood; and another, that which is 
intermediate between these two: (Er-Raghib, 
TA:) [pi. ufe y-] some say that the u in this word 
is augmentative; (Msb, and Ham p. 7;) that it is 
of the measure from » fel [app. »jill] 

signifying the “act of cutting:” (Ham ubi

both of these opinions: J confines himself to the 
latter opinion: Z, to the former, saying, on 
the authority of IAar, that the word is derived 
from ^y'y, meaning “white,” [or “fair in 
complexion,”] applied to a girl: (Msb:) Abu-l-Fet-

measure like cfetijs and the j not 

being augmentative, as is shown by the verb

less than three nor more than ten; (Sh [the first

says Sgh; [and the like is said in the Msb;] in the 
K, erroneously, jjfc; (TA;) because it means 
a portion, (Sgh, K,) which is undefined: 
(Sgh, TA:) it also signifies, with ten, [in like 
manner; i. e. ten and a number under ten; or the 
like: as] from thirteen to nineteen. (Msb.) When 
used as signifying from three to nine, (Mgh, 
Msb,) or to ten, or to seven, (Mgh,) [or to signify 
some number under ten, without another n. of

used to denote a number above ten, (Mgh, Msb,)

When you have passed the word denoting ten,

(Msb,) it is not used: (S, Msb, K:) you do not 
say Jj'yyj iy, (S, K,) but Jj'y-j “4; and so

Africa, and still more so in the Hottentot race, 
grows to an extraordinary size; and this may be 
the reason why the jl4 is described by some 
travellers as a caruncle for which we have 
no name: or it may, perhaps, be a distinct 
excrescence from the prepuce of the clitoris: it 
has been described to me as a caruncle a little 
in front of the meatus urinarius: many of the 
Egyptians assert that it is the clitoris itself that is 
amputated, (as Ludolph also does in 
his Comment, to his Ethiop. Hist. p. 273 , finding 
fault with those who say otherwise;) and they 
affirm that this is done for the purpose 
of lessening the libidinous passion: such, indeed, 
appears to be the case in some instances, but not 
generally; and it may have led to a misapplication 
of the term ji 4 in post-classical times: an 
analogous practice, one still more barbarous, is 
said to have obtained among an African race 
hence called the Colobi: see jjj): Abu-l-Kasim 
Ez-Zahrawee speaks of the amputation of the 
redundance of the ji4 when pretematurally 
large, and also of an excrescence in the vulva: 
the former he describes in such a manner as 
plainly shows that he means thereby the clitoris: 
the latter, in terms apparently indicating 
a preternatural elongation of the lower part of the 
prepuce of the clitoris; as “ an excrescence of 
flesh at, or in, the mouth of the vulva, such as fills 
it up, and sometimes protrudes externally, like 
a tail, wherefore the ancients term it the caudal 
disease u== j4l; and this,” he says, “ should 

be amputated, like as the ji 4 is amputated ” 
when pretematurally large: (Albucasis de 

Chirurgia, pp. 314 and 316 :) in some of our 
medical books, the term “ caudatio ” is defined as 
“ an elongation of the clitoris; ” inconsistently

the words of the Kur [xl. 29], f£->3 ji3

threats; without denying the punishment of 
the world to come: or, as Aboo-Is-hak says, he 
mentions the part to indicate the necessary 
consequence of the whole: and as to the saying of 
Lebeed, by he means himself. (TA

to the latter, it is a well-known kind of aquatic 
bird, so called because it is of the colour 
termed dd, i. e. white inclining to

is any bird that is not one of prey: and the word 
is said to be a coll. gen. n., signifying the class of 
birds that are objects of prey: (TA:) ISk says that 
the did is a bird of a colour inclining to that of 
dust, (S, Msb, *) a little less than the dd^j 
[or vultur percnopterus], (S,) or less than 
the d-L j, (Msb,) slow in flight: (S, Msb:) but IB 
says that this is a mistake in two points of 
view; first, because did is a [coll.] gen. n., of 
which the n. un. is with », like as is that of fLd; 
and secondly, because it applies to the class of 
birds that do not prey; but the J, ddi is a bird of 
the colour of dust, and this may be a bird of prey, 
and it may be not a bird of prey: (TA:) AZ says

young ones of the j and birds of the crowkind: 
or [birds] like the [hawks called] [pi.

[a kind of bird] like the [hawk called] jdU, that 
does not prey upon any other bird: (TA:) or did

[or most ignoble] of birds, (ISd, K, [the latter 
giving this as a second and 
distinct signification,]) and such as do not prey: 
(ISd, TA:) Fr says, Judl did signifies the worst of 
birds, and such as do not prey; and did

S, Msb, K,) accord, to those who make did a

accord, to Er-Raghib, it is of two kinds: one of 
these is approved, and this is the passing beyond 
the bounds of equity to exercise beneficence, and 
beyond the bounds of obligatory duties to do 
what is not obligatory: the other is disapproved, 
and this is the passing beyond the hounds of that 
which is true, or right, to do that which is false, or 
wrong, or to do acts of a doubtful nature: but in

Also, aor. ls*), (TA,) inf. n. i*), (Az, TA,) He 
magnified himself; or behaved proudly,

manageable. (Er-Raghib, TA.) Accord, to some, 
this verb is not used in the pret. tense, but only in 
the aor.: it is reckoned among verbs imperfectly 
inflected: (Msb, TA:) but the pret. is mentioned

that the animal thus called is another species of 
bovine antelope, or perhaps a variety of the 
former; it is said to be what is termed by Pallas 
antilope bubalis; by others, alcephalus bubalis, or 
acronotus bubalis; and this is said to 
come occasionally to the Nile: but the Arabic 
appellations given above are employed with 
much laxity: thus we find 33 explained as

different species: the first called 4-? [i. e. 3-“, a

thus differing from the horns of other animals, 
for their horns are hollow: when it hears singing, 
and the sounds of musical instruments, it listens 
thereto, and then it takes no care to guard itself 
from the arrows, by reason of its intense delight 
therein: when it raises its ear, it hears sounds; 
and when it relaxes it, it hears not anything. 
(Kzw: also cited by De Sacy, ubi supra.) The 
Arabs regard Ji [meaning Jk] as ominous

the lamenting, or grieving. (Kh, TA.) Ay and Ay 
[maybe inf. ns. of us^ or of i y , and] signify the 
same as Ay or much y [or weeping, &c.]: (K:) 
MF asserts that Ay (with kesr) and the former 
of these explanations are unknown; but both the 
word and the explanation are mentioned by Lh, 
as used in a form of words uttered by Arab 
women of the desert to fascinate men: ISd, 
however, says that it should be <^y , because it is 
an inf. n. of a class formed to denote muchness 
[of the attribute signified by the verb], like jy 
and &c.; and IAar says that Ay, with fet-h, 
has the latter of the two significations assigned to 
it above. (TA.) [See what is said of the 
measure 3y voce oS.] You say, <1 y (MF, TA) 
and y , (s, Msb, K, MF,) meaning [He wept] 
for, or over, him, or it: and only y [or thus 
and also <iy as appears from what follows] 
when meaning [He wept] because, or in 
consequence, of it: (Tnayeh, MF, TA:) and AS) 
and l All), (As, AZ, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. of the 
former AtiJ (K) [and isl], and of the latter <y, 
(TA,) signify the same as y ; (As, AZ, S, Msb, 

* K;) the object being a man: (As, S:) and (or as 
some say, TA) he wept for, or over, him, i. e., one 
dead; or did so, and enumerated his good 
qualities or actions; syn. AIj j : (K:) or, as some 
say, AS) means [he wept because, or in 
consequence, of it, i. e.,] on account of being 
pained: and -y y , [he wept for, or over, him,] 
by reason of tenderness of heart, or compassion: 
and [hence] it is said that <444 is originally y4 
<-“: (TA:) [and J, Al£) may have an intensive, or a 
frequentative, meaning; for it is said that] y , 
addressed to the eye, signifies weep thou much, 

and repeatedly. (Ham p. 461.) [Hence,] cy 

(assumed tropical:) The cloud rained. 
(Msb.) — — y also means He sang: [in the 
CK, y is erroneously put for y yj:] 
thus it has two contr. significations: (K, TA:) 
accord, to MF, it has this meaning only in 
relation to the pigeon and the like; but it is also 
used in this sense when said of a man, as in a 
verse cited voce » jy , q. v. : and he observes that 
the assertion of its having two contr 
significations requires consideration, seeing that 
it is also said to signify y>; [for in the 
performance of Ajj, it is a common practice to 
sing;] but Ajj is generally accompanied by 
lamentation, and A)? by rejoicing. (TA.) — —

The camels went on seeking the herbage, or

particle of digression: (Mughnee, K:) or, accord, 
to Mbr, it denotes emendation, wherever it 
occurs, in the case of a negation or an 
affirmation: (T, TA:) or it is a word 

of emendation, and denoting digression from 
that which precedes; as also uj, in which the u is a 
substitute for the J, because 3 is of 
frequent occurrence, and Cs is rare; or, as IJ says, 
the latter may be an independent dial. var. (M.) 
When it is followed by a proposition, 
the meaning of the digression is either the 
cancelling of what precedes, as in 0 ^-jl 1 441 1 

Jjc Jj AjUIL lllj [And they said, 
“The Compassionate hath gotten offspring: ” 
extolled be his freedom from that which is

hath purified himself, and celebrated the name of 
his Lord, and prayed: but ye prefer the 
present life (Kurlxxxvii. 14 - 16 )]: (Mughnee, K: *) 
and in all such cases it is an inceptive particle; 
not a conjunctive. (Mughnee.) When it is 
followed by a single word, it is a conjunction, (S, 

* Msb, * Mughnee, K,) and requires that word to 

be in the same case as the word before it: (S:) and 
if preceded by a command or an affirmation, 
(Mughnee, K,) as in I j H Jj lilj [Beat thou 

Zeyd: no, 'Amr], (Msb, Mughnee, K,) and ^ 
jjie Jj ij [Zeyd stood: no, ’Amr], (M, Mughnee, 
K,) or ifyl 3; iiji-i [Thy brother came to me: 
no, thy father], (S,) it makes what precedes it to 
be as though nothing were said respecting it, (S, * 
Msb, * Mughnee, K,) making the command or 
affirmation to relate to what follows it: (S, * Msb, 

* Mughnee:) [and similar to these cases is the 
case in which it is preceded by an interrogation: 
see as syn. with this particle:] but when it is 
preceded by a negation or a prohibition, it is used 
to confirm the meaning of what precedes it and 
to assign the contrary of that meaning to what 
follows it, (Mughnee, K,) as in 

j "J**- [Zeyd stood not, but 'Amr stood], 
(Mughnee,) or I j H 3) lllj 4 il j U, [I saw not 
Zeyd, but I saw ’Amr], (S,) and Jj 4j V 
[Let not Zeyd stand, but let 'Amr stand]. 
(Mughnee.) Mbr and 'Abd-El-Warith allow 


its being used to transfer the meaning of the 
negation and the prohibition to what follows it; 
so that, accord, to them, one may say, J) '-“A'-l 4 J-i 
^13 [as meaning Zeyd is not standing: no, is not 
sitting], and ^15 Jj [but is sitting]; the meaning 
being different [in the two cases]. (Mughnee, K. 
*) The Koofees disallow its being used as a 
conjunction after anything but a negation [so in 
the Mughnee, but in the K a prohibition,] or the 
like thereof; so that one should not say, 4 jj 4 a 
Uly] Jj Ijyj [I beat Zeyd: no, thee]. (Mughnee, K.) 
Sometimes V is added before it, to corroborate 
the meaning of digression, after an affirmation, 
as in the saying, jl jj Jj V (pjll ifylj 

J^ai j [xhy face is the full moon: no, 

but it would be the sun, were it not that eclipse

have not abandoned thee: no, but abandonment

used to denote the passing from one subject to

the meaning is, By the Kur-an possessed of 
eminence, verily they who have disbelieved are in

oath applies to it. (Akh, S.) Sometimes the 

Arabs use it in breaking off a saying and 
commencing another; and thus a man 
commences with it a citation, or recitation, of 
verse; in which case, it does not form any part of 
the first verse, but is a sign of the breaking off, or 
ending, of what precedes. (Akh, S.) — —

Mughnee,) as in the saying of the rajiz, Jj

originally of three letters] is unknown; and so in 
the cases of 3* and it may be a final j or is or 
they may be originally Jj and 3* and Ja. (Akh, S.)

j4» [Thou hast distressed us, or afflicted us, in

that the war harassed her, and distressed her in 
the utmost degree. (TA.) It is like 
[and ue-341] and all meaning 

calamities, misfortunes, or disasters: (A'Obeyd, 
TA:) and is as though they said j4 4 [and j4], 
meaning j4, and then formed the pi. thus 
because they considered calamities [as 
personified, i. e.,] as rational beings 
having purpose, or design. (IAth, TA.) It is 
invariably thus, terminating with lS and u: or one 
may say in the nom. case jj*4it, and in the accus.

[lit. He caused him to come, i. e. he brought him,

is, lS Of, i. e., jJ+4l ; [of those who have the 
office of communicating, or announcing,] the 
simple subst. being put in the place of the inf. 
n.: (K, TA:) but some relate it differently, saying 
1 £.30 Of [of the communicators, or announcers,] 
like l — in the sense of (TA:) and some 

say, l £30 Of, meaning jj43ll 3 j*J44I Of, i. e. 
of those who do their utmost in communicating, 
or announcing. (Hr, K.) [See this trad, cited and 
explained more fully in the first paragraph of

mention of the noun qualified by it, by Esh- 
Shafi’ee (T, Msb) and other chaste persons, of the 
Arabs; (T, TA;) or 4JU; (IKoot, Msb;) or the latter 
is also thus applied, with the mention of the noun 
which it qualifies, (T, Msb, K,) not being 
wrong because it is the original form; (T, TA;)

noun, meaning p and Pp (IAth, TA;) and the 
noun that follows it, when it is thus used, is in the 
accus. case; (Mughnee, K;) i. e. it is indecl., with 
fet-h for its termination, when the noun following 
it is in the accus. case; so that you say, P j P [Let 
alone Zeyd, or say nothing of Zeyd]; like as you 
say, Pj Pj: (IB, TA:) and it is also an inf. n. in 
the sense of PP; likewise with fet-h for its 
termination, but deck; and when it is thus used, 
the noun that follows it is in the gen. case; 
(Mughnee, K;) or it is put in the place of an inf. 
n., meaning 3 ip [which is virtually the same 
as pl and p], and is prefixed to a noun in the 
gen. case; so that you say, P P, i. e. P 3 ip

above; for P 3 ip is originally l£p Pj 31 pi, like 
as pa pl Mp-^ in the Kur xlvii. 4 

is originally iP pipl I ^jp=lj]; (IAth, TA;) for in 
this case it cannot be regarded as a verbal noun, 



258 Digitized Text Version VI .1 


[BOOKI.] 


since verbal nouns are not prefixed to other 
nouns, governed by them in the gen. case: (IB, 
TA:) and it is also a noun syn. with —4 [How?]; 
likewise with fet-h for its termination, indecl.; 
and when it is thus used, the noun that follows it 
is in the nom. case. (Mughnee, K.) A poet says, 
describing swords, (S, Mughnee,) namely, Kaab 
Ibn-Malik, (S,) 434) iliSSfl 53) 444 JI jjj 

jlij [They leave the skulls with their crowns 
lying open to the sun (let alone, or say nothing of, 
the hands) as though they had not been created]: 
(S, Mughnee:) he says, when they cut, or cut off, 
the crowns, then let alone, or say nothing of, the 
hands (4&VI g-is): 1 . e., they are more fit for 
cutting off the hands: (TA:) Akh says that <4 is 
here in the place of an inf. n.; that it is as when 
you say, f)j but 4iSVI may be in the accus. 

case; so that the meaning may be 4SVI £5; (S:) 
the verse is thus recited in two different ways: 
and also it [how then must be the case of 
the hands?]. (Mughnee.) And hence the 
prov., ji aJj Ul jj q\ jUll 3 is 44 i. e. The fire 

will burn thee if thou see it from a distance: then 
let alone, or say nothing of, (£ 4 ) thy entering 
into it. (TA.) A strange instance occurs in the 
Saheeh of El-Bukharee, in the explanation of 
the fJi of the chapter of 54431 [the 32 nd ch. of the 
Kur]: he says, God says [by these three 
letters] 0 - ■~- JI j 0 ^ 4 4» 3L^a3l diaacl 

^jxilal U> <3) J ’‘-S *V J 

(Mughnee, K: *) or 43° ,43*33=1 U : ($o in some 
copies of the K:) thus 4 is used as a decl. word, 
governed in the gen. case by i>, and deviating 
from the three meanings [explained 

above]: (Mughnee, K:) but the reading commonly 
known is, -4^ ^ j 4 4 °; and this is 

the reading in the work of J, [the S,] and in the 
Nh, and other lexicological works: (TA:) it has 
been explained by j4; [so that the meaning of 
the sentence as first related above is, I have 
prepared for my righteous servants what eye hath 
not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it occurred to 
the mind of man, as a treasure for the future, 
(obviously taken from Isaiah lxiv. 4 , quoted by St. 
Paul in 1 Cor. ii. 9 ,) save, or except, that with 
which ye have become acquainted, or that with 
which I have acquainted them; and the same, 
with the omission of “ as a treasure for the future, 
“is the meaning of the sentence as related in the S 
and Nh &c.;] (Mughnee, K;) i. e. as in the S; 
(TA;) and this corroborates, (Mughnee,) or is 
agreeable with, (K,) the opinion of those who 
reckon 4 as an exceptive word: (Mughnee, K:) 
and as meaning 34 [app. a mistranscription 
for 34; i. e., it has been explained also as 
meaning I have done all this because of 


my promise to them; (44- »lh l U Jli j* 
because of that with which I have acquainted 
them;) and thus it may have been read by SM, for 
he has written 34 without any syll. signs; and has 
given no other ex. of 4 in the sense here 
intended except one commencing with the 
words, 0=“! P 4 1 “d), which may mean because 
I have not broken a covenant, or yea, verily I have 
not &c., accord, as we read 4' or 4]]: or 
as meaning 4$ [or rather 'is- 4S] and j) [let 
alone, or say nothing of; but this explanation 
must relate to the sentence as given in the S and 
Nh]: (K, but omitted in an excellent copy of that 
work:) or, accord, to El-Ahmar, it means, in this 
trad, [as commonly known], ‘4£ [how? 
which seems to be the least suitable of all these 
explanations]. (TA.) IAmb relates, on the 
authority of others, that <13 is also syn. 
with 44 [but I think that this is a mistake, 
arising from a misunderstanding of what here 
follows:] Fr says that he who makes it to govern a 
gen. case regards it as used in the manner of 44 
and similar particles governing the gen. case. 
(TA.) — — '3%i3 U means 4lL U [what is thy

him, or it: (Mgh, Msb:) or, as some say, <#)i V

said in the T:]) or the proper [or literal] meaning 
is, I will not, or I do not, contend with him for 
superiority in goodness, or excellence, by 
reason of my little care, or regard, for him: 
(Mgh:) or it was employed to denote the 
contending with another for superiority in glory, 
or excellence, as will be shown by the citation of a 
verse in the latter portion of this paragraph; and 
then, in consequence of frequency of usage, came 
to denote contempt, or mean estimation: (Ham 
p. 31:) or its original meaning is, I will not, or I do 
not, strive with him to be first; neglecting him, or 
leaving him to himself; from fjsll JL) 
as explained below; see 6. (Msb.) It is said in a 
trad., <il) <111 fj!)) V, or, accord, to one reading, V 


<1C JL), meaning God will not hold them to be

another, Vj jJl J ? V>j JLi Vj <1=JI J ?V>

verb is sometimes thus used, in an affirmative 
manner; (Ham p. 94; [and the like is said in the 
TA;]) though some say that it is not; (Msb;) but it 
is not unless it occurs with a negative in the 
former part of the sentence or in the latter part 
thereof; as when one says, LL JL U

thy slave cared]; and as in the saying of 
Zuheyr, V Jji JUj Jji p Jlii lLI!) S 
JJ [Verily I cared for the departure of Umm- 
Owfa, but Umm-Owfa cares not]. (Ham p. 94.) 
One says also, JLI j) and 3)1 fl [I did not care, 
&c.]: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K: [but in the CK the 
latter of these is omitted:]) in the latter the I [of 
prolongation] is suppressed for the purpose 
of alleviating the utterance, like as lS is 
suppressed in the inf. n. [or quasi-inf. n.] <!L, (s, 
Mgh, Msb,) originally JL, (S, Msb,) and in ji V: 
(S:) or the I is suppressed in this case to avoid the 
concurrence of two quiescent letters; (Kh, Sb, M, 
IB;) not for the purpose of alleviating the 
utterance; (IB, TA;) for this is done because the J 
is made quiescent. (Kh, Sb, M.) And, accord, to 
Kh, (Sb, M,) some of the Arabs say, Ji j) [I did 
not care for him, or it], (Sb, M,) or J)l p, [in the 
CK, erroneously, J)l J] with kesr to the J; (K,

as they do in [for jv^-]. (Sb, S, M.) — — 
LAar says that JL, inf. n. »VLi, is like J, J)i 
meaning He exerted himself in a description of a 
war, or battle, or of generous conduct; as when 
one says, L**^ 1 % ^ilj [He exerted himself 
well, that day, in a description of war, &c.]: and 
he cites the following verse [to which reference 
has been made above]: JIJ«JI ^ j [What

looking to see which of them [or of thee and 
others] is best in J4 [i. e. state, or condition],

her fore shank bound to her arm at the grave of

slaughter, at the grave: so in a trad. (TA.) Suh 
says that this custom proves that, in the Time of 
Ignorance, they held the doctrine of the

what is said [in that to which it is a reply]; (S, 
Msb;) [with very few exceptions] relating only to 
a negation, which it annuls: (Msb, Mughnee:) the 
final letter is a radical: or, accord, to some, the 
word is originally 3j, [after which an affirmation 
is to be understood,] and the final letter is 
augmentative: and some of these say that this 
letter is a denotative of the fem. gender, because 
it is [often] pronounced with imaleh. (Mughnee.) 
It is a reply to an interrogation in which is a 
negative, (T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) and affirms 
what is said to thee [in that interrogation]; (M, 
K;) whether it be an interrogation in the 
proper sense, (Mughnee,) as when you say to 
another, 3*4 ^11 [Didst thou not such a thing?], 
and he replies, [meaning Yes, or yea, or ay, 
I did], (T,) or as when one says, 4 j u-4" [Is 

not Zeyd standing?], and you reply, csh [Yes, he 
is]; or be meant to convey reproof, (Mughnee,) as 
in the Kur [lxxv. 3 and 4 ], 3 J ' ” > “ >1 

u4 [Doth man think that we will not collect 
his bones? Yes], (Msb, Mughnee,) i. e., we will

(Mughnee,) as in the Kur [vii. 171 ], ' jka 44 j” *4*1' 
cs4 [Am I not your Lord? They said, Yea]. 
(M, Mughnee.) It is also a reply to a simple 
negation, (Msb, Mughnee,) as when I say, 4 s U 
4 j [Zeyd did not stand, or has not stood], and 
you reply, J) as an affirmative [meaning Yes, he 
did, or he has]. (Msb.) It occurs in the Kur [xxxix. 
60 ], where it is said, 34' &i*tA 4 [Yea, my 
signs have come to thee], preceded by that which 
is not literally a negation, but which has the force 
of a negation; for the preceding saying, -dll 3 3 
3'^ [If God had directed me aright, or would 
that God &c.], is like the saying, *3?* [1 was not 

directed aright]. (M.) It also occurs in the books 
of traditions, in some instances, as a reply to an 
interrogation without a negative; but 
these instances are rare, and not to be followed in 
rendering revelation. (Mughnee.) Az says that 
when a man says to another, f jS VI [Wilt thou not 
stand?], and the latter replies, 34 he means 3) 
f jSI [Nay, I will stand], adding the alif [written ls] 
to make the pause good; for if he said, 3), the 
other would expect something more to be said 
after it. (TA.) It is said that the pronunciation 
termed imaleh is allowable in the case of 34 and 
if so, its final radical letter is ls: and some of the 
grammarians say that this pronunciation of 3 ^ is 
because, by reason of its completeness and 
independence of meaning, so that it

observations, “ ‘ Bendj, ’ the pi. of which in Coptic 
is ‘ nihendj, ’ is without doubt the same plant as 
the ‘ nepenthe, ’ which has hitherto so much 
perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen 
evidently brought the nepenthe from Egypt, and

this has [generally] for its [broken] pi. 3*3

be pi. of the measure 3*i and of 3*2; that >3 
favours its being of the latter; but that it may be

singly declinable, leaving the 0 with fet-h in every 
case [as the j in 'j*! or I j*']; saying, i33 li* [This

S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) accord, to Sb, (M,) 33 is 
formed from J)! by affixing » [or »]; but not so -J; 
for this is formed by affixing if as a letter 
of quasi-coordination, and then substituting for 
it 3 (M, K:) [but if the ^ be substituted for <s, it 
seems more probable that the lS is the 
final radical:] or, as some say, the cii is 


substituted for j: (M:) [Mtr says,] the ej is 
substituted for the final radical: (Mgh:) accord, to 
Ks, it is originally with » [or »], because it has a 
fem. meaning: (IAar, Msb:) [my own opinion is 
most agreeable with this of Ks; and with that of 
Zj, which will be mentioned below; or, perhaps, is 
identical with that of Zj: I think it most probable 
that, as oil is generally held to be originally 33 
or jjj, so ^3! and *— are both originally <3 
or »jjj, and that ^ij is formed from 3! by 
suppressing the alif, transferring its kesreh to 
the m, making the 0 quiescent, and changing the » 
into i -j, which is therefore said to be not the sign 
of the fem. gender, either because it is not », but 
is a substitute for », or because it is preceded by a 
quiescent letter:] AHn says that the ^ is 
substituted for the final radical letter, which is j; 
and that it is not the sign of the fem. gender, 
because the letter [next] before it is quiescent: 
this [he says] is the opinion of Sb, and is the right 
opinion; for he says that if you were to use it as 
the proper name of a man, you would make 
it perfectly deck; and if the cii were to denote the 
fem. gender, the name would not be perfectly 
deck: (TA:) and the same is said respecting the cii 

^ o i 

in (TA in art. 33) this ^ remains in a case 
of pause (Ks, IAar, S, Msb) as in the case of the 
connexion of the word with a word following: (S:) 
but one should not say ej3 ; (Th, T, S.) because 
the I is required only on account of the 
quiescence of the m, and is therefore dropped 
when this is made movent: (S:) Zj says that, in 
forming the pi. of ^ [and of 5 3'], the sing, is 
reduced to its original form, which is 3l»s [as I 
find it written in the transcript from the T in the 
TT, but it may be a mistake for 3J*i,] with the last 
radical letter suppressed: (T in TT:) the pi. is ^3 
(T, S, Msb) alone: (S:) [and this is generally 
treated as a fem. pi. of the perfect, or sound, 
kind, although the ej in ‘-tiL is said to be not a sign 
of the fem. gender; so that you say, >30 I 
saw thy daughters; but sometimes] one says, 30 
30, with fet-h [as the case-ending], treating 
the cj as a radical letter. (S.) It is said in the Bari' 
that when men and women are mixed together, 
the masc. pi. is made predominant; so that one 
says, 3 [meaning The sons and daughters, 
or the children, of such a one]; and even, i> 
g3 3 [A woman of the children of Temeem]; 
and accordingly, if jjj i s applied to denote the 
persons to whom a legacy is left, the males and 
the females are included therein. (Msb.) — — 
When o)! is applied to that which is not a human 
being, (IAmb, Msb,) to an irrational being,

in some copies of the K, the latter explanation

syn. <f f j% for the primary signification of £'jj is

meaning of this kind] according to the exigency 
of that case; as is said in the Nh, and expressly 
stated by Z and Er-Raghib: (TA:) or he 
acknowledged it, or confessed it. (M, K.) 

-3-4J j t » j" O', in the Kur v. 35, means Verily I

which thou hast committed previously: (Jel:) or I 
desire that thou shouldst bear (J*kj) my sin if I 
were to extend my hand towards thee, and thy sin 
in extending thy hand towards me: or the sin 
committed against me in slaying me, and thy 
sin for which thine offering was not accepted: 
and each noun is in the place of a denotative of 
state; i. e., [it means] that thou return involved 
in the two sins; bearing them: and perhaps the 
speaker may have meant, if that must inevitably 
take place, I desire that it may be thine act, 
not mine; so that the real meaning is, that it 
should not be his, not that it should be his 
brother's: or by the fj) may be meant the 
punishment thereof; for the desire of the 
punishment of the disobedient is allowable: (Bd:) 
accord, to Th, the meaning is, if thou have 
determined upon slaying me, the sin will be in 
thee, not in me. (M.) jc. I j jUa [in the 

Kur ii. 84] is explained by Aboo-Is-hak as 
meaning So they bore the burden of anger upon 
anger; syn. I jL4kl; this being said by him to be the 
proper signification of the verb: or, as some say, 
the meaning is, [they bore the burden of] sin for 
which they deserved the fire [of Hell] following 
upon sin for which they deserved the same: 
or they returned [laden with anger upon anger]: 
(T:) or they became deserving of anger upon 
anger. (Ksh.) [See a similar phrase, also from the 
Kur, above.] It is said in a form of prayer, ■PPj » jw' 
meaning I acknowledge, or confess, to 
Thee thy favour [towards me, as imposing an 
obligation upon me]. (Mgh.) You say also, <^ it); 
(S;) and <?4; (M, K;) He acknowledged, or 
confessed, [himself to be 

answerable, responsible, or accountable, for] his 
right, due, or just claim; (S;) and so [for] his 
blood: (M, K:) the verb expresses 


acknowledgment, or confession, always of 
something for which its agent is, as it 
were, indebted, or answerable; not the contrary. 
(S.) — — *4, in a poem of Sakhr-el-Ghei, 

means It [referring to a sword] became in 
my hand; my hand became to it a i. e. lSj'-* 
[or place of abode]; it returned, and became in 
my hand: or, accord, to Ibn- Habeeb, i. 
q. C&L! [app. a mistranscription for it rested, 
or remained; the verb «4 in this phrase being 
from f j) signifying f j jl, explained above]. (Skr p. 
16.) — *4 also signifies It (a thing, TA) suited, 
matched, tallied, corresponded, or agreed. (K.) 
[Hence,] 0^4 «4 (inf. n. 44, TA) Such a one 

was the like, or equal, of such a one, to be 
slain [in retaliation] for him: (T:) or became his 
like, or equal, so that he was slain [in retaliation] 
for him: (Mgh:) and was slain for him, (AZ, T, S,) 
and his blood became a compensation for the 
blood of the other: (T:) or was deserving of being, 
or fit to be, slain in retaliation for him, (Ksh and 
Bd in ii. 58,) because his equal: (Ksh ibid.:) or 
was slain for him, and so became equal with him; 
(K, * TA;) as also J, »*4i and | »fj4. (M, K.) One 
says, <0 j, i. e. Be thou of such as are slain [in 
retaliation] for him. (S.) And it is said in a 
prov., JkSj j' jp - 'Arari became slain for Kahl: 

these were two cows, which smote each other

say, the verb in this case is an imitative sequent 
to that preceding it: (A'Obeyd, S K: *) but this is 
naught: (K:) A'Obeyd says that in his opinion it is 
not an imitative sequent, because an imitative 
sequent is scarcely ever coupled with what

more commonly obtains, the action is restricted

in sleep: (M:) you say, 4 J4 4, meaning He 
did such a thing by night, or at night: (S, Msb, K:) 
[or he was in the night, or at night, or during the 
night, doing such a thing: and he passed, or 
spent, the night, or a night, or a part thereof, or, 
as will be seen below, he entered upon the night, 
doing such a thing:] like as one says, '4 J4 4= as 
meaning “ he did such a thing by day,” or “

Sarakustee and IKtt say that it has this meaning,

(K,) which is said to mean, “and the action is 
not one of sleep; ” so that when one sleeps by 
night, or at night, it is not correct to say, cjU : 
or, accord, to some, “its meaning is not that of 
sleeping; ” so that one may say, 4 j ci >U [Zeyd 
was in the night, &c., or passed, or spent, the 
night, &c., sleeping]: (MF:) [Fei says,] it is only 
when one remains awake in the night: and hence 
the saying in the Kur [xxv. 65], 0^3 

liliy 1314 [And those who pass the night 
prostrating themselves to their Lord and 
standing up in prayer]: (Msb:) Fr says that cjU 
144 means The man remained awake all 
the night, engaged in acts of obedience or of 
disobedience: (T, Msb:) [or it means the man 
entered upon the night; or he was in the night, or 
at night, or during the night, in any state, or 
engaged in any action; for] Zj says, (M,) cjU is 
said of any one whom the night has overtaken, 
(M, K, *) whether he have slept or not slept: (M:) 
and Lth says, signifies the entering upon 

the night: one says, '4 3 liS du [1 entered 
upon the night doing such and such things]: and 
he adds, (T,) he who says cjU as meaning he slept 
commits an error; for you say, ^ 'J clu [I 

entered upon, or passed, the night] looking at the 
stars: and how can he be sleeping who is looking 
at them? (T, Msb:) but Mulla 'Abd-El-Hakeem, in 
his Commentaries on the Mutowwal, says 
that ciU sometimes means he remained, 
continued, stayed, or dwelt, and he alighted 
and abode, by night, or at night, whether he slept 
or not: (MF:) and Ibn-Keysan says that it maybe 
used in the same manner as 4 [he slept]; and 
also, [as will be explained below,] in the same 
manner as (TA.) You say, <=X-= Zi jj! CjU (t) 
or (A) [He passed, or entered upon, the 
night, or a night, in a good manner]. And dij 
and Mr. and ci^ [I passed, or entered 

upon, the night, or a night, with, or at the abode 
of, the people, or company of men: the last of 
these phrases is the most common]. (A 'Obeyd, 
M, K.) — — Secondly, it is used in the sense 
of jl-= [He became]; (Msb;) or in the same 
manner as [he was]. (Ibn-Keysan, TA.) One 
says, cjU He became [or was] in such 

a place; whether in night-time or in day-time. 
(Msb.) And hence the saying of the lawyers, cjU 
<4 <4 141 iuc. He became [or was] with his wife 
one night; [which is the same as he passed a 
night &c.; though this, it will be observed, is not 
in this instance the signification of the 

verb alone;] whether sleeping or not. (Msb.) 

[Thus it is used both as a “ complete,” i. e. an 
attributive, verb, and also as an “ incomplete,” i. 
e. a non-attributive, verb.] cjU ; aor. CI14, (T, 


A,) inf. n. cjjj, (T, M, K,) also signifies (tropical:) 
He married, or took a wife: (T, A:) [see ciii 
below:] or (assumed tropical:) he gave in 
marriage; syn. of the inf. n. j. (Kr, M, K.) 
2 cimll ciuj He constructed, or built, the ell [i. e. 
tent, or house, &c.]. (M.) — ci, [inf. n. as

by night, or at night: (M:) and he thought, or 
meditated, upon it, considering its end, or issue, 
or result, (Zj, T, S, M, A, Msb, K,) or entered into 
it, (Zj, T,) by night, or at night. (Zj, T, S, M, &c.) 
And one says, 44 ciuj, (T, A,) meaning the same 
as J-4 l»i [It was thought, or meditated, upon, 
&c., by night, or at night]: (T:) [for] ciuj 

also signifies [simply] the thing was thought 
upon, and considered as to its end, issue, or 
result; syn. 1A (S.) Accord, to El-Marzookee, 
they say of a thing that is not done deliberately, 
and with good consideration of its issue or 
result, 44 jia jii 13*; [in the text from which this 
is taken, without the syll. signs;] and hence the 
saying in the Kur [iv. 83], i_s31l 44 <4U= cjl

doing otherwise than that which thou sayest; as is 
indicated in the M, where this is cited; and in like

passage of the Kur, is explained in the T as

upon in the night in order that one may apply 
himself to it with strong purpose, and not be

roots of the 34, a plant called 4, which is 
poisonous, killing beasts that eat of it: the verse is 
explained as above by El-Mohellebee: (IB:) or, as

egg of the ostrich from which the young bird has 


come forth, and which the male ostrich has cast 
away, so that men and camels tread upon it: 
(IAar, M:) or he is alone, without any to aid him; 
like the egg from which the male ostrich has 
arisen, and which he has abandoned as useless: 
(TA:) or he is an obscure man, or one of 
no reputation, whose lineage is unknown. (Ham 
p. 250.) And when said in praise, it means 
(tropical:) He is like the ostrich's egg in which 
is the young bird; because the male ostrich in 
that case protects it: (IAar, M:) or he is 
unequalled in nobility; like the egg that is 
left alone: (M:) or he is a lord, or chief: (IAar, M:) 
or he is the unequalled of the 4 [or country or

this sense, also, n. un. of J, 44. (S, K: [in the CK,

authority the saying of the rajiz, Pji J 3jj4 
i_k4J P 44 a* ^4441 [a damsel in her 
ample shift, whiter than the sister of the tribe of 
Benoo-Ibad]: Mbr, however, says that an 

anomalous verse is no evidence against a rule 
commonly approved: and as to the saying of 
another, 4jls 2413 IjlS JLkjll lit 

£ 4 = [when men experience dearth in winter, and 
their eating becomes vehement, thou art the 
whitest of them, or rather the white of them, in 
respect of cook's clothing, having little or nothing

question may be considered as an epithet of the 
measure that is followed by o? to denote 
excess: but it is only like the instances in the 
sayings li4-3 j 4 and 

meaning 44 j and 4 pkp; so it is as 

though he said '-4 p ‘pPP 4jli ; and as he has 
prefixed it to a complement which it governs in 
the gen. case, what follows is in the accus. case as 
a specificative. (S.) This latter verse is by 
Tarafeh, who satirizes therein 'Amr Ibn-Hind; 
and is also differently related in respect of the 
first hemistich, and the first word of the second. 

(L, TA.) J44 i 4=4: see 3 ; and see 3-4), near 

the end of the paragraph. PP is also used

will not separate itself from thy person. (As, A,

begetting an egg or eggs,] in like manner as one 
uses the word 4). (m, TA.) >3=4 A bleacher of

because the letter of declinability cannot have » 
subjoined to it; wherefore the letter 
of declinability is the first u-=, and the second is 
the augmentative, and for this reason it has 
subjoined to it the » whereof the purpose is 
to render plainly perceivable the vowel [which is 
necessarily added after the doubled >3=]: Aboo- 
'Alee says, [app. of the »,] that it should properly 
have neither fet-h nor any vowel. (M.) — — 
Applied to a man &c., it was sometimes used to 
signify White in complexion: but in this sense 
they generally used the epithet >41. (iAth, TA in 
art. >=.) They also said, 4jll 4=4 4^ and 32Ms 
4.jll =144, meaning Such a man, and such a 
woman, is clear, in face, from freckles or the like, 
and unseemly blackness. (Az, TA.) And they 
used 0 4===, (S, K,) a pi. of >341 , (TA,) in the contr. 
of the sense of 44, (S, K,) [i. e. as 
signifying Whites,] applied to men: (S:) though 
they applied the appellation =4411 j)l to the 
Abyssinian: (TA in art. jj&:) or to the negro: 
and u)4l 4 to the white man. (ISk.) But accord, 
to Th, >341 applied to a man signifies only 
(tropical:) Pure; free from faults: (IAth, TA in 
art. >=•:) or, so applied, unsullied in honour, 
nobility, or estimation; (Az, K;) free from faults; 
and generous: and so =44 applied to a 
woman. (Az.) [In the lexicons, however, (see, for 
ex., among countless other instances, an 
explanation of 324 in the S,) and in other post- 
classical works, it is generally used, when thus 
applied, in its proper sense, of White; or fair in 
complexion.] — — =44 421 An army, or a

author of the K has himself explained )Y 1

taken unawares; from g43 signifying “ he

significacations: He sold it: and he bought it: (S, 
Mgh, Msb, K:) and ) is a dial. var. of the 
same: (IKtt, Msb:) [but app. only in the former 
sense:] or this last signifies he offered it for sale; 
or exposed it to sale: (S, K:) and J, <431, as well 
as <411, signifies he bought it. (S, * Mgh, * Msb, 
K.) The primary signification of <33 is The 
exchanging, or exchange, of property; or the 
making an exchange with property; as in the 
phrases gl j [an exchange of property bringing 
gain], and gJ4 <33 [an exchange of 
property occasioning loss]: and this is a proper 
signification when it relates to real substances: 
but it is tropically used to signify the making 
the contract [of sale and purchase]; because this 
is the means of giving [and obtaining] 
possession: [though this signification is what is 
termed <4 jo <144., i, e., a sense so common as to 
be conventionally regarded as proper:] the 
phrase j3H j34, or and the like, mean <4~=> 
[i. e. The contract of sale, or purchase, was 
valid, or was null;] but the prefixed n. being 
suppressed, and its complement [alone] used 
for it, and this being masc., the verb is made 
masc. (Msb.) ^4 [mostly signifies He sold; and] is 
doubly trans., both by itself and by means of of 


prefixed to the second object; (Mgh, Msb;) this 
prep, being thus used as a corroborative: (Msb:) 
you say, <3-41 <°4 and <u <^4 [He sold to him the 
thing and He sold it to him]: (Mgh:) and '4j 4 *j 
and 4 j of CA *i [I sold to Zeyd the house: 
(see also an explanation of the phrase <14441 
<3-4: and see glLlUl of <44: to which might be 
added countless similar instances; for when £4 
signifies he sold, of is generally prefixed to the 
noun or pronoun denoting the person to 
whom the thing is sold:)] and sometimes J is put 
in the place of of, so that you say, <3-4 
and 411 <l4j [1 sold to thee the thing and I sold it to 
thee]; the J being redundant [when the verb has 
this meaning, though not when it has the contr. 
meaning, as will be seen below]. (Msb.) Of the 
contr. signification we have an ex. in the saying of 
ElFarezdak, <433 g-3 4231 j 444 g* gljl 4431 g| 
j44 [Verily youthfulness, he who buys it is a 
gainer; but hoariness, there are no traffickers for

the former sense]: (S, TA:) and [often in a case in 
which the verb is followed by J; as] in <3-4 <4 £-4 
He bought for him the thing; (Mgh;) [the J not 
being redundant when the verb is used in this 
sense;] and as in the saying of Tarafeh, 4L±g

and [in like manner] you say, 3I4I J, 4j, 
meaning Zeyd bought the house: and j. ?3W 
He bought it for another person. (Msb.) The verb 
has this signification, also, in the trad., j4 V 
J4 fy.Ug [One of you shall not buy in 
opposition to the buying of his brother when an 
agreement has been manifested but the contract 
has not been concluded]; (S, IAth, Mgh,

relation of Bkh, ^43 Y J, <4.1 J4 J33 1 : (Mgh,

termed fL«ut;] and some say £ Ji; (S, K;) changing 
the lS into j: and thus in the cases of Jk and Jk

medial radical is lS, and kesr or in the 
passive of a verb of which the medial radical 
is j, to prevent the mistaking of an active verb for 
a passive in such cases as and Cuwr others,

absolutely requires in these cases. (See I'Ak p.

superior power or force, when he has succeeded 
in doing as above explained; and similar to it is

Msb indicates that this latter is the 
primary signification accord, to the author of that 

work.] It is also from and so is [ jkkll; 

(S, TA: *) -LijLAkh and J, jkklt from signifying 
The making a covenant, a compact, an

gave him his own special property, and his 
obedience, and all that pertained to his case. 
(TA.) [Hence,] 2k He promised, or swore, 
allegiance to the prince; making a covenant with

not to dispute with him in respect of anything

he might impose upon him, pleasing 
and displeasing: in doing which, it was usual for 
the person making this covenant to place his 
hand in the hand of the prince, in confirmation

Dakhool &c., and] is similar to the saying, 3-ill

mentioned above]. (Msb.) [You say also, oS 
and oS &c., meaning In the midst 

of them. (See art. js-A) And Ai OH, and Oh, 
meaning Before him, and before them. Oh is also 
often used absolutely as a noun: thus it is in the

forth from between, or amidst, the spine and the

(lit. between their hands) a barrier.] It is said in 
the Kur [vi. 94 ], AAh j*l, as some read; 

or AAh, as others: (T, S, M:) the former means 
Verily your union hath become dissevered: (AA, 
T, S, M:) the latter, that which was between you; 
(fiA A, Ibn-Mes’ood, T, S, or fSi JS ^ill^ lAar, 
T;) or the state wherein ye were, in respect 
of partnership among you: (Zj, T:) or the state of 
circumstances, or the bond, or the love, or 
affection, [formerly subsisting] among you, 
or between you; or, accord, to Akh, piu, though 
in the accus. case as to the letter, is in the nom. 
case as to the place, by reason of the verb, and 
the adverbial termination is retained only 
because the word is commonly used as an adv. n.: 
(M:) AHat disapproved of the latter reading; but 


I _! 

wrongly, because what is suppressed accord, to 
this reading is implied by what precedes in the 
same verse. (T.) — — [It is often used as a 
partitive, or distributive; as also Oh A : for ex.,] 
you say, ‘A-A. Oh A, (S and TA in art. ( -»:u i ) 
or j fiJlA Oh A f*, (TA in art. ^-“=s) i. e. [They 
are partly, or in part,] beating with the staff, or 
stick, and [partly, or in part,] pelting with stones; 
[or some beating & c., and the others pelting &c.] 
(S and TA, both in art. 1 — and the latter in 
art. ^-s-^.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited 

voce <AA.] Oh Oh ^ means This (namely, a 

thing, S, or a commodity, Msb) is between good 
and bad: (S, Msb, K:) or of a middling, or middle, 
sort: (M:) these two words being two nouns made 
one, and indecl., with fet-h for their terminations, 
(S, Msb, K,) like j AA AoA. (Msb.) AaLill s JAp [i. 
e. the hemzeh uttered lightly] is called Oh ‘ j A

hemzeh and the soft letter whence is its vowel; (S, 
M;) or 3 m Oh ‘J**, the first Oh with kesreh but 
without tenween, and the second with tenween, 
(Sharh Shudhoor edh-Dhahab,) [i. e. the hemzeh 
&c.:] if it is with fet-h, it is between the hemzeh 
and the alif, as in JA ; (S, M,) for JAj; (M;) if with 
kesr, it is between the hemzeh and the ye, as 
in ?A, (S, M,) for A-; (M;) and if with damm, it is 
between the hemzeh and the waw, as in fjl, (S, 
M,) for (M:) it is never at the beginning of a 
word, because of its nearness, by reason of 
feebleness, to the letter that is quiescent, (S, M,) 
though, notwithstanding this, it is really 
movent: (S:) it is thus called because it is weak, 
(Sb, S, M,) not having the power of the hemzeh 
uttered with its proper sound, nor the clearness 
of the letter whence is its vowel. (M.) 'Obeyd Ibn- 
El-Abras says, Ah Oh ±*4 f jail J* jlj i. 

e. [Thou defendest what we ought to defend, or 
our banner, or standard, while some of the 
people, or company of men,] fall, one after 
another, in a state of weakness, not regarded as 
of any account: (S:) or it is as though he said, 
between these and these; like a man who enters 
between two parties in some affair, and falls, or 
slips, or commits a mistake, and is not 
honourably mentioned in relation to it: so says 
Seer: (IB, TA:) or between entering into fight and 
holding back from it; as when one says, Such a 
one puts forward a foot, and puts back another. 

(TA.) J, Ah and [ Aili are of the number of 

inceptive —a jj =>■: (M, K:) this is clear if by A jj =>• 
is meant "words:" that they have become 
particles, no one says: they are still adv. ns.: (MF, 
TA:) the former is Oh with its [final] fet- 
hah rendered full in sound; and hence the t; 


(Mughnee in the section next after that of I j, and 
K;) [i. e.,] it is of the measure 

[or Ai] from Ojh^, the [final] fet-hah being 
rendered full in sound, and so becoming '; and 
the latter is 0 h with A [restrictive of 
its government] added to it; and both have the 
same meaning [of While, or whilst]: (S:) or the I 
in the former is the restrictive '; or, as some say, 
it is a portion of the restrictive A [in the latter]: 
(Mughnee ubi supra:) and these do not 
exclude Oh from the category of nouns, but only 
cut it off from being prefixed to another noun: 
(MF, TA:) they are substitutes for that to 
which Oh would otherwise be prefixed: 
(Mgh:) some say that these two words are adv. 
ns. of time, denoting a thing's happening 
suddenly, or unexpectedly; and they are prefixed 
to a proposition consisting of a verb and an 
agent, or an inchoative and enunciative; so that 
they require a complement to complete the 
meaning. (TA.) One says, IP AA jj OlliS Li 
[While we were in such a state as that, lo, or 
there, or then, such a thing happened, or came to 
pass]: (M, Mgh, * K: *) and lP lA AP [while we 
were thus]: (Mgh:) and A I A A OpA At [While we 
were looking, or waiting, for him, he came to us]; 
(S, M;) a saying of a poet, cited by Sb; (M;) the 
phrase being elliptical; (S, M;) meaning A^a ji Oh 
A a jj Lpri, (m,) i. e., Ala j LLlaji jjj [between the 

times of our looking, or waiting, for him]. (S, M.) 
As used to put nouns following Al fo the gen. case 
when uS might properly supply its place; as in 
the saying (of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, which he thus 
recited, with kesr, S), Wji <6 j j j SUS1I 4ii*j liil 

lisjl* <1 [Amid his embracing the courageous 
armed men, and his guileful eluding, one day a 
bold, daring man was appointed for him, to slay 
him]: (S, K:) in [some copies of] the K, but 
in the Deewan [of the Hudhalees], -A*j : [fo the 
Mughnee, ubi supra, <IiUj : ] the meaning is uS 
A>Uj; the I being added to give fulness to the 
sound of the [final] vowel: (TA:) As used to say 
that the I is here redundant: (Skr, TA:) others put 
the nouns following both Aw and Ail fo the 
nom. case, as the inchoative and enunciative. 
(Skr, S, K.) Mbr says that when the noun 
following Ah is a real subst., it is put in the nom. 
case as an inchoative; but when it is an inf. n., or 
a noun of the inf. kind, it is put in the gen., 
and Ah in this instance has the meaning 
of Oh: and Ahmad Ibn-Yahya says the like, but 
some persons of chaste speech treat the latter 
kind of noun like the former: after 
however, each kind of noun must be in the nom. 
case. (AA, T.) [See an ex. in a verse cited towards

this is of two kinds: one is [a 

circumstantial indication or evidence; or] a thing 
indicating, or giving evidence of, a circumstance,

evidence, either spoken or written: [see also 3®:] 
it is also applied to language that discovers and 
shows the meaning that is intended: and an 
explanation of confused and vague language: (Er- 
Raghib, TA:) or the eduction of a thing from a 
state of dubiousness to a state of clearness: or 
making the meaning apparent to the mind so that 
it becomes distinct from other meanings and 
from what might be confounded with it. (TA.) — 
— Also Perspicuity, clearness, distinctness,

(T, S:) or simply perspicuity thereof: (Har p.

chaste, or eloquent, speech, declaring, or telling

showing of the intent, or meaning, with the most 
eloquent expression: it is an effect of 

understanding, and of sharpness, or quickness, of 
mind, with perspicuity, or chasteness, or 
eloquence, of speech: (Nh, TA:) or a faculty, or 
principles, [or a science,] whereby one knows 
how to express [with perspicuity of diction] one

Arabs restrict the science of o'®" to what

former: (TA:) or the former is the act of the

expression, and the latter concerns the 
meaning. (Kull.) It is said in a trad., o'®" a? a!

The third letter of the alphabet: called and 
[respecting which latter see the letter m]: the pi. 
[of the former is and of the latter,] £i Ji. (TA 
in <Jll lJJVI m 4.) It is one of the letters 
termed [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced 

with the breath only, without the voice], and of 
those termed 4*4 [and 4*4 and 44= j 
and 4*4 pronounced by pressing the tip of the 
tongue against the upper gums and suddenly 
withdrawing it with an emission of the breath]: 
these latter are -1= and -a and J three letters that 
are among those which are changed into other 
letters. (TA at the commencement of 411 y-4.) — 
It is one of the augmentative letters: (S:) and is 
movent when added at the beginning of a noun, 
and at the end of a noun, [and at the beginning 
of a verb,] and at the end of a verb, and is also 
quiescent at the end of a verb. (Mughnee, K.) — 
Added at the beginning of a noun, it is 
a preposition, or particle governing the gen. case, 
significant of swearing, (S, * Mughnee, K,) and 
denoting wonder; (Mughnee, K;) and [accord, to 
general usage] it is peculiarly prefixed to the 
name ■dll; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in ^ 4 4l'i [By 

God, verily it was thus, or verily such a thing 
was]; (S;) and 4 411) [By God, I 

will assuredly do such a thing]: (TA:) but 
sometimes they said, J [By my Lord], and m J 
4411 [By the Lord of the Kaabeh], and J-4JD 
[By the Compassionate], (Mughnee, K,) as is 
related on the authority of Akh; deviating from 
common usage. (TA.) Thus used, it is a substitute 
for j, (S, Mughnee,) as it is also in l s'jP and 41 J 
and »4i and 44 [&c.]; (S;) and the j is a 
substitute for m; (S, Mughnee;) but the 4 has 
the additional meaning of denoting wonder: so 
says Z. (Mughnee.) — Added at the end of a noun, 
it is a particle of allocution: (Mughnee, K:) it is 
thus added in 4ji [Thou], (S, Mughnee, K,) 
addressed to a male, (TA,) and 4ji [Thou], 
(Mughnee, K,) addressed to a female; (TA;) 
uniting with the noun, as though the two became 
one; not being an affixed noun governed in the 
gen. case. (S. [See ul]) — It is added in 
[the beginning of] the second person of the 
future, (S,) [i. e.,] in the beginning of the aor., 
(TA,) [as a particle of allocution,] as in 4jl 


[Thou dost, or wilt do]. (S, TA.) It is also 

added, as a sign of the fem. gender, in the 
beginning of the future, [or aor.,] as in 

[She does, or will do]. (S, TA.) It is also 

added in the beginning of the third person [fem.] 
of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a sign of 
the fem. gender,] as in -4, [Let Hind stand]. 
(TA.) — — And sometimes it is added in the 
beginning of the second person of the [aor. used 
as an] imperative, [as a particle of allocution,] as 
in the phrase in the Kur [x. 59, accord, to 
one reading], I ^ J4 ill Li [Therefore therein 
rejoice ye]: and in the saying of the rajiz, J[a 04> 
Ujh 4J 4J1 cjfi LajU-j U JA. [explained in 
art. JI]: and [thus] it is added in the beginning of 
[the second person of] the [aor. used as an] 
imperative of a verb of which the agent is not 
named, as in 1) » Jl [Be thou proud, 

vain, boastful, or self-conceited, O man], 
from J j: but Akh says that the adding of the J 
in the beginning of the second person of the [aor. 
used as an] imperative [except in the case of a 
pass, verb or a verb of which the agent is not 
named] is a bad idiom, because the J is not 
needed. (S, TA.) — The movent 4 added at the 
end of a verb is a pronoun, as in 4ia [I stood], 
(Mughnee, K,) and 4is [Thou stoodest, 
addressed to a male], and 44 [Thou stoodest, 
addressed to a female]: (Mughnee:) thus added 
in the first and second persons of the pret., it is a 
pronoun denoting the agent. (S.) — — The 
quiescent 4 added at the end of a verb is a sign of 
the fem. gender, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., a 
particle applied to denote the fem. gender, 
(Mughnee,) as in 44 [She stood]. (Mughnee, K.) 
J says [in the S] that, when thus added at the end 
of the pret., it is a pronoun: but IB says 
[correctly] that it is a particle. (TA.) — It is also, 
sometimes, affixed to p and 4 j; and in 
these cases it is most commonly movent with fet- 
h, (Mughnee, K,) so that one says 44) and 4ilj. 
(TA.) [See arts. P and yj.] - 4 is an 

imperative of Ji. (M in art. JI.) — [As a 
numeral, 4 denotes Four hundred.] I) 1 j fem. of I j; 
(M;) i. q. 4 [This and that]; (T;) a noun 
of indication, denoting that which is female or 
feminine; like (S, K) applied to that which is 


male or masculine; (S;) and you say 
also 4, like (S, K:) the dual is iP: and the 
pi., jt. (S, K.) En-Nabighah [Edh-Dhubyanee] 
says, (T, S,) excusing himself to En-Noaman

mistake: (A'Obeyd, T:) and it is said to mean 3!

(M.) And J Jll <1 is a phrase used as meaning

of serpents, (Lth, T,) or like the greatest thereof: 
(M:) it is related that a company of soldiers, on 
the shore of the Sea of Syria, saw a cloud divide 
upon the sea, and then rise, and they saw the tail 
of the u3 in a state of commotion in the fringe of 
the cloud: it is also related that a cloud carries 
the u3 to the country of Yajooj and Majooj [or 
Gog and Magog], and casts it down there, and 
they assemble thereupon, and eat its flesh: (T:)

phenomenon called a water-spout, to which this 
name is applied by the Arabs in the present day:

dragon: and a great sea-monster;] an 

aquatic animal, great in make, terrible in 
appearance, long and broad in the body, large in 
the head, having very glistening eyes, wide mouth 
and inside, and many teeth: it swallows many 
animals; the animals of the land and of the sea 
fear it; and when it moves, the sea becomes 
agitated with waves by reason of its great 
strength: in its first state, it is a malignant 
serpent, that eats what it sees of the beasts of the 
land; and when its mischief becomes great, God 
sends an angel that carries it away, and throws it 
to Yajooj and Majooj: it is related of one that 
was seen to fall, that it was found to be about two

companies, has no sing.; but, as some say, its

company: (Ham p. 796:) [it is also said that] A" is 
a pi. of A as meaning a company; (L in art. m y,

for 3 JUJI ,j21l, [the high, or exalted, companies,] 
the former word being made masc. because it is 
like pj [which is sing, and masc.]; but some say 
that this word here means the assemblies of the

meaning “ a company,” but not as relating to 
a wateringtrough or tank, is ls; and ISd holds it to 
be ls: and [if so,] its dim. is 1 AA (TA:) [but ISd

the medial radical, which is suppressed; for it is

may be from AA “ I collected: ” but Aboo-Is-hak 
makes it to be from AU1I AA aor. A; and this he

Hence the saying, lS j_>*i ^“3 (assumed tropical:)

right. (T.) He spread (J-«j for it, namely, a

that the sun might not strike it, and its milk 
become consequently decomposed, or curdled.

inf. n. as above, (TA,) He wiped his hand (S, M,

ground. (S, M.) p There; syn. (Zj, S, M, K;) a 
noun of indication, (Zj, T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) 
denoting a place that is remote (Zj, T, S, M, 
Mughnee, K) from the speaker, (Zj, T, M,) like 
as tli denotes that which is near; (Zj, T, S;) or 
denoting a place other than that of the speaker: 
(Msb:) it is an adverbial noun, not to be used 
otherwise than as such; (Mughnee, K;) indecl. 
because of its vagueness, and with fet-h for 
its termination to avoid the concurrence of two 
quiescent letters. (Zj, T, M.) Thus in the saying 
[in the Kur xxvi. 64], ao^-VI P jl j [And 

we brought near, there, the others]. (Mughnee.) 
He who makes it decl. as an objective 
complement (Mughnee, K) in this ex., 
(Mughnee,) and in the saying in the Kur [lxxvi. 
20], ciyi j p Cyij I jt j, is in error: (Mughnee, 

K: *) Zj says that the meaning is, And when thou 
castest thine eyes, or thy sight, there, thou shalt 
behold [scenes of] enjoyment: that Fr asserted 
the meaning to be, p Cyi j tat [when thou seest 

what is there]; but that this is an error; for t-*, 
accord, to this interpretation, is a conjunct noun, 


o 

and it is not allowable to suppress a conjunct 

noun and leave its complement. (T.) p j? 

is used by postclassical writers as meaning 
Therefore; for that reason; on that account.] P, 
(T, S, M, &c.,) for which one also says p, (M, 
Mughnee,) substituting <-* for the H, (M,) and 
(T, S, M) and ciiil, (M, TA,) but cji5 is the more 
common, (Mughnee and K on the letter cj) 
and iiia and cjia, (M, TA,) [meaning Then, i. e., 
afterward, or afterwards,] a particle, (M, K,) or 
conjunction, (Zj, T, S, Msb, Mughnee,) 
denoting order (Zj, T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee) and a 
delay, (S, Msb,) or having three properties, 
namely, that of virtually associating in the same 
case [the latter of the two members which it 
conjoins with the former of them], and denoting 
order, and denoting a delay; but respecting all of 
these there is a difference of opinions. (Mughnee, 
K. *) As to the associating in the same case, Akh 
and the Koofees assert that it sometimes fails 
to have this property, by its occurring 
redundantly, so as not to be a conjunction at all; 
and they hold to accord with this assertion 
the saying in the Kur [ix. 119], f&P- claUi tat 

takta V (jl Ijilaj p . C-i jV. CllsU-aj Laj 

,_ii3 p VI <111 [Until, when the earth 
became strait to them, notwithstanding its 
amplitude, and their minds became straitened to 
them, and they knew that there was no repairing 
for refuge from God save unto Him, then He 
returned to forgiveness towards them]: 
(Mughnee, K: *) but this has been resolved by the 
subaudition of the complement [of what 
precedes P, as though the meaning were, then 
(they betook themselves unto Him, 
begging forgiveness, and) He returned &c.]. 
(Mughnee.) And as to its denoting order, some 
hold that there are exs. of its not necessarily 
implying this; (Mughnee, K; *) one of which is 
the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 8], o* 

44 jj p : (Mughnee: [in which are 

added other similar exs., one of which is given in 
the K:]) but to this there are five replies: 1st, that 
this passage is elliptical; the meaning being, He 
created you from one person (which He 
originated); then He made therefrom its mate: 
2nd, that the meaning is, He created you from 
a person that was alone; then & c.: 3rd, that the 
progeny of Adam were made to come forth from 
his back like little ants; then Eve was created 
from his [rib called the] 4 that the 

creation of Eve from Adam being unusual, p is 
used to notify its order and posteriority in respect 
of wonderfulness and of the manifestation of 
power; not to denote order and posteriority of 


time: 5th, that p is here used to denote the order 
of enunciation; not the virtual order: the 
replies preceding this last are better than it, 
inasmuch as they verify the order and the delay; 
whereas the last verifies the order only, as 
there is no delay between the two enunciations; 
but the last reply is of more common application, 
applying to the ex. given above and to 
others: (Mughnee:) Fr says that the meaning of 
the ex. given above is, He created you from a 
person (which He created) single; then &c.; and 
in like manner says Zj. (T.) And as to its denoting 
a delay, Fr asserts that sometimes this is not the 
case, as is shown by the saying, U 

li p [What thou didst to-day 
excited my wonder, or admiration, or pleasure; 
then (I tell thee) what thou didst yesterday was 
more wonderful, or admirable, or pleasing]; for p 
is here used to denote the order of the 
enunciation; not a delay between the 
two enunciations. (Mughnee, K. *) — — [It is 
said that] it denotes order and a delay when it 
conjoins single words: but Akh says that it has 
the meaning of j [And], because it is used in 
cases in which there is no order; as in <111 j p <® j 
[By God, and (I say again,) By God, I will 
assuredly do such a thing]: and when it conjoins 
propositions, it does not necessarily denote 
order, but has the meaning of j: (Msb:) it has the 
meaning of j, (S, Msb,) the conjunction, (S.) in 
the saying in the Kur [x. 47], Aill p 

0j 1*% [And God is witness of what they do]. (S, 

Msb.) The Koofees allow its being used in 

the manner of and j so as that the aor. 
immediately following it after a conditional verb 
may be man- soob: and Ibn-Malik allows its 
being thus used so as that the aor. immediately 
following it after the expression of a desire that 
the thing shall not be done may be marfooa and 
mejzoom and man- soob. (Mughnee.) P: see 
— In the saying £ j Pj P <1 t-i [He has not p 
nor ?Ji, the former of these two nouns 
signifies water-skins, or milk-skins, and vessels; 
(M;) or what is bad, or the worst, of those things, 
(S, K,) accord, to ISk; (S;) or men’s household- 
goods, or furniture and utensils, and their water- 
skins, or milk-skins, and vessels; (T, TA;) which 
last is the right meaning: (TA:) and the latter 
noun signifies cimll [app. meaning, accord, to 
analogy, (for I find no suitable explanation of it in 
any of the lexicons,) the means by which a house, 
or tent, is put into a good state; and therefore, 
good furniture and utensils]. (ISk, S, M, K.) You

With respect to this saying, Fr remarks, when L— 
occurs in the Kur, with — prefixed to the name of 
the thing sold or bought, in most cases it relates 
to two things whereof neither is a O" in the sense 
commonly known, i. e., such as pieces of gold and 
of silver: and such is the case when you 
say, j'—Sk 43- ciy jlil [1 purchased a garment with 
a q. v.]: either of these may be termed a O" 
for the other: but in speaking of pieces of silver 
and of gold, you prefix the m to the 0-" [only]; 
as is done in [the chapter of] Yoosuf, [i. e. ch. xii., 
v. 20, where it is said,] j- j^'3-^ i_>"4 0 s *- » 33" 3 
[And they sold him for a deficient, or an

so as to require their being weighed, but few, and 
therefore counted]: for pieces of silver are always 
a O": and when you purchase pieces of silver 
and of gold with the like, you prefix the m to 
whichever of the two you will, because each of 
them in this case is a purchase and a price.

above to g'-4]: (M, K:) or it is originally a rel. n. 
from 0-3', because it is the part, or portion, that 
makes seven to be eight, so that it is its eighth: 
they make the first letter to be pronounced with 
fet-h, because they make changes [in some other 
cases] in the rel. n., (S, K,) as when they say 34— 
and is j*4 [which are rel. ns. of 34- and 3*4] (S,) 
and they suppress one of the two is which are 
characteristic of the rel. n., and compensate it by 
the insertion of I, as they do in the rel. n. of 3*4' 
[when they say 3-4, originally 344;, for 344]: (S, 
K: [and the like is said in the Mgh:]) El-Farisee 
says that the ' of O'-" is the characteristic of the 
rel. n., because this word is not a broken 
pi. like 3-=—° ; and IF assents to this, and says that 
were it not so, the » would be inseparable, as it is 
in 4^4*- &c. (M.) You say 3'-4 j 43-" [Eight men],

when O'-" is prefixed to another noun, its is is 
retained, like the <_s in <^—=41': (S, Msb, K:) and it 
is decl. in the same manner as words of the class

The people of El-Hijaz pronounce the masc. and 
the fem. with nasb in every case, in phrases 
like and ofr"" 3 u""'; and so on to ten

made of eight fleeces. (T.) pP'j £i'p [She 
advances with four and goes back with eight] is a 
saying of one of the uj ""- 3 of El- 
Medeeneh; meaning, with four creases (u^) of 
the belly, and with eight extremities thereof; each 
crease having two extremities, towards the 
two sides of the woman spoken of. (Mgh in 
art. clui.) The saying o'-" P £p should 

properly be J, (S,) which means, The 

garment, or piece of cloth, is seven cubits in 
length by eight spans in breadth; (Msh;) because 
the length is measured by the j), which is fem., 
and the breadth hy the JP, which is masc.; hut 
they use the fem. when they do not mention 
things; as when they say, jjill a 3 tiLU [We 
fasted, of the month, five], though meaning days: 
(S:) or because P is fem. in most instances, 
and jP is masc. (Msb.) [But it is said that 
when V 1 -" means the things numbered, not the 
amount of the number, it is imperfectly deck, 
being regarded as a proper name: thus] you 
say, a? <*P [Nine things are more than 
eight things]. (TA voce q. v.) [See also ^.] 
— — When you make it a compound [with 
the number ten], you say, P& jjjUii [i

fet-h or make it quiescent, saying, a? sP- 
sljil i'jZi. pjH or [i have with me, of 

women, eighteen women]; but the former is the 
more chaste; and in one dial., the s is elided, on 
the condition of [saying » ipc o'-",] making the 0 
to be with fet-h; (Msh;) or in this case you 
say » jP O'-", with kesr. (T.) A poet says, (T, S,)

Uj ji j otH"' j ‘pi. [And I will assuredly drink eight 
cups of wine, (a pi. of uP, which is fem.,

either by suppressing the ', which is 
the preferable way, so that you say J, <PP, or hy 


suppressing the s, saying J, '<P, changing the '

when an exception is made from things 
sold without measuring or weighting or 
numbering: and in a contract with another for 
labour upon land on the condition of sharing the

after the half or the third. (IAth, TA.) The saying 
of Mo- hammad, *3 33s 3531 3 means 
Whoso maketh an exception, his shall be what he 
excepteth: (M, TA: *) as, for instance, when one 
says, “I divorce her thrice, save once: ” or “ 
I emancipate them, except such a one. ” (TA.) —

a slaughtered camel; (T, M, * K;) because the

for the final radical, lS, (M, TA,) as it is 
in I A*!, the only other instance of this 
substitution except in words of the measure 
(Sb, M, TA:) in Al, the final radical, lS 
is suppressed: (Msb:) it has no sing.: (Lth, T:) if it 
were allowable to assign to it a sing., it would 
be A [for the masc.] and A [for the fem.], 
like yj] and A!: (S:) accord, to some, (Msb,) it is 
originally A; (T, Msb, CK;) and hence the 
dual ylSj; (Msb:) or it is originally (A, (M, Msb, 
and so in a copy of the K,) the conjunctive I being 
then substituted for the lS whence the dual A'> 
like A l; (Msb:) this is shown by the form of its 
pi., which is Al, (m, K,) like (A [pi. of A, which 
is originally A or A,] and Ai [pi. of which 
is originally A]. (M.) In the saying in the Kur 
[xvi. 53], A 1 iAj I V [Take not to yourselves 
two gods], the last word is added as 
a corroborative. (M.) The phrase AA A occurs, 
by poetic license, for AA a? A“!, 
meaning yt lteA [Two colo- cynths]. (S.) You say 
also, Al AA _[ and li* (A 1 AA, 
meaning [I drank] twice as much as the bowl, 
and as this bowl: and in like manner, (A 1 A A 
?AA ii and »AA A A 1 [I drank twice the 
quantity of the of El-Basrah]. (M.) And a poet 
says, l 1 : '' * ^ Ujjs Vj j 4 jVS 1I V) i), % Ida

days of the week; [the second; namely, Monday;] 
because the first, with the Arabs, is (M;) as 
also | A' 1 , like JJ; (K;) so in the copies of the K; 
[or,] accord, to some, J, A^, [originally is A,] of 
the measure JA, like A [pi. of A], is used in 
this sense; (TA;) or J. A^ 1 fA, [so in the 
M, accord, to the TT,] mentioned by Sb, on the 
authority of certain of the Arabs: (M:) the pi. 
is Al and uA, (M, K,) the latter mentioned 
on the authority of Th: but it has no dual: and 
those who say Al form this pi. from A', 
although this has not been in use: (M:) or it 
has neither dual nor pi., (S, Msb,) being itself a 
dual; (S;) but if you would form a pi. from it, you 
would regard it as itself a sing., and make its 
pi. uA: (S, Msb:) IB says that uA has not been 
heard [from the Arabs], and is only mentioned by 


Fr, on the ground of analogy; that it is far-fetched 
in respect of analogy; and that the pi. heard 
is Al; Seer and others mention, as heard from 
the Arabs, AVI f AA A [Verily he fasts on the 
Mondays]. (TA.) uA in uA f jj has no dim. (Sb, 
S in art. i_A.) IJ says that the article J in uA 
is not redundant, though the word is not an 
epithet: Abu-l-'Abbas says that the prefixing of 
the article in this case is allowable because 
the virtual meaning is A^ 1 f A [the second day]. 
(M.) The saying A^ 1 fjjll means The name of to- 
day [is AA; and is like the saying y'-iji fA [to- 
day is two days] and jA 1 u* jA Adi yjA\ [to- 
day is fifteen of the month]. (Sb, M.) 
Sometimes, f j i, without the article J 1 , occurs 

in poetry. (M, K.) When a pronoun refers 
to A SVI [as meaning Monday], this word may be 
treated in two ways, [as a sing, and as a dual,] but 
the more chaste way is to treat it as a sing., 
as meaning the day: (Msb:) [thus,] Aboo-Ziyad 
used to say, A cfiP'' [Monday passed 
with what occurred in it]; making it sing, and 
masc.; and thus he did in the case of every day of 
the week, except that he made fem.: Abu-I- 
Jarrah used to say, A cAVI tA", treating 
the word as a numeral; and thus he treated the 
third and fourth and fifth days, saying in each of 

these cases A. (M.) [lA*- 1% fem. 

respectively, in a case of nasb and 
khafd, iA*- (A! and ‘ipi- and with I when 
not immediately preceded by a quiescence; mean 
Twelve: see ‘iAc,] y jjjl, [with I when not

on the second day of the week. (IAar, Th, M,

(TA.) (S, Mgh) and J, (T, S) [Two and two;

repeated in it; or because one peruses it

(A.) Sometimes, is used metonymically 

to signify (tropical:) A thing [of any kind] that 
veils, covers, or protects: as in the saying of a 
poet, (jAlCull .A 1 .! j q aii yJ 4 -j 

441 [Like the means of protection adopted by 
Ibn-Beed: he protected them by it, and closed the 
way against the passengers]. (TA.) Ibn-Beed was 
a wealthy merchant of the tribe of 'Ad, who 
hamstrung his she-camel upon a mountain-road, 
and stopped the way [to his abode] with it. (K in 

art. i_4«.) In the same manner, also, 445 is 

used to signify (tropical:) Weapons. (Ham p. 63.) 

And 44 is sometimes employed to signify 

(assumed tropical:) The wearers of garments; 
the wearers' bodies. (R, TA.) Esh-Shemmakh

mounted them, namely, the travellingcamels, (T,)

wearer's body, or self; or what the garments 
infold: and 445 is employed in the same manner. 
(TA.) You say, ILjl <11, i. e. (tropical:) To God be 
he [meaning his excellence] attributed! [for 
nothing but what is excellent is to be attributed to 
God:] (A:) or it means <11 [To God be

Withdraw, or separate, thyself from me. (A.) 

[The following exs. are mostly, or all, tropical.] — 
— 4? ^45 4 <4* 4 44 j], (K, * TA,) a 


saying of Mohammad, repeated by Aboo-Sa'eed 
El-Khudree, when, being about to die, he 
had called for new garments, and put them on: 
(TA:) it means Verily the dead will be raised in 
his garments in which he dies; accord, to some; 
and was used in this sense by Aboo-Sa'eed: 
(ElKhattabee, MF, TA:) or (assumed tropical:) 
[agreeably with] his works (K, TA) with which 
his life is closed: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:) in

4], means And purify thy garments: (Abu-1-

shortening them is a means of purify: (T:) or 
(assumed tropical:) put not on thy garments in a

T:) or (assumed tropical:) be not perfidious; for 
[figuratively speaking,] he who is so pollutes 
his garments: (Fr, T:) or, as some say, (assumed
