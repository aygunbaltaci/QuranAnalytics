PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

disliked that three months during which they

might not make predatory expeditions should 
come upon them consecutively, as their 
subsistence was obtained by such expeditions: so 
he made ElMoharram free from restriction to 
them. (S.) [But this, as appears from what is said 
in the Kur, ix. 37, was not done every year.] The 
tribes of Teiyi and Khath'am did not observe the 
sacred months; therefore the (or postponer) 
proclaimed it lawful to slay them therein, when 
they were aggressors. (TA.) — — [The 

term appears also to have been applied to 
The postponement of the time of the pilgrimage; 
which was another custom of the Pagan Arabs, 
mentioned under this word in the TA.] The 
Arabs, liking that the day of their return from 
pilgrimage should always be at one season of the 
year, postponed it every year eleven days; at the 
same time keeping sacred the two months in 
which the pilgrimage took place, and the month 
next after those two, and also the month of Rejeb, 
at whatever season this fell. (TA.) [For the same

in a state of commotion, previously to rising. 

(Lth, K, TA.) [See also ^’ -. Vi .] And He (a

(Az, S, M;) the utmost, or extreme, extent, term,

a trad., (S, M,) of 'Alee, (S,) 3^ i-LLillI li| 
Jji (S, * M, K, *) or 3^ 

jjliLJI, (k, * TA,) but the former is that which is

and know the real natures of things, (K, art. 3*-,) 
[then the male relations on the father's side have 
a better right to dispose of her in marriage than 
the mother;] meaning, when they attain to that 
age at which they are qualified to contend 
for their rights; [accord, to the former reading;] 
for this is what is termed (K, * TA:) or 

when they attain to puberty: (Az, TA:) or when 
they attain to that period at which they become 
objects of contention for right; when every one of 
the guardians asserts himself to have the best 
right: (K:) or 3^=31 in the trad, is a metaphorical 
term, from the same word as applied to camels 
[when entering upon the fourth year]; (K, * TA;) 


and Lsilisdl, also, in this case, accord, to 
some, properly signifies the same, being a pi.

they attain to the extreme term of childhood.

made apparent, his opinion. ” (TA.) Hence, also, 
as used by the practical lawyers, it 

signifies (tropical:) An evidence, or a proof:

the Sunneh, used as an authority in an argument, 
for proof of an assertion.] The pi. [in all these 

senses] is i^j^. (Msb.) [Also, (assumed

expressed, in the S;] syn. fjsj (K:) or, the 
former, as Az says, in one place, a kind of

vehement pace or going. (M.) See l.

when the soul was in the side of his mouth; but 
he escaped not save] with the scabbard of a 
sword and with a waist-wrapper. (S.) In the same 
sense the word is used in the saying. J 1 iA 

liSj I j£ [but this seems rather to mean, It is in 

the mind of such a one to do so and so]. (Aboo- 
Is-hak, M.) Some of the lexicologists assert 
the o-“ii and the £ j j to be one and the same, 
except that the former is fem., and the latter 
[generally or often] masc.: others say, that the 
latter is that whereby is life; and the former, that 
whereby is intellect, or reason; so that when one 
sleeps, God takes away his but not his c JJ, 
which is not taken save at death: and the is 
thus called because of its connexion with the 
[or breath]. (IAmb.) Or every man has [two 
souls]: (I’Ab, Zj:) J»*JI [the soul of intellect, or 

reason, also called (see A jj)], whereby 

one discriminates, [i. e., the mind,] (TAb,) or 

[the soul of discrimination], which quits 
him when he sleeps, so that he does not 
understand thereby, God taking it away: (Zj:) 
and j jjlt [the soul of the breath], whereby 

one lives, (TAb,) or [the soul of life], and 

when this quits him, the breath quits with 
it; whereas the sleeper breathes: and this is the 
difference between the taking away of the of 
the sleeper in sleep and the taking away 
of the of the living [at death.] (Zj.) Much has 
been said respecting the and the £ jj; 
whether they be one, or different: but the truth is, 
that there is a difference between them, since 
they are not always interchangeable: for it is said

in the Kur, [xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,] o* SP 

[And I have blown into him of my spirit.]; 
not es— and [v. 116,] ^ [to he 

explained hereafter]; not ^jj nor would this 
expression be well except from Jesus: and 
[lviii. 9,] Oj J jdj [And they say in their 

souls, or within themselves]: for which it would 
not be well to say jjl and [xxxix. 57,] J 
iS*d Jjd [That a soul shall say]; for which no 
Arab would say £jj <X>d u 1 : hence, the difference 
between them depends upon the considerations 
of relation: and this is indicated by a trad., 
in which it is said that God created Adam, and 
put into him a o-d and a £jj; and that from the 
latter was his quality of abstaining from unlawful 
and indecorous things, and his understanding, 
and his clemency, or forbearance, and his 
liberality, and his fidelity; and from the former, 
[which is also called (J-iill, q. v., in art. >•!,] 
his appetence, and his unsteadiness, and his 
hastiness of disposition, and his anger: therefore 
one should not say that <2>d is the same 
as c JJ absolutely, without restriction, nor £ jj 
the same as u-d. (R.) The Arabs also make the 
discriminative i_>d to be two; because it 
sometimes commands the man to do a thing or 
forbids him to do it; and this is on the occasion of 
setting about an affair that is disliked: therefore 
they make that which commands him to be a ud, 
and that which forbids him to be as though it 
were another i_yd: and hence the saying, 
mentioned by Z, dj*d jpjj cP* (tropical:) [Such a 
one consults his two souls, or minds]; said of a 
man when two opinions occur to him. (TA.) [ts-dj 
is an elliptical phrase sometimes used, 

for i which see in art. ls-^.] 

(assumed tropical:) A thing's self; (S, M, A, 
K, TA;) used as a corroborative; (S, TA;) its 
whole, (Aboo-Is-hak, M, TA,) and essential 
constituent: (Aboo-Is-hak, M, A, K, TA:) pi. as 
above, odl and o* jd. (M.) You say, kd U 5 la Cyl j 
(assumed tropical:) I saw such a one himself, (S,) 
and ■=— [or, more properly, <dj j* 

(see, under the head of h, a remark on that 
preposition when used in a case of this kind, 
redundantly,)] He came to me himself. (S, 
K.) And <dj jiYI (Jj [He superintended, 
managed, or conducted, the affair in his own 
person]. (K, in art. jP, & c.) And <*d dd [He 
talked to himself; soliloquized]. (Msb, in art. jh; 
&c.) And -dd (assumed tropical:) [Such a 

one killed himself]: and <d 

(assumed tropical:) made his whole self to fall 
into destruction. (Aboo-Is-hak, M.) And hence. 


(TA,) from 6d signifying (M,) the 

saying mentioned by Sb, Jdll dl jj (assumed 
tropical:) [I alighted in the mountain itself]: 
and jjtfi Jdll od (assumed tropical:) 
[The mountain itself is facing me]. (M, TA.) 
[Hence also the phrase] jiVI gd j j [meaning 
(assumed tropical:) in reality; in the thing itself]: 
as in the saying, gd J lAJa Cfe P u] j ^d ^ila 

(assumed tropical:) [He held it to be little in 
his mind though it was not little in reality]. (Msb, 
art. Ja.) The words of the Kur, [v. 116,] fd 
dd j U jlici Y j mean (assumed tropical:) 

Thou knowest what is in myself, or in my 
essence, and I know not what is in thyself, or in 
thine essence: (Bd, K:) or Thou knowest what I 
conceal (M, Bd, Jel) in my gd [or mind], (Bd, 
Jel,) and I know not what is in thyself, or in thine 
essence, nor that whereof Thou hast the 
knowledge, (M.) or what Thou concealest of the 
things which Thou knowest; (Bd, Jel;) so that the 
interpretation is, Thou knowest what I know, and 
I know not what Thou knowest: (M:) or gd is 
here syn. with dc.; and the meaning is, gd d Ad 
dAc. U jdoi 'ij; (k, * TA;) [i. e., Thou knowest 
what is in my particular place of being, and I 
know not what is in thy particular place of being; 
for] the adverbiality in this instance is that 
of not of Jd*: (TA:) but the best explanation 

is that of IAmb, who says that gd is here syn. 
with -d; so that the meaning is, Thou 
knowest (jd. [my hidden things, or what is 
hidden from me, and I know not thy hidden 
things, or what Thou hidest]; and the correctness 
of this is testified by the concluding words of the 
verse, sp jdl fd dl dit [for Thou art he who well 
knoweth the hidden things]: (TA:) [and here it 
must be remarked that] Mi*! 1 , which occurs 
afterwards in the K as one of the significations 
of gdll, is a mistake for the word used by 

IAmb in explaining the above verse. (TA.) 

(assumed tropical:) A person; a being; an 
individual; syn. gdd (Msb;) a man, (Sb, S, M, 
TA,) altogether, his soul and his body; (TA;) a 
living being, altogether. (Mgh, Msb.) In this 
sense of gdd; it is masc.: (Msb:) or, accord to Lh, 
the Arabs said, j d <— yl j (assumed tropical:) 
[I saw one person], making it fern.; and in like 
manner, gA j? gdd dlj (assumed tropical:) [I 
saw two persons]; but they said, 
gdl (assumed tropical:) [I saw three persons], 
and so all the succeeding numbers, making it 
masc.: but, he says, it is allowable to make it 
masc. in the sing, and dual., and fem. in the pi.: 
and all this, he says, is related on the authority of 


Ks: (M:) Sb says, (M.) they said gdl (S, M,) 
making it masc., (S,) because they mean by gd “ 
a man,” (S, M,) as is shown also by their 
saying -d} gd: (M:) but Yoo asserts of Ru-beh, 
that he said gdl d Ai, making gd fem., like as 
you say 1 jd dilj, meaning, of men; and 
gddi, meaning, of women: and it is said in 
the Kur, [iv. 1 , &c.,] ;dj gd g? gAl 

(assumed tropical:) [who created you from one 
man], meaning, Adam. (M.) You also say, dl j I* 
'—d p (assumed tropical:) I saw not there any 

one. (TA.) (assumed tropical:) A brother: 

(IKh, IB:) a copartner in religion 
and relationship: (Bd, xxiv. 61:) a copartner in 
faith and religion. (Ibn-'Arafeh.) (assumed 
tropical:) It is said in the Kur, [xxiv. 61,] fAli ' ip 
ALdl Jc. tjiLi Ujjj And when ye enter houses, 
salute ye your brethren: (IB:) or your copartners 
in religion and relationship. (Bd.) And in verse 12 
of the same chapter, A-dL means (assumed 
tropical:) Of their copartners in faith and 

religion. (Ibn-'Arafeh.) (tropical:) Blood: 

(S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) [or the life-blood: in 
this sense, fem.:] pi. [of pauc. gdi and of 
mult.] gjd: (IB:) so called [because the animal 
soul was believed by the Arabs, as it was by 
many others in ancient times, (see Gen. ix. 4, and 
Aristotle, De Anim. i. 2, and Virgil's /En. ix. 349.) 
to diffuse itself throughout the body by means of 
the arteries: or] because the gd [in its proper 
sense, i. e. the soul,] goes forth with it: (TA:) or 
because it sustains the whole animal. (Mgh, 
Msb.) You say, ; '-d dJU» (tropical:) [His blood 
flowed]. (S.) And dd gd (tropical:) [Flowing

(assumed tropical:) Voice, or a sweet voice, in

much as is swallowed at once in drinking: (S, L, 
K:) but this requires consideration; for in one c3 
a man takes a number of gulps, more or less 
according to the length or shortness of his breath, 
so that we [sometimes] see a man drink 
[the contents of] a large vessel in one i_3, at a

which is another star, or asterism, opposite to it, 
at the same time, in the east, each night for a 
period of thirteen days: thus does each star, or 
asterism, of those Mansions, [one after another,] 
to the end of the year, except the period of 
which is fourteen days: (S:) [or it signifies 
the auroral rising, and sometimes the auroral 
setting, of one of those stars, or asterisms; as will 
be shown below: I do not say “ heliacal ” rising 
because the rising here meant continues for a 
period of thirteen days]. Accord, to the T, « ji 
signifies the setting of one of the stars, or 
asterisms, above mentioned: and AHn says, that 
it signifies its first setting in the morning, when 
the stars are about to disappear; which is when 
the whiteness of dawn diffuses itself. (TA.) 
A'Obeyd says, I have not heard «■ y used in the 
sense of “ setting,” “ falling,” except in this 
instance. (S.) It is added, [whether on his or 
another's authority is doubtful,] that the [pagan] 
Arabs used to attribute the rains and winds and 
heat and cold to such of the stars, or asterisms, 
above mentioned as was setting at the time 
[aurorally]; or, accord, to As, to that which was 
rising in its ascendency [aurorally]; and used to 
say, ^ fjy [We have been given rain by 

such a « jj]; (S;) or they attributed heat [and cold] 
to the rising or the star or asterism, and rain [and 
wind], to its « jj [meaning its setting]. (AHn, Har, 
p. 216.) This the Muslim is forbidden to say, 
unless he mean thereby, “ We have been given 
rain at the period of such a ” God having 
made it usual for rain to come at [certain of] the 
periods called Again, A'Obeyd says, The y\ 
are twenty-eight stars, or asterisms; sing, c y: the 
rising of any one of them in the east [aurorally] is 
called « y; and the star, or asterism, itself is hence 
thus called: but sometimes « y signifies the 
setting. Also, in the L it is said, that each of 


the abovementioned stars, or asterisms, is called 
thus because, when that in the west sets, the 
opposite one rises; and this rising is 
called but some make to signify the 
setting; as if it bore contr. senses. (TA.) [El- 
Kazweenee mentions certain physical 
occurrences on the occasions of the »lj2l of the 
Mansions of the Moon; and in each of 
these cases, except three, the « ji is the rising, not 
the setting. Two of the excepted cases are 
doubtful: the passage relating to the third 
plainly expresses an event which happens at the 
period of the auroral setting of HyA\; namely the 
commencement of the days called f'J 
corresponding, accord, to ElMakreezee, 
with the rising of £ j»ll, the j of ^ yA\: 
and it is said in the S, art. 'yy-, on the authority of 
Ibn-Kunaseh, that the ^ fall at the period 

of the zy of yA I. (The auroral setting of yA), 
at the commencement of the era of the Flight, in 
central Arabia, happened about the 9th of March 
O. S.; and this is the day of the N. S., the 26th of 
February O. S., on which commence the ^ 
accord, to the modern Egyptian almanacs.) 
Hence it appears, that sometimes the setting, but 
generally the rising, was called the » j 3 . Moreover, 
the ancient Arabs had twenty-eight 
proverbial sayings (which are quoted in the Mir- 
at ez-Zeman, and in the work of El-Kazweenee) 
relating to the risings of the twenty-eight 
Mansions of the Moon: such as this: li] 

jlijll y'yA Jijlill “ when Esh-Sharatan rises, 
the season becomes temperate: ” or, perhaps, 

— the night and day, become equal. ” (If this 
latter meaning could be proved to be the right 
one, we might infer that the Calendar of the 
Mansions of the Moon was in use more than 
twelve centuries B. c.; and that for 
this reason 0^ was called the first of the 
mansions; though it may have been first so called 
at a later period as being the first Mansion in 
the first Sign of the Zodiac. But I return to the 
more immediate object which I had in view in 
mentioning the foregoing sayings.) I do not 
find any of these sayings (though others, I 
believe, do) relating to the settings. Hence, again, 
it appears most probable, that the rising, not the 

setting, was generally called » >>.] [In many 

instances,] iljiVI signifies The Mansions of the 
Moon [themselves]; and iy, any one of those 
Mansions: and they are also called [the 

stars, or asterisms, of rain]. (Mgh, in art. '-^.) 
LAar says that the term « y was not applied except 
in the case of a star, or asterism, accompanied

Kazweenee, the 14th Mansion, which, about the 
period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 4th 
of April: the latter seems to be the s-ys j of IjjSII 
(see sya j) : i. e. JJSVI, the 17th Mansion, which, 
about the same period, set aurorally on the 13th 
of May; a period of about forty days. Then 
comes [see this word, said by some to be] 
a period of about twenty nights, commencing at 
the [auroral] rising of u'j)Jl, [at the epoch of the 
Flight about the 26th of May, O. S.,] which has

[with which ip±> is syn.] is more intense than j>>: 
in the Kur, x. 5, the sun is termed and the 
moon jp\ and it is said that is essential. 


but jp is accidental [light]: (TA:) it is of two 
kinds, the light of the present world and that of 
the world to come; and the former is either 
perceived sensibly, by the eye, and this is what 
diffuses itself from luminous bodies, as the sun 
and moon and stars, and is mentioned in the Kur, 
x. 5, referred to above; or perceived by the eye of 
the intellect, and this is what diffuses itself of the 
divine lights, as the light of reason and the light 
of the Kur-an; of which divine light mention is 
made in the Kur, v., former part of verse 18, and 
xxiv., latter part of verse 35; and both of these 
in common are spoken of in the Kur, vi. 1 and 
xxxix. 69: that of the world to come is mentioned 
in the Kur in lvii. 12 [and lxvi. 8]: (B:) the 
pi. is jljjt (S, M, Msb, K) and u 1 IP; (M, K;) the 
latter mentioned by Th: (M:) and J, kiljjj 
signifies the same as jp. (TA.) As jjj is 
a convenience of the pious in the present world 
and the world to come, it is said in the Kur, [lvii. 
13,] pjp o* Pip ^ [Wait ye for us that we 

may take of your light]. (B.) [See also kilt.] 

It is also applied to Mohammad: (T, M, K:) it is 
said by Aboo-Is-hak to be so applied in the Kur, 
v. 18. (T.) — — And That which manifests 
things, (K, TA,) and shows to the eyes their true 
or real state: and therefore jj" is applied in the 
Kur, vii. 156, to (tropical:) that 

[revelation] which the Prophet brought. (TA.) — 

— jj" is also one of the names of God; meaning, 

accord, to IAth, He by whose light the obscure 
in perception sees, and by whose guidance the 
erring is directed aright: or the Manifest, by 
whom is every manifestation. And cjljkUl kill 
^* 0^3 [in the Kur, xxiv. 35,] means God is the

Arabs observed the pronunciation termed imaleh

pronunciation is agreeable with analogy on 
account of the final kesreh,] likening 
its (tropical:) to that in 43 , [in which it is 
expressed in writing by ij,] because it is changed 
from lS : but this is extr. That is, 

this pronunciation of (tropical:) changed from lS 
or j is only observed [regularly] when the said ' is 
a final radical letter; and specially in verbs: the 
instances of this kind that occur in nouns are 
extr.; and more (???) are these in which the ' 
changed from lS is a medial radical letter. (TA.)

dial, var., as in the case of every pi. of the 
measure 14 of which the medial radical letter 
is ls: (M, F:) and pi. pi. (K, TA.) Ibn-Seena 
says that no animal has both a 4“ and a horn.

K, 434; but this is a mistake: (TA:) pi. of the 
former 44' and 4 j4 (K) and 44: (S, K:) or these 
are pis. of both the former of sing. (K. accord, to 
some copies; and TA.) Sb is of opinion that 44 is 
pi. of 44 and says that the Arabs have made it of 
the measure 44 [as it is said to be in the S, for it 
is originally 44 like as they have the pi. of j'3

dammeh, and preceded by dammeh, and 
followed by j. It is also said to be pi. of j 4 j 4; as 
it is related, on the authority of Yoo, that certain 
of the Arabs say 4= and 04 , as pis. of 44 
and 4 = 34, agreeably with the dial, of those who 
say 44 j [instead of 44 j]; namely, the tribe of

Arabs make the dim. of 4“ to be 4)4, because 
many an ' such as that in 4“ is changed from j: 
[or rather, this is generally the case:] but this, 
says Ibn-Es-Sarraj is an error on his part 
[who does (???) (S.) This apparently means, that 
Ibn-EsSarraj accuses Sh of an error; but such is 
not the case: for Sb himself says “ but this is

The imam Bedred-Deen Mudhaffar, son of the 
Kadee of Baalabekk, says, in his book entitled 
Suroor en-Nefs, that it is of many species; 
whereof [one or more] in Syria, used in perfume; 
and a species in Egypt, blue; and that its 
temperament is cold and moist in the second 
degree; that the smelling it is useful against hot 
diseases, and anxiety; and its juice in like 
manner; and that the beverage prepared from it 
is useful as a remedy for cough and roughness [of 
the throat] and pain of the side and chest, and is 
a laxative. The author of the Irshad and that of 
the Moojiz also mention, that the 

beverage prepared from it is an exception from 
other sweet beverages inasmuch as it does not 
become converted into yellow bile, which is 
wonderful; and its oil is more cold and moist 
than that of violets; and there is no flower more 
cold and moist than it. Er-Razee, too, says that 
the smelling it is one of the causes of weakening 
the generative faculty, and that the beverage is 
one of the causes of stopping it; [for 
which purpose, or as an antiaphrodisiac, it is 
used in the present day by some of the women of 
Cairo;] notwithstanding which, it rejoices the 
heart, and is useful for palpitation of the heart.

emigration from the territory of the unbelievers 
to the territory of the believers, or to any place of 
safety or refuge on account of religious 
persecution &c.: see 3 , last signification:] a subst. 

from 331*. (Msb, TA.) [“333 1 , peculiarly, The 

emigration, or flight, (for it was really a flight,) of 
Mohammad, from Mekkeh to Yethrib, which 
latter was afterwards called El-Medeeneh. 
Hence, “333 1 The era of the Hijreh, or 

Flight. The epoch of this era is not the date of the 
Flight itself, as some have imagined, (for this 
took place on an uncertain day, most probably 
the first or second, of the third lunar month of 
the Arabian year,) but is the first day of 
the Arabian year in which the Flight happened: 


and as I believe that all European writers who 
have attempted to fix it, prior to M. Caussin 
de Perceval, have erred respecting it, the true 
date, as shown by him, (see his “ Essai sur 
l'Histoire des Arabes,” &c., in the places referred 
to in the index to that work,) I think it important 
here to mention. The first year of the Flight was 
the two hundred and eleventh year of a period 
during which the Arabs made use of a defective 
luni-solar reckoning, making every third year to 
consist of thirteen lunar months; the others 
consisting of twelve such months. This mode of 
reckoning was abolished by Mohammad in the 
twelfth month of the tenth year of the Flight, at 
the time of the pilgrimage; whence it appears that 
the first year of the Flight commenced, most 
probably, on Monday, the nineteenth of April, A. 
D. 622 ; or perhaps on the eighteenth; for the 
actual appearance of the new moon properly 
marked its commencement, and, as the new 
moon happened about sunset on the sixteenth, it 
may perhaps have been seen on the eve of the 
eighteenth. According to M. Caussin de Perceval, 
the first ten years of the Flight commenced at the 
following periods. ist.[Mon.]Apr. 19 , 622 
2 nd.[Sat.]May 7 , 623 
3 rd.[Th.]Apr. 26 , 624 
4 th.[Mon.]Apr. 15 , 625 
5 th.[Sat.]May. 3 , 626 
6 th.[Th.]Apr. 23 , 627 
7 th.[Tu.]Apr. 12 , 628 
8 th.[Mon.]May. 1 , 629 
9 th.[Fri.]Apr. 20 , 630 
ioth.[Tu.]Apr. 9 , 631 

Thus it appears that the first and fourth and 
seventh years were of thirteen lunar months 
each; and the seventh was the last year that 
was thus augmented: therefore, with the eighth 
year commenced the reckoning by common lunar 
years; and from this point we may use the tables 
which have often been published for finding the 
periods of commencement of years of the Flight. 
We must not, however, rely upon the exact 
accuracy of these tables: for the commencement 
of the month was generally determined by actual 
observation of the new moon; not by 
calculation; and we often find that a year was 
commenced, according as the place 
of observation was low or high, or to the east or 
west of the place to which the calculation is 
adapted, or according as the sky was obscure 
or clear, a day later or earlier than that which is 
indicated in the tables; and in some cases, even 
two days later. The twelfth day of the third month 
of the first year of the Flight, the day of 
Mohammad's arrival at Kuba, was Monday: 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version VI. 1 2883 


therefore the first day of the year was most 
probably the nineteenth of April, as two months 
of thirty days each, or twenty-nine days each, 
seldom occur together. But the tenth day of the 
first month of the sixty-first year, the day on 
which El-Hoseyn was slain at Kerbela, was 
Friday: therefore the first day of that year, at that 
place, must have been Wednesday, the third of 
October, A. D. 680; not the first of October, as in 
most of the published tables above mentioned.

[wherefore it signifies Excellent, or how

its superlative sense, to the class of verbs of 
wonder, and to yj and itt. He further remarks, 
that they [the Arabs] have abstained from 
forming a verb on the measure JAa [variable as to 
person, tense, and mood,] from one whose 
medial radical letter is is, fearing to make what is 
difficult to pronounce still more so; for in that 
case they would be obliged to say cji yi ; 
and IA y; and, as would also happen if a variable 
verb of the same measure were formed from one

a corruption happening to the substance of the

the result of bloody battles. Accord, to the 
hakeem Da-ood, it is a change effected in the air 
by events in the higher regions, as the 
conjunction of beaming stars; and by events in 
the lower regions, as bloody battles, and the 
opening of graves, and the ascending of putrid 
exhalations; with which causes conspire the 
changes of the seasons and elements, and 
the revolutions of the universe. They mention 
also its signs; among which are fever, small-pox, 
defluxions, itch or scab, tumours, &c. What 
is said in the Nuzheh necessarily implies that 
the jjcli is one of the different kinds of kj; as 
the physicians hold to be the case: but 
the opinion which the critics among the 
professors of practical law and the relaters of 
traditions hold is, that these two diseases are 
distinct, the one from the other; the kj being an 
unwholesomeness in the air, in consequence of 


which diseases become common among men; 
and the um'-A being that kind [of disease] with 
which men are smitten by the jinn, or genii: an

found, experienced, or became sensible of, 
satiety]. Also, The finding, &c., by the intellect, or 
by means of the intellect: of which kind is one's

interchangeable for Ai when used as an

from these two, there is a difference in usage. 
The latter is used in affirmative phrases as a

Abu-l-'Abbas says, that this is not agreeable with

bears for the king the burden of administration: 
(S, * Msb:) or it is from 1 jjj, signifying “ a 
mountain to which one has recourse to save 
himself from destruction: ” so the jjjj of the

that *** j is one of the verbs which signify He 
caused to be, or to become: and he cites the

is only used in the pret. tense. Others assert it to 

be rare. (TA.) *4a 4 !* Suppose me; 

syn. 4*4; (AHei, cited by Fei;) or count me, or

away; syn. 441. (So in two copies of the S:

(S:) but it is not used in this sense in the pret., 
nor in the aor.: (S, K:) you do not say *4i ciik j 
[I supposed thee to have done that]: nor (as 
some assert, Msb,) do you say *4i 4 4*, (TA,)

say, respecting the class of verbs to which <-44 
belongs, that 4 and o) [with what follows them] 
may supply the place of the two objective 
complements, [as when you say 4 j 4

the reverse is perhaps the case, because the

and others to the falling into destruction. Accord, 
to what is said by Z, in the Falk, and gjj 
and denote compassion: but 5j is used in 
reviling, and imprecating destruction. (MF.) IKtt 
says, in the Tahdheeb el-Afal, that the invariable 
verbs are nine in number: 44 and and 54 
and and the verb of wonder and 43 
and 4-5 and 4j3 and 44 j; hut that El-Mazinee

terminations, both in addressing a person and in 
speaking of one who is absent, (TA,) and <43,

IAar, (K,) who adds, except the 5, who, it 
appears, from his saying this, give fet-h to the m: 
(TA:) the meaning of all which is, May God make 

woe (5j) to cleave to thee! [and to Zeyd! 

&c.: or Woe to thee! &c.: but see what is said 
above.] (S, K.) Dhu-l-Khirak Et-Tuhawee 

uses y-yj in the sense of 5j, addressing to a wolf 
the ejaculation ^ 54 53, [which is therefore the 
same in meaning as 55]: (TA:) but accord, to 
what is said by Z, in the Falk, 55 and 311 5j &c. 
signify Mercy on thee! or the like. (MF.) 
When is put in the acc. case, it is so put as an 
inf. n. (S.) This is the opinion generally 
obtaining: the opinion that 5j is a verb is 
extraordinary. (TA.) When you use the prep. J, 
you [generally say] 45 44 j (or 45 45, L): when 
you use J, it is more elegant to put in the 
nom. case, as an inchoative, than in the acc. case: 
but when you use syj as a prefixed noun, with its 
complement, the acc. is more elegant than 
the nom. case: [i. e., it is more elegant to say 44j 
43 than 43 53]. (S, L.) Ks says, Some of the 
Arabs say 55 and 55 5j; and some of 

them say 44 45, like 44 53. (TA.) 15 45

very nearly, to five English bushels.] j4j gj j a

(AZ:) and 54j denotes the same as gu; (AZ;) or

one's beauty; as when you say of a child, !-« 445 
and <=3J ^ <45, [Mercy on him! or the 
like: how beautiful is he!] (Kh) or, accord, to 
most of the lexicologists, Jjj is a word said to, or 
of, any one who falls into destruction or trial, or 
misfortune, and on whom one does not wish 
God's mercy: and gjj is said to, or of, any one 
who falls into trial or misfortune, and for 
whom one wishes God's mercy, and his escape 
therefrom: the former word being so used in the 
Kur-an, and the latter by the Prophet: (T:) or Jjj 
is said to, or of, him who falls into destruction: 
and gjj is a word by which one chides him who is 
at the point of falling into destruction: (Sb:) 


or gjj and Jjj are syn., (Yz, En-Nadr, S, Ibn-Et- 
Faraj,) and l«j signifies the same: (Ibn-El-

(M, TA:) or, as some say, 54j is a word denoting 
contempt; and has no verb; analogy forbidding 
that it should have one: (IJ, M:) Aboo-Turab 
says, I heard Abu-sSemeyda' say, 54j and 4j

said except to children; and ^14j is an expression 
in which is roughness and reproach; and jjj is a 
gentle and good expression. (AHat, TA.) 

See £5 and 53 and 44j. It also signifies 

Poverty. (ISk, M.) And one may say, if it be right 
to say so to one, 4 54j as meaning Poverty be to 

him. (ISk.) Also, What a man desires. (M,

(As, S, TA,) and is of the dial, of the 
higher classes of Mudar, as are also the similar 
instances, but the former is of the dial, of the 
lower classes of the Mudar; (AZ, S, Msb, TA;) or, 
as Sb says, accord, to his companions, the verb 
was originally of two forms, 04), aor. o45, 
and 3*4, aor. o45, and a compound [which 
is 04) having o45 for its aor.] was then formed 
from the two; but as to 3? j, aor. 34, and 3)4, 
aor. 34, and fjj. aor. fj), and 3)4, aor. J), 
and 34s, aor. 34, and £yj, aor. *jj), in each of 
these only one form is allowable, with the kesr; 
(S, TA;) and some change the second <s of 
the aor. of o*5 into I, and say o44 and 3**4; (Mbr, 
S, TA;) and I'Ab reads, in the Kur. xii. 87, Ot), 
after the manner of the dial, of those 
who pronounce the first letter of the aor. with 
kesr excepting such as is with lS [for its first 
letter], (K, TA,) which dial, is that of Temeem and 
Keys and Hudheyl and Asad; (Ks, Lh, TA;) the 
case of lS being made an exception by them 
because kesr with that letter is difficult 
of pronunciation; (Sb, TA;) but some of the 
Benoo-Kelb pronounce lS also with kesr, which is 
extr.; (Fr, Lb, TA:) and this is done in 
the instances of o4a and 34) because one 1 j is 
here strengthened by another; (K, TA;) [I find 
also, in a copy of the M, 0*4), as an extr. form of 
the aor. of this verb, on the authority of Sb; but it 
is doubtless a mistranscription for o*4); and there 
is another evident mistranscription in a 
quotation from Sb immediately following in 
that copy, relating to aors. of the form of 3*4), 
which has been rendered correctly above, in the 
present work, from the TA;] inf. n. 3*4 (S, M, A,

M,) and (ibn-’Abbad, M, K, TA [but in a MS. 
copy of the K I find it written <-*4; and in the 
CK, *-*Aj ; ]) and 34)! is also used as an inf. n. of 
this verb, though properly an inf. n. of 4; (Msb;) 
He despaired of the thing; syn. of the inf. n. -4 4a, 
(S, A, K,) contr. of *43: (M, A, K:) or he cut off 


hope of the thing: (A, K: *) or his hope of the 
thing became cut off: (Mgh:) and 1 o45*“! 
signifies the same, (S, A, K,) in like 
manner followed by 4“; (S;) and so does 1 o* 1 *!, 
(S, K,) [originally 3*4)!,] of the measure but 
with incorporation [of the lS into the *j]. (S.) It is 
allowable to transpose the letters of 34), so as to 
say 1 34; but not those of the inf. n. (Msb.) There 
is not a word in the Arabic language commencing 
with ls followed by * except 34) [and its 

derivatives] (IKtt) [and 44 and its derivatives, 
and words commencing with an augmentative o 
followed by a radical A 4]. The expression 3" o*4 V 
Jj4. occurring in a description of Mohammad, 
means that his stature was such as would 
not make [one] to despair of his height; for he 
was nearer to tallness than he was to shortness: 
(K, * TA:) o*4 is here an indeterminate 

noun governed in the accus. case by the 

negative V: (TA:) or, accord, to one relation, the 
words are, J4 3 3“ o**4 V, [in the CK, 

erroneously, o*)4 ^,] meaning, that his height 
was not despaired of; i. e., he who vied with him 
in tallness would not despair of him on account 
of his excessive height: (K, TA:) so that o*)4 is 
here in the sense of o*jj4s like 3® 1 - *U in the 

sense of 34)-“. (TA.) [Hence,] Jijill c33jThe 

woman was, or became, barren. (Msb.) 34), 

(S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor. 345 and 34)), (M,) also 
signifies (tropical:) He knew; syn. 4^; (S, M, A, 
Msb, K;) in the dial, of En-Nakha’; (S, Msb;) or, 
accord, to El-Kelbee, (M,) or Ibn-El-Kelbee, (TA,) 
in the dial, of Wahbeel, a tribe of En-Nakha'; or, 
accord, to El-Kasim Ibn-Maan, of the dial, of 
Hawazin. (M, TA.) So in the Kur. [xiii. 30] fSi 
3)4' o*5) [Do not then those who have 
believed know?]: (S, M, Msb, K:) or, accord, to 
some of the lexicologists, do not then those who 
have believed know with a knowledge wherewith 
they despair of its being otherwise than what 
they know? or the meaning is, do not then those 
who have believed despair of the belief of those 
whom God has described as those who will 
not believe? (M, TA;) but I' Ab (M, TA) and 'Alee 
and others (TA) used to read I >4 3)4' 354 4';
