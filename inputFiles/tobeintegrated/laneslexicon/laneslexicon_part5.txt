PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

EDITOR'S PREFACE. 


SINCE the Fifth Part of this work was published, the hand that wrote it has become still. After thirty- 
four years of labour at the Lexicon, Mr. Lane died, on the tenth of August, 1876. 

It was his special wish that the work which had occupied so large a part of his life should be 
completed by me, and that wish absolves me from the charge of presumption to which I might 
otherwise be exposed. To complete it as it has been begun is indeed beyond the power of any living 
Orientalist: but I hope that, so far as knowledge of my Uncle's methods of work and jealous love for 
his memory may avail, I may not prove altogether unworthy of the great trust he reposed in me. 

Informed of my purpose, Her Grace the Dowager Duchess of Northumberland immediately 
offered to continue to the work that generous support which she had given during my Uncle's life. 

A careful examination of the manuscripts and notes which my Uncle had accumulated convinced 
me that there was more to be done than I had at first supposed. I found articles in three different 
stages: some consisting only of Mr. Lane's own notes, without any reference to the original 
authorities; others written, but needing to be collated with one or two manuscripts acquired later; and 
some completely written and ready for the press. The difference is explained by the fact that Mr. Lane 
was of necessity obliged to write in the order of the Sihah, and that as the printers gradually 
approached him he finished those articles which were likely to be speedily wanted: for he began to 
print when he had written rather more than half the work. The notes of his own were simply the 
results of his long experience in the language, and were to be interwoven with the translations from 
the original authorities when the articles came to be written. 

At the time of his death my Uncle was engaged on the article -A Up to this point every article is 
ready for the printers. Of the rest the majority are written, but some need collation. 

In these circumstances I think it best to publish in Part VI. only to the end of the letter A part 
of the following letter is not completed, and to fill the lacunae would delay the publication of the 
volume. The present Part therefore contains only £ and ‘-A Up to p. 2386 the proofs were corrected by 
Mr. Lane; after that, by myself. The next Part, which I shall bring out so soon as is compatible with 
sound work and careful printing, will contain <j, J, and the last, u, j, <J. After the publication of 
Part VIII., I shall begin to prepare Book II., comprising the rare words and curat; Xsydjusva, which Mr. 
Lane estimated as two Parts, or one thick Part. 

The appearance of this Part has been delayed by the difficulties presented in the composition of 
the Memoir which is prefixed. I have had to tell the story of a life spent, partly on account of ill health, 
but mainly for the sake of work, in seclusion! Few men knew Mr. Lane personally in his later years, 



PREFACE. 


and as time went on and the improbability of his living to finish his work became more and more 
apparent, his unwillingness to see anyone beyond his family circle and a few special friends became 
stronger than ever. Thus I have had no assistance from the recollections of friends. Nor have I derived 
the smallest help from letters. Mr. Lane had a deeply-rooted objection to the publication of letters 
meant only for private friends, and he took care to have all his own letters from Egypt destroyed; 
whilst after his return to England he hardly ever wrote one except on questions of scholarship which 
he was asked to decide. 

Thus the only materials I have had for the foundation of the Memoir have been (l) the MS. of the 
"Description of Egypt," which contains a certain amount of personal incident; (2) certain note-books 
kept by Mr. Lane during his first and second visits to Egypt; (3) his published works; (4) his sister's 
journal, kept during the third visit to Egypt, and certain passages in her " English-woman in Egypt." I 
should add that Mrs. Lane, my Grandmother Mrs. Poole, and my Uncle Reginald Stuart Poole, have 
aided me greatly with their recollections. For the last ten years I can of course write from my own 
intimate relations with my Great-Uncle. 

The diary of Mr. Lane's second visit to Egypt I have thought it well to reproduce almost in 
cxtenso. As the daily jotting-down of what he called his "idle moments" it reveals something of 
himself, and as the record of the changes which nearly ten years had brought about in the country it 
will be acceptable to students of the history of Europeanizing in Egypt. 


July, 1877. 


STANLEY LANE POOLE. 



POSTSCRIPT 


The present Part completes the publication of the MS. materials which Mr. Lane left for the continuation of 
his Lexicon. The incompleteness of these materials has already been explained in the Preface to Part V. My 
original intention was to compile the missing articles from Mr. Lane's MS. copy of the Taj-el-'Aroos, with the 
addition of such notes as he had himself prepared during the progress of the work. This intention, however, 
was modified when the publication of the Taj-el-'Aroos at Boolak deprived Mr. Lane's MS. copy of its peculiar 
importance. The text can now be consulted by any scholar for himself, and to offer a bare translation of it, in a 
Lexicon intended mainly for the use of scholars, would be superfluous. The great value of Mr. Lane's work lies 
not so much in his translations from standard works of Arabic lexicography, as in the comments and 
explanations which he was able to add from his own profound knowledge of the language and its literature. Any 
scholar can translate the Taj-el-'Aroos: but none could have elucidated the obscurities of the native 
lexicographers with the precision and illumination which characterize Mr. Lane's commentary. The translation 
from the Taj-el-'Aroos has therefore been abandoned, and the Supplement appended to the present Part, 
instead of containing all the articles omitted from Parts V.-VIIL, includes only such notes as Mr. Lane had 
made from time to time with a view to the eventual writing of these articles. These notes are not to be accepted 
as the final decision of their writer, far less as finished or even approximately complete articles. They have not 
enjoyed the benefit of his revision, and many of them are clearly the record of contemporary speech, which he 
would doubtless have excluded from a Lexicon of the classical language. Nevertheless, Mr. Lane's habitual 
accuracy and caution are sufficient guarantees that these notes were not made without careful deliberation. 
They contain many significations which are not to be found in the ordinary dictionaries; and the numerous 
cross-references, which I have verified, will prove of service, and to some extent supply the want of more 
complete explanations, especially for the commonest meanings of words. The notes refer chiefly to the less 
common meanings, and those most familiar to the student will often be found missing. 

With regard to the "Book II." which Mr. Lane contemplated, and which was to contain rare words and 
explanations, I am obliged to admit that the materials are wanting. Some few articles are partly prepared, but 
are not sufficient to warrant any prospect of this part of the work being completed. It is the less needed since 
the publication of the late Professor Dozy's valuable Supplement. 

Fifty years have passed since Mr. Lane undertook to write this Lexicon, and thirty since the first Part 
appeared. If there has been considerable delay in the production of the recent Parts, I must plead that the 
collation, revision, and verification of about two thousand columns of this work represent no little labour; and 
this duty has had to be done in the midst of other and no less pressing occupations. 

S. LANE-POOLE. 

l st January, 1893. 



EDWARD WILLIAM LANE 


1801—1825. 

The life of a great scholar should not be suffered to pass away into forgetfulness. The Arabs have indeed a 
proverb, 'He who has left works behind him dies not': but although so long as there are students of the life and 
the literature of the East, the memory of Lane cannot die, the personality of the great Orientalist is rigidly 
excluded from his writings; they reveal almost nothing of himself. If .to stimulate the endeavours of others by 
the example of a chief of their kind, to encourage fainter hearts by telling them of the strength and devotion of a 
master, be one of the ends of biography, this brief and inadequate memoir of perhaps the truest and most 
earnest student this century has seen will not be deemed superfluous. As the record of half a hundred years of 
ceaseless labour, crowned with a perfection of scholarship to which even Germany avowedly yields the palm of 
undisputed supremacy, the life of Lane must needs be written. 

Edward William Lane was born at Hereford on September 17th, 1801. He was the third son of the Rev. 
Theophilus Lane, LL.D., a Prebendary of Hereford; and his mother was Sophia Gardiner, a niece of 
Gainsborough the Painter. At first his education was conducted by his father, after whose sudden death in 1814 
he was placed successively at the grammar-schools of Bath and Hereford, where he distinguished himself by his 
unusual power of application and by an almost equal mastery of classics and mathematics. The latter formed 
his principal study, for his mind was bent upon taking a degree at Cambridge, and then entering the Church. 
This desire to devote himself to a religious profession may have had its origin in the training of his mother, 
under whose influence his education was completed. Mrs. Lane was a woman of no ordinary mould. Gifted 
with high intellectual powers, which she had spared no pains to cultivate, she possessed a strength and beauty 
of character that won not only admiration but affection from all who were privileged to know her. It is easy to 
understand how great and how good must have been the influence of such a mother upon Edward Lane. He 
was wont to say that he owed his success in life to her teaching, and the saying, characteristic in its modesty, 
was doubtless partly true. His success was the result as much of character as of intellect. 

The Cambridge project was never carried out. Lane indeed visited the university, but did not enter his 
name on the books of any college. A few days' experience of university life as it was in the first quarter of this 
century was sufficient to show him that in living in such society as he was then introduced to, and in 
conforming to its ways, he would be sacrificing what was to him dearer than all academic distinctions. That his 
mathematical training had been thorough is shown by the fact that immediately after giving up the idea of 
Cambridge, Lane procured a copy of the honour papers of the year and discovered that he could without 
difficulty solve every problem save one; and, as he has often told me, going to bed weary with puzzling out this 
single stumbling-block, he successfully overcame it in his sleep and, suddenly waking up, lit his candle in the 
middle of the night and wrote out the answer without hesitation. 



VI 


MEMOIR. 


The plan of Cambridge, and with it the Church, being given up, and his later training being too exclusively 
mathematical for him to think of Oxford, Lane joined his elder brother Richard (afterwards renowned for his 
skill in lithography, which was recognized by the Royal Academy in the election to an associateship) in London, 
where he spent some time in engraving. Although this profession was also shortly abandoned, the years 
devoted to it were not thrown away. The taste for art which he had inherited with the Gainsborough blood and 
which his mother, who had spent a great part of her girlhood in her uncle's studio, spared no endeavour to 
foster, aided by the mechanical training of the graver, was afterwards turned to admirable results in Egypt. Side 
by side with his engraving, however, was the growing passion for Eastern things. Lane could not by his nature 
be idle for a moment, and the hours unfilled by his art were given up to hard reading. To such an extent was 
this zeal for study carried, that he began to grudge the time necessary for food and exercise. The result of 
inattention to the ordinary rules of health was a state of weakness that could offer but a faint resistance to the 
attack of typhus fever which now assailed him. With difficulty escaping with his life, he found his health 
unequal to the sedentary habits of the engraver. A man who was so weak, partly from the exhaustion of chronic 
bronchitis, and partly from the effects of the fever, that he sometimes could not walk along a street without 
clinging for support, was not fit to bend over copper-plate all day. He therefore determined to adopt some other 
way of life. 

As early as 1822, Eastern studies had more than merely attracted Lane's interest. A manuscript grammar 
of colloquial Arabic in his handwriting bears this date: and he must have been studying some time before he 
could attempt a grammar of Arabic, even though it is only an abridgement of other works. From this year or 
earlier dates that severe devotion to the language and character of the Arabs which for more than half a century 
filled every moment of his studious life. 

It was this taste for Oriental matters, seconded by his weak health, which could ill withstand a northern 
winter, that determined Lane to visit Egypt. Another motive may have been the hope of a post in the service of 
the British Government, which, he was informed by those who were qualified to speak, he stood a good chance 
of obtaining if he made himself well acquainted with Easterns at home. Whatever the motives, in 1825 Lane left 
England for the first of his three visits to the land of the Pharaohs. 



1825—1828. 

THE FIRST VISIT TO EGYPT. 


The "Description of Egypt. " 

ON Monday the 18th July 1825 Lane embarked on board the brig "Findlay," 212 tons, bound for 
Alexandria, and on the 24th he lost sight of the coast of England. The voyage, which occupied two months, was 
not altogether uneventful. On the 2nd September the " ' Findlay" nearly foundered in a hurricane off Tunis. The 
master seems to have been an incapable person, and no one else of the crew understood navigation. The night 
was starless; the sea ran so high that the heavy storm-compass in the binnacle could not traverse and was 
unshipped at every lurch; and, driven along between a lee shore and a dangerous reef, without compass, and 
the main topmast carried away, the ship seemed doomed to destruction. It was at this critical moment that the 
captain entreated Lane to take the helm. Fortunately navigation had formed part of his mathematical studies: 
but he was little more than a boy and this was his first voyage; he might well have shrunk from the 
responsibility. But he went at once to the wheel, where he had to be lashed, or he had been washed overboard 
by the seas that swept momently over the deck. He had noticed the bearings of the lightning, and by the flashes 
he steered. At last the moon rose, and by her light the wreck was cleared away and steering was less hazardous. 
As day dawned the wind abated, and Lane was able to bring the ship safely into Malta harbour on the morning 
of the 4th. Here she remained six days for repair; and meanwhile the crew mutinied, seemingly not without 
reason; and Lane was aroused one morning with a shot through his pillow,. He had come prepared for dangers 
in Egypt, and these accidents by the way did not discompose him. On Monday the 19th September the shores of 
the Delta came in sight: first the ruined tower of Aboo-Seer rose above the horizon; then "a tall distant sail," 
which proved to be the Great Pillar of Alexandria; then high hills of rubbish, crowned with forts; and at last the 
ships in the Old Harbour. The "Findlay" was ordered to enter the New Harbour, and there cast anchor in the 
midst of a shoal of Rosetta boats. 

Although it was late in the afternoon and little could be seen before dark, Lane was too impatient to wait 
for the next day. He landed filled with profound emotion, feeling, he writes, like an Eastern bridegroom about 
to lift the veil of his as yet unseen bride. For his was not the case of an ordinary traveller. "I was not visiting 
Egypt merely for my amusement; to examine its pyramids and temples and grottoes, and after satisfying my 
curiosity to quit it for other scenes and other pleasures: but I was about to throw myself entirely among 
strangers, among a people of whom I had heard the most contradictory accounts; I was to adopt their language, 
their customs, and their dress; and in order to make as much progress as possible in the study of their 
literature, it was my intention to associate almost exclusively with the Muslim, inhabitants." 

The first sight that met his eye was singularly impressive. It was the time of afternoon prayers, and the 
chant of the Mueddin had just ceased as they landed. Muslims were performing the ablutions at the sea, or, this 
done, were praying on the beach, with that solemn gravity and with those picturesque and striking attitudes 
which command the respect of all standers-by. Lane always felt a strong veneration for a Muslim at his prayers, 
and it was a singularly auspicious moment for an enthusiastic Englishman to set foot on the Egyptian soil. As

he walked on, till he reached one of the principal streets, his delight and wonder grew at every step. The 
peculiar appearance of the narrow street and its shops, the crowded passengers of every nation bordering on 
the Mediterranean, the variety of costume and countenance, the "bearded visage of the Turk, the Moor, and the 
Egyptian,— the noble and hardy look of the sunburnt Bedawee enveloped in his ample woollen sheet or hooded 
cloak,— the mean and ragged clothing of many of the lower orders, contrasted with the gaudy splendour or 
graceful habit of some of their superiors,— the lounging soldier with his pipe and pistols and yataghan,— the 
blind beggar,— the dirty naked child, and the veiled female," afforded a picture beyond even what his dreams of 
the land of the Arabian Nights had conjured up. It is true the shady side of the scene was somewhat forcibly 
disclosed a few paces further on, by a brawl, a murder, and a decapitation, all occurring in the space of a few 
minutes before the eyes of the young traveller. And as he examined Alexandria at leisure, he began to feel 
disappointed with it, and to long for Cairo. Notwithstanding the characteristic sights that first greeted him, the 
city was not Eastern enough, and he would have found his stay there wearisome but for the kindness and 
hospitality of Mr. Salt, the British Consul-General, who received him like an old friend, although they were 
strangers to each other, and gave him a room in his country-house near the Babes-Sidr. Lane found a 
"delightful retreat" in Mr. Salt's garden and plenty of entertainment in the company that visited the Consul. 
One of these friends, M. Linant, the indefatigable cartographer of Egypt, proposed that Lane should join his 
party to Cairo, an offer which, as a stranger and as yet unprovided with a servant, he gladly accepted. 

On the 28th September the Reyyis and crew chanted the Fat.'hah, the beautiful prayer which opens the 
Kur-an, and M. Linant and his party, accompanied by Lane, set sail on the Mahmoodeeyeh canal for the "El- 
Kahirah the Guarded." The voyage was in no wise remarkable. Lane made his usual careful notes of everything 
he saw, from the sarab to the creaking of the sakiyehs and the croaking of the frogs. He described each village 
or town he passed, and observed the ways of the people working on shore or bathing in the Nile; and watched 
the simple habits of the boatmen, when the boat was made fast and their day's work was over, grouped round 
the fire on the bank, smoking and singing, and blowing their terrible double-pipes and making night hideous 
with their national drums; and then contentedly spreading their mats, and, despising pillow and covering, 
falling happily asleep. On the 2nd October Lane had his first distant and hazy view of the Pyramids, and about 
five o'clock the boat was moored at Boolak, the port of Cairo, and the Reyyis thanked God for their safe 
arrival— "El-hamdu li-llah bi-s-sclameh." 

They rode at once to the city to tell the Vice-Consul of their arrival, that rooms might be made ready for 
them in Mr. Salt's house. The first view of Cairo delighted Lane even more than he had expected, and here at 
least, where all was thoroughly Eastern and on a grand scale, no after disappointment could be expected. When 
he saw the numberless minarets towering above the wilderness of flat-roofed houses, and in turn crowned by 
the citadel, with the yellow ridge of El-Mukattam in the background, Lane took heart again and rejoiced in the 
prospect of his future home. The next day he took up his quarters at the Consulate, abandoned his English 
dress and adopted the Turkish costume, and set out to look for a house. He soon found one near the Bab-el- 
Hadeed, belonging to ’Osman, a Scotsman in the employ of the British Consul, who proved a very useful 
neighbor and a faithful friend. The furniture, after the usual native pattern, always a simple affair in the East, 
was quickly procured and the house was soon ready for his reception.

These matters took up the first five days in Cairo: but on the 8th October, every thing being in a fair way to 
completion at the house, a small party of Europeans, with Lane among them, made an excursion to the 
Pyramids. It was only a flying visit, to take the edge off his ardent curiosity, for he meant to go again and make 
careful drawings and measurements. He explored the Great Pyramid, and then in the night climbed to its 
summit and enjoyed a sight such as one hardly sees twice in a lifetime. The cold wind sweeping up the sides, 
with a sound like the roar of a distant cataract, echoed the weird feeling of the place and the time, with which 
the vaguely vast outline of the Second Pyramid, faintly discernable, and the wild figures of the Bedawee guides 
were in full harmony. Then the moon rose and lighted up the eastern side of the nearer pyramid with a magic 
effect. Two hours more and the sun had revealed the plain of Egypt, and Lane had been already amply 
rewarded for the dangers and trouble of his journey from England by one of the most wonderful views in the 
world. 

After two months spent in Cairo, in the study of the people and their language, and in seeing the thousand 
beautiful things that the most picturesque of cities could then show, Lane again visited the Pyramids, this time 
for a fortnight, armed with stores and necessaries for living, and with materials for drawing and surveying, 
above all the camera Lucida, with which all his drawings were made. 

He took up his abode in a tomb of an unusually luxurious kind. It had three holes for windows, and was 
altogether about eight feet wide by twice as long, with a partition wall in the middle. Before the door was the 
usual accumulation of bones and rags, and even whole bodies of mummies: but the contemplation of these 
details gave Lane no unpleasant sensations; he merely observed that the skulls were extraordinarily thick. Into 
this cheerful habitation the baggage was carried, and thought at first the interior looked "rather gloomy," when 
"the floor was swept, and a mat, rug, and mattress spread in the inner apartment, a candle lighted, as well as 
my pipe, and my arms hung about upon wooden pegs driven into crevices in the wall,"— the paintings had been 
effaced long before,—" I looked around me with complacency, and felt perfectly satisfied." He was waited on by, 
his two servants, an Egyptian and a Nubian, whom he had brought from Cairo, and at the door were two Arabs 
hired from the neighbouring village to guard against passing Bedawees. All day long he was engaged in drawing 
and describing and making plans; and then in the evening he would come out on the terrace in front of the 
tomb, and sit in the shade of the rock (at Christmastide), drinking his coffee and smoking his long chibook, and 
"enjoying the mild air and the delightful view over the plain towards the capital." 

"In this tomb I took up my abode for a fortnight, and never did I spend a more happy time, though 
provided with fewer articles of luxury than I might easily and reasonably have procured. My appearance 
corresponded with my mode of living; for on account of my being exposed to considerable changes of 
atmospheric temperature in passing in and out of the Great Pyramid, I assumed the Hiram (or woollen sheet) 
of the Bedawee, which is a most convenient dress under such circumstances; a part or the whole being thrown 
about the person according to the different degrees of warmth which he may require. I also began to accustom 
myself to lay aside my shoes on many occasions, for the sake of greater facility in climbing and descending the 
steep and smooth passages of the pyramid, and would advise others to do the same. Once or twice my feet were 
slightly lacerated; but after two or three days they were proof against the sharpest stones. From the 
neighbouring villages I procured all that I wanted in the way of food; as eggs, milk, butter, fowls, and camels' 
flesh; but bread was not to be obtained anywhere nearer than the town of El-Geezeh, without employing a 
person to make it. One family, consisting of a little old man named 'Alee, his wife (who was not half his equal in 
years), and a little daughter, occupied a neighbouring grotto, guarding some antiquities deposited there by

Caviglia. Besides these I had no nearer neighbours than the inhabitants of a village about a mile distant." The 
solitude, however, was broken two days after his arrival by the appearance of a young Bedawee, who frankly 
confessed he had deserted from the Pasha's army and could not enter the villages, and claimed Lane's 
hospitality, which was of course immediately granted. The young fellow used to amuse his host in the evening, 
while he smoked his pipe, by telling the famous stories from the romance of Aboo-Zeyd, all the while exciting 
the indignation of the Egyptian servant by his contempt for the Fellaheen. He stayed till Lane left, and when the 
latter asked him where he would find protection now, he replied with characteristic reliance upon providence, 
"Who brought you here?" 

After a fortnight in his tomb at the Pyramids of EI-Geezeh, spent in making drawings and plans of the 
pyramids and the surrounding tombs, Lane returned to Cairo on New Year's Eve. Here for two months and a 
half he devoted himself to the study of the "Mother of the World" and her inhabitants. Already possessed of an 
accurate knowledge of the modern Arabic language; being conformed to the customs of the people in all such 
external matters as dress and manners and outward habit of life; and being of that calm and self-possessed 
nature absolutely necessary to one who would be intimate with Eastern, and moreover of a cast of countenance 
resembling so closely that of a pure Arab family of Mekkeh that an Egyptian, though repeatedly assured of the 
mistake, persisted in his belief that the reputed Ingleezee was a member of that family; Lane was able, as 
scarcely one other European has been, to mix among the people of Cairo as one of themselves, and to acquire 
not only the refinements of their idiomatic speech and the minute details of their etiquette, but also a perfect 
insight into their habits of mind and ways of thought. The Spirit of the East is a scaled book to ninety-nine out 
of every hundred orientalists. To Lane it was transparent. He knew the inner manners of the Egyptian's mind 
as well as those of his outer life. And this was the result of the many years he lived among the people of Cairo, 
of which these few months in 1826 were the beginning. 

His life at this time, however, was not wholly spent among Easterns. There was still a European side. He 
was one of the brilliant group of discoverers who were then in Egypt: and young as he was he was received 
among them with cordial welcome and unfeigned appreciation. Within the charmed circle to which Lane was 
now admitted were men such as Wilkinson and James Burton (afterwards Haliburton), the hieroglyphic 
scholars; Linant and Bonomi; the travellers Humphreys, Hay, and Fox- Strangways; the accomplished Major 
Felix, and his distinguished friend Lord Prudhoc, of whose noble appreciation of Lane's work much will 
presently be said. With such friends and in such a city as Cairo, the life of the young orientalist must have been 
enviable. 

But the time had now come for the first Nile-voyage. The journey from Alexandria to Cairo had not 
damped the enthusiastic longing with which Lane looked forward to the upper country-Thebes and Philae and 
Denderah. He determined to ascend to the Second Cataract, a limit further than most travellers then ventured 
and beyond which travelling was almost impossible. In March 1826 the hired a boat, for twenty-five dollars a 
month, manned by a crew of eight men, who were to find their own provisions, and on the 15th he embarked, 
set his cabin in order and sailed. 

Lane's plan was, in the up-voyage to see in a cursory manner everything that could be seen, and in the 
down-voyage to make the notes and drawings from which he intended to construct his "Description of Egypt." 
In the up-voyage we see him sailing from one place of interest to another, with as little delay as possible; 
spending the whole day in walking to some ruin at a distance from the bank, and so the next day, and every

day, so long as there was anything worth visiting on shore. As a sightseer in Egypt Lane was indefatigable. He 
would walk on the hot plain, with the thermometer at 112 0 in the shade, till his feet were blistered, and he had 
to throw himself on his back to relieve them from the burning of the sand. When there was nothing to take him 
on shore, he would smoke his pipe on deck, and watch the people in the villages as he passed, or rest his eyes 
on the long lines of palms and dom and nabk trees that fringe the bank. Sometimes a compulsory variety was 
made by the wind dropping, when the boatmen would turn out and drag the tow-rope. Or the boat was kept for 
days in an uninteresting place by a wind against which towing was vain labour. A sandstorm would now and 
then cause an unpleasant diversion, and not only keep Lane in his cabin, but follow him there and fill every 
crevice. It was quite another matter, though, with the sand-pillar; which was the work of an 'Efreet, who stirred 
up the dust in his flight, and, being an 'Efreet, might be amenable to persuasion. Lane encountered one of these 
pillars of sand in one of his walks, and following the instructions of his guide he accosted the 'Efreet with the 
cry of "Hadeed" ("iron"), and the sprite passed at a respectful distance. The modern life of Egypt claimed the 
traveller's attention no less than the ancient. He visited the tombs of the Sheykh El-Hareedee and the Sheykh 
'Abd-el-Kadir El-Geelanee, and went through the usual ceremonies with a precision in which no Muslim could 
find a fault; he received the calls of the various dignitaries on the way with the utmost courtesy, although he 
was obliged to decline the presents of Abyssinian girls and nargeelehs which they were fond of offering; and he 
seldom missed an opportunity of strolling through an Arab town, or watching an encampment of Bedawees, 
and learning something more of the ways of the people. 

At Denderah, near the end of April, Lane met James Burton, and together they suffered from the 
Khamaseen winds, and found they could make no drawings nor leave their boats. On the 6th of May the great 
Propylasum of Thebes came in view; on the 15th at Philae, they found Linant, who had left Cairo a couple of 
days earlier. After going on to Aboo-Simbel, and then to the Second Cataract, Lane turned his boat and 
prepared to descend the Nile. Lane seems to have spent his time during the whole of this return voyage in 
drawing and measuring and describing, often sitting under an almost vertical sun, his thermometer 
occasionally bursting at 150°, and with 'no other protection from the scorching heat than a single tarboosh. At 
Philae he again found Linant, waiting for the rising of the river to pass the Cataract, and during the eight days 
they spent together there Strangways made his appearance, went to Wadee Halfeh, and then came back to 
them; and in company with him Lane continued his way down the river. Seventy-three days (July 30 to October 
11, 1826) were spent at Thebes, where he met Hay, in making a minute survey of the tombs and temples. Here 
he lived in three different houses. The first was Yani's house, among the tombs on the western side; then he 
moved to a ruined part of the first propylaeum of El-Karnak; and for fifteen days he lived in one of the Tombs of 
the Kings, for the sake of its comparative coolness. In the former abodes the thermometer ranged from go° to 
108° in the shade; but in the Tombs of the Kings it did not rise above 87°. 

Coming back to Cairo, Lane went among the people as before, busy in preparing his account of their 
manners and customs, and his description of their city. After several months thus spent,, he again started for 
the Nile, again ascended to the Second Cataract, and stayed forty-one days (November 1 to December 12, 1827) 
at Thebes, completing, his survey of the temples. And, having accomplished the great object of his travels, 
having prepared a complete description of Egypt and Lower Nubia, the country and the monuments and the 
people, he came back to Cairo in the beginning of 1828, and after a short stay at the capital, and a final visit in 



XII 


MEMOIR. 


the spring to the Pyramids of El-Geezeh and Sakkarah, in company with Hay, he returned to England in the 
autumn of the year. 

These three years of the first visit to Egypt had not been years of idleness. Lane was not the typical 
traveller, who travels for amusement, and perhaps writes a book to record his sensations for the gratification of 
an admiring public. Lane's object was a far different one. He travelled, so to say, to map the country. And his 
was a propitious time. Egypt had but recently been opened up to explorers, and no one had yet fully taken stock 
of her treasures. Hamilton, indeed, and Niebuhr had broken the ground with their books; but no systematic 
account of the country, its natural characteristics, its people, and its monuments, had yet been attempted. 
Successfully to perform such a work demanded long and unceasing labour and considerable abilities. Lane 
never shrank from toil of any kind, and he possessed just those natural gifts which were needed by one who 
should do this work. Lord Brougham once said, "I wonder if that man knows what his forte is?— Description:" 
and Brougham was right. Very few men have possessed in an equal degree the power of minutely describing a 
scene or a monument, so that the pencil might almost restore it without a fault after the lapse of years. This 
power is eminently shown in the "Description of Egypt." Every temple or tomb, every village, every natural 
feature of the country, is described in a manner that permits no improving. The objects stand before you as you 
read, and this not by the use of imaginative language, but by the plain simple description. Lane had a vehement 
hatred of "fine writing," and often expressed his dislike to those authors who are credited with the habit of 
sacrificing the truth of their statements to the fall of the sentence. He always maintained that the first thing was 
to find the right word to express your meaning, and then to let the sentence fall as it pleased. It is possible that 
in his earliest work he carried this principle a little too far; and in his most finished production, the notes to 
"The Thousand and One Nights," considerable care may be detected in the composition. But in everything he 
wrote, the prominent characteristic was perfect clearness, and nowhere is this more conspicuous than in the 
"Description of Egypt." But further, to prevent the scant possibility of mistaking the words, the work was 
illustrated by 101 sepia drawings, made with the camera lucida, (the invention of his friend Dr. Wollaston,) and 
therefore as exact as photography could make them, and far more pleasing to the eye. Those whose function it 
is to criticize artistic productions have unanimously expressed their admiration of these drawings. And though 
Lane would always say that the credit belonged to his instrument and not to himself, it is easy to see that they 
are the work of a fine pencil-hand, and could not have been done by any one who chose to look through a 
camera lucida. Altogether, both in drawings and descriptions, the book is unique of its kind. 

It has never been published. And the reason is easily seen in the expense of reproducing the drawings. 
Lane himself was never a rich man, and could not have issued the book at his own expense, and no publisher 
was found sufficiently enterprising to risk the first outlay. An eminent firm, indeed, accepted the work with 
enthusiasm, but subsequently retracted from its engagement in consequence of the paralysis of trade which 
accompanied the excitement of the Reform agitation. It is needless, however, to refer to affairs that happened 
nearly fifty years ago, although they were a cause of much annoyance and disappointment to the author of the 
'Description of Egypt"; who naturally was ill-disposed to see the work of several years wasted, and who could 
not forget the high praises that had been passed upon the book and the drawings by all who were competent to 
form an opinion. There can be no doubt in the mind of any one who has studied the manuscript and the 
drawings, that travellers in Egypt have sustained in this work a loss which has not yet been filled up, and is not 
likely to be, unless the "Description of Egypt" should yet be published.

We have seen Lane in a phase of his life distinct from all the remainder. The years 1825—28 are the only 
time in which he could be called a traveller. Even then the traveller bent on the enjoyment of the wonders of a 
new land is swallowed up in the student intent on understanding the monuments of a marvellous antiquity. But 
after this first visit all traces of the traveller disappear, and the serious laborious student becomes everything. 
Once again in after years did Lane ascend the Nile as far as Thebes, and live the old life in his tomb; but it was 
to avoid the Plague, and his visit there was still devoted to study. Henceforward we shall see, not the 
enterprising and often daring explorer, climbing flat-faced cliffs, swinging down a mummy-pit, crawling in the 
low passages of tombs and pyramids, but a scholar at his desk, a learned man honoured in learned circles, the 
highest authority on matters Arabian to whom England or Europe could appeal. 



1828—1835- 

THE SECOND VISIT TO EGYPT (1833-5.) 


For some time after his return to England, Lane was occupied in working his Egyptian notes and diaries 
into the form that the manuscript of the "Description of Egypt" now wears. It has already been said that the 
negotiations with the publishers for the production of the book fell to the ground. But before this happened, 
Lane had separated from the body of the work his account of the modern inhabitants of Egypt, which it was 
thought would appear to greater advantage and be more widely read as a distinct book. This part of the 
"Description" was shown to Lord Brougham, who at once recognised its high merit, and recommended it to the 
Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, of which he was a Member of Committee. It was in consequence 
of the acceptance of the work by the Society that Lane determined to visit Egypt again, in order to enlarge and 
perfect his account of the people. This is an instance of that thoroughness which is shown in every work of his. 
Whatever came to his hand to do, he did it with all his might. He would never condescend to anything 
approaching slovenly work; and thought little of crossing the Mediterranean and staying two years at Cairo in 
order to bring nearer to perfection a sketch of the manners and customs of the inhabitants of Egypt, which to 
an ordinary writer would have seemed to stand in need of no revision. Without hesitation he went over the 
whole ground again, verified each statement, and added much that had been omitted from the earlier and more 
concise work. During the two years he spent in the Egyptian metropolis, scarcely a day passed without his 
going out among his Muslim friends and accustoming himself more completely to their manners, or witnessing 
the various public festivals of the year. Every day's experience was carefully recorded in a little library of note- 
books, all written in his singularly clear and neat hand, except where here and there an Egyptian friend has 
scribbled his own statement in Arabic. One of these note-books appears to have been kept for recording the 
more important scenes that Lane witnessed, and is fortunately dated, so as to form an intermittent diary. As 
this is this is the only journal he ever kept, to my knowledge, except a brief account of his first Nile-voyage, it is 
here reproduced. Besides the necessary suppression of a few passages relating to family matters, certain long 
passages have been omitted, since they occur verbatim in Lane's published works. It is not often that the pages 
of a diary can be transferred to a finished book like "The Modern Egyptians" without even verbal alteration. But 
it was the same with everything Lane wrote. If he was asked a question by letter, his answer was always fit for 
publication, both in style and in accuracy of matter. 


London, 25th Oct., 1833.— Engaged my passage to Alexandria 
on board the merchant brig Rapid, Capt. Phillips, 162 tons, for 30 
guineas, to be found with all necessary stores, poultry, &c. — 6th 
Nov. Embarked at St. Katharine's Dock.— 7th. Sailed. — 25th. 
Passed Gibraltar.— 5th Dec. Passed Malta.— 13th (1st of Shaaban, 
1249). Arrived at Alexandria. 

It had rained almost incessantly, and very heavily, during the 
three nights previous to our arrival at Alexandria; and the streets 
were consequently in a most filthy state. The general appearance of 
the people was also far more miserable than when I was here 
before. The muddy state of the streets doubtless confined most 


well-dressed persons to their houses; but it is rather to the severe 
oppression of late years, and to repeated conscriptions, which have 
deprived many parents of the support they received from the 
labour of their sons, that I attribute the difference which I 
remarked in the general aspect of the population of this place. A 
few days before my arrival, some persons from Constantinople had 
brought the plague there. They were put into quarantine; and the 
disease had thus been confined within the Lazarette, which was 
surrounded by a cordon of soldiers. There had been 87 cases, and 
23 deaths.— I dined and slept at Mr. Harris's country-house, which 
is in an angle of the garden in which the house that resided in is

situated, where I stayed during my first visit to Alexandria. A part 
of this garden is converted into a burial-place for the Englsh. Mr. 
Salt is buried there.— Alexandria is rapidly increasing towards the 
site of the old city: several large and handsome buildings have 
lately been erected in that quarter. 

14th. Removed my luggage from the brig to a boat on the 
Mahmoodeeyeh; and in the afternoon set sail for the Nile. Paid 45 
piasters for the voyage to the Nile.— 15th. Arrived before sunrise at 
the Foom, or the mouth of the canal, where it communicates with 
the Nile. A bridge with gates has lately been constructed across the 
mouth, to retain the water in the canal during the season of low 
Nile. -I here had to engage another boat, on the Nile. Bargained for 
80 piasters for the voyage to Masr (or Cairo). Proceeded to 
Fooweh; but could not continue our voyage in consequence of a 
violent contrary wind. The air was very thick; and I could hardly 
fancy myself in Egypt. The river still very turbid. There were many 
boats here conveying Turkish pilgrims on their way to join the 
Egyptian Caravan to Mekkeh. Fooweh seems to be falling to utter 
ruin and to be inhabited by the most squalid miserable people I 
ever beheld. I am told that I shall remark the same at all the 
villages we have to pass; and the reason is this:— all the best- 
looking young men have been picked for the army or navy, and 
their wives and lovers have mostly followed them; but being parted 
from them on their arrival at the metropolis have there betaken 
themselves to prostitution; and Masr now absolutely swarms with 
prostitutes. Thus the villages have been half desolated; and seem 
to be peopled in general with the most wretched, ugly, old, and 
haggard paupers. I see scarcely one good-looking young woman 
among a hundred; or scarcely one where I used to see a score; and 
almost all are in rags.— 16th. In the afternoon, though the wind was 
still very high and from the S.W., we proceeded. Stopped for the 
night under the west bank, a little below Shubra Kheet. Several 
heavy showers of rain fell, accompanied with violent gusts of wind, 
which obliged many boats, loaded with Turkish pilgrims, to stop at 
the same part. From a boat next above ours, during a shower of 
rain, there poured forth a number of these pilgrims, each with his 
ewer in his hand, to perform the ablution preparatory to prayer; 
and some of them aged and decrepit. While meditating on their 
zeal and the hardships which awaited them and admiring their 
grave and venerable aspect, I was surprised to see six of them, and 
among these some of the most aged, run to a taboot (a kind of 
water-wheel used for irrigation), and, with shouts such as their 
children would have used on a similar occasion, amuse themselves 
by exerting what little strength they had to perform, all the six 
together, the work of one cow; and turn, which they could only do 
very slowly, the stiff and creaking wheel. A few minutes after, they 
performed their devotions, all of them together, with the utmost 
solemnity and decorum, ranged in ranks, four abreast, under the 
partial shelter of some durah about 12 feet high: one acted as 
Imam, in the first rank; and having previously chanted the adan, 
recited the prayers, chanting the fard-prayers in a high key and 
loud voice.— To-day I began to feel the effect which is often 
produced by first drinking the water of the Nile, and by the cool air 
of the night; my cabin being only furnished with blinds, like those 
of an English carriage, to the windows, I was much exposed to the 
night-air.— 17th. Advanced to Shubra Kheet. The weather being 
boisterous and rainy, and my reiyis determined to proceed, I made 
a new agreement with him; to pay 20 piaster a day, and to stop 


when and where I desired. Accordingly I remained the rest of this 
day, and the following night, at Shubra Kheet.— 18th. Of the 
prudence of the new arrangement which I had made for my boat I 
received a strong proof in information brought me to-day that a 
boat which I had first hired at the Foom, about the same size and 
on the same terms as that in which I now am, but afterwards left 
for the latter boat in consequence of an order that vessels there 
should take their departure according to the order in which they 
lay, had been capsized in the night: the crew and passengers were 
saved, but remained shivering in their wet clothes for many hours; 
no village being near. Had this been my case, in my present 
indisposed state, I should probably have lost my life; or, if not, my 
books &c. would have been lost or spoiled. My informant thanked 
God for my preservation; and I most heartily joined him. —19th. 
Proceeded to Shaboor: the wind still very violent and contrary: on 
the 20th, to Nadir; 21st, to Zawiyet Razeem, by the tow-rope; 
having scarcely a breath of wind.— 22nd. Calm. Proceeded, by 
towing, to Wardan.— 23rd and 24th. As the wind was violent and 
contrary during the greater part of each of these days, my reiyis 
absented himself from the boat. I punish him by deducting two 
days' pay.— 25th. Arrived within five miles of Boolak. 26th. Arrived 
at Boolak about noon. Sent for a janisary from the Consulate to 
pass my luggage at the custom-house, and rode up to my old friend 
’Osman, who had made preparations for my reception in a house 
belonging to him and next to that in which he resides. This house I 
have engaged for the period of my intended stay in Masr. It is 
situated in the most healthy part of the town, near the N.W. angle; 
and to me, who have suffered from ophthalmia, it is a desirable 
residence, as it has glass windows. I have no doubt that ophthalmia 
in this country is generally the effect of suppressed perspiration, 
which is most commonly induced by the night-air (the windows of 
almost all the houses in Masr and the other towns being merely of 
wooden lattice-work) ; and that it is aggravated by the habit of 
keeping the head too warm, and the feet too cool. 

The aspect of Masr, as seen in the approach from the port, 
has been much improved since the period of my last visit by the 
removal of many of the mounds of rubbish which rose along that 
side, and by most of the space which these unsightly objects 
occupied being converted into gardens. A short time ago, European 
travellers, if habited in the Turkish or Egyptian dress, were not 
allowed to enter the gates of Masr without a passport (called 
tezkereh), which was shown to the guard. This custom is now 
dispensed with. It was adopted in order to ascertain the number of 
the population; and to insure that no one of the natives might be 
unknown, and so escape paying the firdeh or poll-tax. In the 
interior of the metropolis I observe more ruined houses than when 
I was last here; and in the appearance of the lower orders, more 
wretchedness. No change has taken place in the style of the 
costume of the natives; but the military officers, and the Turks in 
the employ of the Basha, have adopted the Nizamee dress, which 
was becoming common among them before I last quitted Masr. 
The head-dress (being merely a tarboosh, without the muslin or 
Kishmeeree shawl wound round it) has lost its elegance; and the 
whole dress is less becoming and graceful than the Memlook 
costume which it has superseded; though it is more convenient for 
walking and any active exertion. Formerly, a grandee of Masr, with 
his retinue of twenty or more well-mounted men, clad in habits of 
various and brilliant hues, and with splendid accoutre- 



ments, the saddles covered with embroidered velvet and plates of gilt 
and embossed silver, and the bridles, headstalls, and other trappings 
ornamented in a similar manner and with rows of gold coins 
suspended to them, presented a' strikingly picturesque and pompous 
spectacle. Sights of this description are no longer witnessed in the 
Egyptian metropolis. Even the Basha, when he occasionally rides 
through the streets, is followed by only three or four attendants, and is 
not more distinguished by the habits than by the number of his 
retinue. As dark colours, and particularly black, are now fashionable 
among the Turks, and their dresses are generally embroidered with 
silk, instead of gold lace, there is much less contrast and variety 
observable in the costumes of the passengers in the crowded streets; 
but at present there is a little more variety and bustle than is usual, 
from the number of Turkish pilgrims resting here on their way to 
Mekkeh. 

My old acquaintance the sheykh Ahmad (or seyd Ahmad, for he 
is a shereef) called on me as soon as he had heard of my arrival. He has 
resumed his old habit of visiting me almost every day; both for the 
sake of getting his dinner or supper, or at least tobacco and coffee, and 
to profit in his trade of bookseller. I wish I could make a portrait which 
would do justice to his singular physiognomy. For many years he has 
been nearly blind: one of his eyes is quite closed: the other is 
ornamented on particular occasions, as the two great festivals, &c., 
with a border of kohl; though he is a shocking sloven at all times. He 
tells me that he has taken a second wife, and a second house for her; 
but that he is as poor as ever; and that my usual yearly present of a 
dress will be very acceptable He has a talent for intrigue and cheating, 
which he exercises on every opportunity; being lax in morals, and 
rather so in his religious tenets. Notwithstanding these defects, and 
sometimes in consequence of his having the latter defect, I find him 
very useful. Much of the information that I have obtained respecting 
the manners and customs of his countrymen has been derived from 
him, or through his assistance; as he scruples not to be communicative 
to me on subjects respecting which a bigoted Muslim would be silent. 
He has just brought me a mushaf (or copy of the Kur-an), which he 
wishes me to purchase; but he thinks it necessary, as he did on former 
similar occasions, to offer some excuse for his doing so. He remarks 
that by my following or conforming with many of the ceremonies of the 
Muslims I tacitly profess myself to be one of them; and it is incumbent 
on him to regard me in the most favourable light. "You give me," says 
he, "the salutation of 'Peace be on you!' and it would be impious in me, 
and directly forbidden by my religion, to pronounce you an unbeliever; 
for He whose name be exalted hath said in the Excellent Book,—' Say 
not unto him who greeteth thee with peace, Thou art not a believer’ 
(ch. iv., v. 96)— therefore," he adds, "it is no sin in me to put into your 
hands the noble Kur-an: but there are some of your countrymen who 
will take it in unclean hands, and even put it under them and sit upon 
it ! I beg God's forgiveness for talking of such a thing: far be it from you 
to do so: you, praise be to God, know and observe the command 'None 
shall touch it but those who are clean."' (ch. lvi., v. 78: these words are 
often stamped upon the 'cover.) He once sold a mushaf on my 
application to a countryman of mine, who, being disturbed just as the 
bargain was concluded by some person entering the room, hastily put 


* Here follows the story of Sheykh Ahmad's mother, told in the pre- 
face to The Modern Egyptians, p. xviii, (5th Ed.) 


the sacred book on the deewan and under a part of his dress, to conceal 
it: the bookseller was much scandalized by this action; thinking that 
my friend was sitting upon the book, and doing so to show his 
contempt of it. There was only one thing that I had much difficulty in 
persuading him to do, during my former visit to this country; which 
was to go with me to the mosque of the Hasaneyn, the burial-place of 
the head of the Prophet's grandson, El-Hoseyn, and the most soared of 
the mosques of Masr. On passing with him before one of the entrances 
of this building, one afternoon in Ramadan, when it was crowded with 
Turks, and many of the principal people of the metropolis were among 
the congregation, I thought it a good opportunity to see it to the 
greatest advantage, and asked my companion to go in with me. He 
positively refused, in the fear of my being discovered to be an 
Englishman, which might so rouse the fanatic anger of some of the 
Turks there as to expose me to some act of violence. I therefore entered 
alone. He remained at the door; following me with his eye only (or his 
only eye), and wondering at my audacity; but as soon as he saw me 
acquit myself in the usual manner, by walking round the bronze screen 
which surrounds the monument over the spot where the martyr's head 
is buried and then going through the regular attitudes of prayer, he 
came in and maid his prayers by-my side.— The principal subjects of 
the conversations which my other Masree acquaintances have held 
with me since my return to their country have been the oppression 
which they suffer under the present government, the monopolies of the 
Basha, and the consequent dulness of trade and dearness of 
provisions, &c. The sheykh Ahmad is less querulous: he praises the 
Basha for including booksellers among persons of literary and religious 
professions, from whom no firdeh is exacted. He and another 
bookseller, who is his superior, are agents for the sale of the books 
printed at the Basha's press, at Boolak. They have a shop in the 
principal street of the city (nearly opposite the entrance to Khan El- 
Khaleelee), which will be a convenient place for me to repair to on the 
occasions of public processions. 

Friday, 10th of January.— Last day (29th) of Sbaaban.— In the 
afternoon of this day I went to the booksellers' shop to see the 
procession of the Leylet er-Rooyeh, or Night of the Observation of the 
new moon of Ramadan, the month of abstinence. Soon after the 'asr, 
the shops were mostly shut, and the mastabahs were occupied by 
spectators, old and young. The foremost persons in the procession, a 
company of Nizam infantry, passed the place where I was sitting 
(within ten minutes' walk of the Kadee's house, whither they were 
destined) about an hour and a quarter before sunset, The whole 
procession consisted of nothing more than several companies of Nizam 
troops, each company preceded and followed by bearers of mesh'als, to 
light them on their return, together with small parties of members of 
those trades which furnish the metropolis with provisions: a group of 
millers following one party of soldiers; a group of bakers, another: 
after all of whom came the Mohbtesib, with attendants, The soldiers 
were accompanied by drummers and lifers, and one band. The 
members of trades who took part in the procession, with several 
fakeers, shouted as they passed along-" O ! Es-salah ! Es-salah ! Salloo 
’ala-n-Nabee ! ’aleyhi-s-selam !" (O ! Blessing ! Blessing ! Bless ye the 
Prophet ! On him be peace !). After every two or three companies there 
was an interval of many minutes: so that about an hour elapsed before 
the procession had passed the place where I sat. After waiting some 
time at the Kadee's, the information that the new moon had been seen 
was brought there; and the soldiers and other persons who had formed

the procession thither divided themselves into several companies, and 
perambulated different quarters of the town; shouting Ya' ummata 
kheyri-l-ana'm ! Siya'm ! Siya'm ! (O followers of the best of the 
creation ! Fasting ! Fasting !). The mosques were all illuminated 
within; and lamps hung at their entrances, and upon the galleries of 
the mad’nehs. —When the moon is not seen, the people are informed 
by the cry of Ghada min shahri Shaaba'n ! Fitar ! Fitar ! (To-morrow 
is of the month of Shaaban I No fasting ! No fasting !).— The people 
seem as merry to-night as they usually do when released from the 
miseries of the day's fast.* 

11th of January.— 1st of Ramadan.— Instead of seeing, as at other 
times, most of the passengers in the streets with the pipe in the hand, 
we now see them empty-handed, or carrying a stick or cane; but some 
of the Christians are not afraid, as they used to be, of smoking in their 
shops during this month. The streets in the morning have a dull 
appearance, many of the shops being shut; but in the afternoon they 
are as much crowded as usual, and all the shops are open. A similar 
difference is also observable in the manners and temper of the people 
during the day-time and at night: while fasting, they are generally 
speaking very morose: in the evening after breakfast, they are 
unusually affable and cheerful. As Ramadan now falls in the winter, the 
fast is comparatively easy; the days being short, and the weather cool: 
therefore thirst is not felt so severely. The period from the 
commencement of the fast (the imsak), which is at this season within 
two hours of sunrise, to the time when it ends, or sunset, is now (in the 
beginning of the month) 12 hours and 12 minutes: at the end of the 
month it will be 12 hours and 47 minutes. Servants who are fasting (as 
mine, and most others, are), if they have to bring a pipe to a person 
who is not keeping the fast, will not draw the smoke as usual at other 
times, but put a live coal upon the tobaccoo, and blow upon it, or wave 
the pipe through the air; and then present it. I take my principal meal 
now at sunset, in order that it may serve as a breakfast to any friend 
who may call on me in the evening, at or before that time. Towards 
evening, and for some time after sunset, the beggars in the streets are 
now more than usually importunate and clamorous. I often hear the 
cries of Fatooree ’aleyk ya ' Rabb ! (My breakfast must be thy gift, O 
Lord \)—Ana deyf Allah wa-n-Nebee (I am the guest of God and the 
Prophet !)— and the following, which exhibit a union (not uncommon 
in similar cries) of the literary and popular dialects of Arabio— Men 
f attar sa'im luh agrun da'im (Who gives breakfast to a faster will have 
an enduring recompense). The coffee-shops are now much frequented 
by persons of the lower orders; many of whom prefer to break their 
fast with a cup of coffee and a pipe. Parties assemble at these shops a 
little before sunset, and wait there to hear the evening call to prayer, 
which announces the termination of the day's fast. Some of the coffee- 
shops offer the attraction of a reciter of tales, or poetical romance, 
during the nights of Ramadan. It is also a custom among some of the 
'Ulama of Masr to have a Zikr performed in their houses, by a 
numerous company of fakeers, every night during this month.t My 
almost daily visiter, the sheykh Ahmad, the bookseller, tells me that he 
cannot spend much time with me this month; as he sleeps half the day, 
and breakfasts, and takes part in a Zikr, every evening, at the house of 
the late sheykh El-’Aroosee, who was one of the four great sheykhs of 


* Cp. Mod. Eg. p. 472. t Cp. Mod. Eg. pp. 474—6 


Masr, presiding over the Hanafeeyeh, of whom he was also the 
muftee.— As I was sitting at the booksellers’ shop to-day, the Basha, 
Mohammad 'Alee, rode by, on his way to say the afternoon prayers in 
the mosque of the Hasaneyn, followed by only four attendants; the first 
of whom bore his seggadeh (or prayer carpet), in an embroidered 
kerchief, on his lap. The Basha was very plainly dressed, with a white 
turban. I should not have known him, had I not been informed that it 
was he; for he appears much older than when I was last in Egypt; 
though he looks remarkably well. He saluted the people right and left 
as he passed along: all rising to him. -It is the general fashion of the 
principal Turks in Masr, and of many of their countrymen, to repair to 
the mosque of the Hasaneyn in the afternoon during Ramadan, to pray 
and lounge; and on these occasions, a number of Turkish tradesmen 
(called Tohafgeeyeh, or Tohafjeeyeh) expose for sale, in the court of 
the meyda-ah (or tank for ablution) of this mosque, a variety of articles 
of taste and luxury suited to the wants of their countrymen; such as 
porcelain, glass, gold, silver, brass, and copper' wares; cutlery; mouth- 
pieces of pipes and pipe-sticks; and many other commodities, chiefly 
from Constantinople, or other places in Europe. The interior of the 
Hasaneyn during the afternoon in Ramadan is one of the most 
interesting sights in Masr; but from the circumstances which render it 
so, and particularly from its being the most sacred of all the mosques 
in Masr, none but a Muslim can enter and witness the scene which it 
presents, unless accompanied by an officer of the government, without 
imminent risk of being discovered, violently turned out, insulted with 
scurrilous language, and perhaps beaten or spit upon. I only once 
ventured into this mosque on such an occasion; and then was careful 
to perform all the usual ceremonies. Many persons go to the mosque of 
the Hasaneyn to offer up their petitions for particular blessings, in the 
belief that the sanctity of the place will ensure the success of their 
prayers. 

A man was beheaded to-day, for stealing several pipes and 
drinking-cups, belonging to the Basha, in the Citadel. 

Feb. 9th.-Last day (30th) of Ramadan.— Ramadan has passed 
away with scarcely any incident to relieve its dulness, excepting the 
usual merry-making of the lower orders of the people at night in the 
coffee-shops, where smoking tobacco or hemp, playing at some kind of 
game, or listening to a story-teller, were their ordinary amusements. I 
have not observed funerals to be more numerous than usual during the 
latter part of the month, as is the case when Ramadan falls in the 
warmer seasons; but the people have not seemed less out of humour 
with the fast. Weariness and moroseness are the predominant effects 
of the observance of Ramadan; and if people are seen at this time more 
than usually occupied in mumbling portions of the Kur-an, I think 
their motive is rather to pass away the time than anything else. I am 
told that many more persons break the fast now than did when I was 
last here. Even the Kadee told an acquaintance of mine, a few days ago, 
that it was his custom only to keep the first two and last two days of the 
fast. By the poor, in general, it is still rigidly kept; and, by them, most 
severely felt, as they can seldom relax from their ordinary labours. 
There is now living in this city an old man who fasts every day in the 
year, from day-break to sunset, excepting on the occasions of the two 
'Eeds (or festivals), when it is unlawful for the Muslim to fast. At night 
he eats very sparingly. He keeps a shop in the shoe-market called 
Kasabat Rudwan, where he is generally seen occupied in reciting the 
Kur-an and handling his beads. It is said that there are several other 
persons here who fast in the same austere manner. — The weather 



MEMOIR. 


XVIII 


during the month which is just expiring has been of an unusual kind: 
several very heavy showers of rain have fallen; and the streets have 
seldom been dry more than two or three days together. 

In the afternoon of this day (at the hour of the ’asr) the guns of 
the Citadel announced the termination of the period of the fast: the 
new moon having been seen. The fast is, however, kept till sunset. In 
the evening, the guns fired again. With sunset, the Eed commences. 
The people are all rejoicing: swings and whirligigs are erected in many 
parts of the town, and in its environs; and several story-tellers and 
reciters of poetry have collected audiences in various places. 

loth.— First day of the ’Eed .— At day-break, all the mosques were 
crowded with worshippers, to perform the prayers of the ’Eed; and 
now, every minute, friends are seen in the streets congratulating, 
embracing, and kissing, each other. Many of the people (all who can 
afford) are seen in complete new suits of clothes: others, with a new 
’eree, or tarboosh and turban, or, at least, a new pair of red or yellow 
shoes. Most of the shops are shut, excepting those where eatables are 
sold. The people are mostly occupied in visits of congratulation; or 
repairing, particularly the women, to the tombs of their relatives. 
Donkeys laden with palm-branches, for the visiters of the tombs, 
obstruct the streets in many places. The guns of the Citadel are fired at 
noon and in the afternoon (at the ’asr) on each of the three days of the 
’Eed. 

12th.— Last day of the ’Eed.— This day I accompanied my 
neighbour ’Osman to visit the tomb of the sheykh Ibraheem 
(Burckhardt), in the cemetery of Bab en-Nasr, on the north of the city, 
to see that the monument was in good repair, and to pay to the 
memory of the lamented traveller that tribute of respect which is 
customary on the occasion of the ’Eed. The principal part of the burial- 
ground, directly opposite the Bab en-Nasr, was occupied by dense 
crowds of persons who had collected there for their amusement, and 
presented a most singular scene. Vast numbers of tents were erected; 
some, for the reception of idlers; but most, for the visiters of the 
tombs; many of whom, conspicuous by their palm-branches, were, like 
ourselves, making their way with much difficulty through the 
multitude. A woman who had fallen down here on the first day of the 
’Eed was trodden to death. Being mounted on donkeys, we got on 
better than some others; but our palm-branch, borne before us, and 
showing our pious intention, had not the effect of inducing any one to 
move out of our way. A large space was occupied by swings and 
whirligigs, all in rapid motion, and loaded with boys and girls: the 
principal objects of attraction to persons of maturer age were 
conjurors, musicians, dancing-girls, and dancing-men. Having passed 
through the most crowded part of the cemetery, we soon arrived at the 
tomb of the sheykh Ibraheem. It is a plain and humble monument of 
the usual oblong form, constructed of the common coarse, calcareous 
stone of the neighbouring mountain-range of Mukattam, with a stela 
of the same stone, roughly cut, and without any inscription, at the head 
and foot. Numerous fakeers resort to the cemeteries during the three 
days of the ’Eed, to perform, for the remuneration of a piaster or two, 
the service usual on those occasions when visiters arrive; consisting of 
the recital of, at least, one of the longer chapters of the Kur-an, and 
afterwards of the Fat’hah, which latter the yisiters recite with him. One 
of them was employed to perform this service by my friend. He did it 
very rapidly, and without much reverence, seated at the foot of the 
tomb. This being finished, and the palm, branch broken in pieces and 
laid on the tomb, a fee was given to the guardian of the tombs, and we 


returned.— ’Osman performed the pilgrimage in company with the 
sheykh Ibraheem. He presented me a few day ago with the certificate 
of Ibraheem's pilgrimage. It is a paper of the size of a small quarto leaf: 
the greater part occupied by a representation of the temple of Mekkeh, 
drawn with ink, and ornamented with red, yellow, and green, and with 
silver leaf: beneath which picture is written the document of which the 
following is a copy.-" Praise be to God, who hath made the pilgrimage 
to be rightly accomplished, and the intention rewarded, and sin 
forgiven. To proceed.— The respected hagg Ibraheem hath performed 
the pilgrimage, according to the divine ordinances, and accomplished 
all the incumbent ordinances of the Prophet, completely and perfectly. 
And God is the best of witnesses. The halt was on the 9th day of the 
month of El-Heggeh, in the year 1229." 

15th.— Witnessed the procession of the Kisweh, which I have 
described in one of my note-books.* 

17th.— The Magician ’Abd El-Kadir came to me. His 
performances unsuccessful. 

18th.— A man was beheaded yesterday; and another to-day. One 
was for entering a house to rob, and for attempting to murder the 
owner. He locked the latter in one of the rooms, and then proceeded to 
rifle the house. On descending, he saw the owner at a window, calling 
for assistance; and fired a pistol at him.— The crime of the other, who 
was a Turk, a kowwas of the Basha was robbing and murdering a 
Turkish pilgrim. He arrested the pilgrim on the canal of Alexandria, 
under pretence of his being required to answer some charge preferred 
against him before Moharram Bey, the Governor of Alexandria. After 
conducting him some little distance towards Alexandria, he murdered 
him, and threw his body into the pit of a sakiyeh. The companions of 
the unfortunate man, some days after, being surprised at hearing no 
tidings of him, applied to Moharram Bey; and finding that he knew 
nothing of the circumstance, searched for and apprehended the 
murderer.— Robberies have become very frequent here of late: crime, 
as might be expected, increasing with the oppression and misery of the 
people.— News arrived to-day of a number of Ahmad Basha's horses 
having been stolen, by a party of Bedawees, from the Feiyoom, where 
they had been sent for the clover season. 

20 th.— The Magician came again, in the evening. His 
performances I have described in one of my note-books. + 

27th. —Went to the Hasaneyn, to see the Kisweh, the Burko', &c., 
previously to their being packed up and dispatched with the caravan to 
Mekkeh. .The sewing of the Kisweh was not quite completed: several 
men and women were at work upon it in the great hall, or portico. I 
asked for, and obtained, for a trifling present, a piece of the Kisweh, a 
span in length, and nearly the same in breadth. In sewing the several 
breadth together, it is necessary to cut off some small strips; and these 
are sold, or given, to persons who apply for them; being considered as 
amulets. In the saloon of the tomb, I found several pious visiters; and, 
among them, a poor man, standing before the bronze screen which 
surrounds the monument, and praying aloud, with uplifted hands, for 
food; saying-" Bread, o Lord ! I pray for bread: I do not ask for dates: I 
only pray for bread."— After I had recited the Fat’hah, according to 
custom, at the shrine of Hoseyn, I went to a small apartment adjoining 
the mosque, in which were placed the Burko’, the covering for the 
Makam Seydna Ibraheem, the covering of the Mahmal (which were 


* Cp. Mod. Eg. p. 480. * Cp. Mod. Eg. pp. 268, 



MEMOIR. 


XIX 


partly unfolded for me to see), the Hegab (or Mushaf ), of the Mahmal, 
and the embroidered green silk bag in which is kept the key of the 
Kaabeh. As soon as I had gratifed my curiosity by inspecting these 
sacred objects, and again recited the Fat'hah, by desire of the persons 
who showed them to me, and who did the same, I was overwhelmed 
with applications for presents by about a dozen ministers and inferior 
servants of the mosque. Three or four piasters satisfied them; or at 
least silenced them.— On my way to the Hasaneyn, I passed through 
the great mosque El-Azhar. I was obliged to send my servant by 
another way because he was carrying my pipe, which could not with 
propriety be taken into the mosque, though several persons were 
carrying about bread and other eatables in the great court and in the 
place of prayer, for sale to the mugawireen (or students) and the other 
numerous frequenters of this great temple and university. The weather 
being not warm, the court was crowded with groups of students and 
idlers, lounging or basking in the sun; and part of it was occupied by 
schoolmasters with their young pupils. The interior of this mosque 
always presents a very interesting scene, at least to me, from its being 
the principal centre of attraction to the votaries of religion, of 
literature, and of other sciences, throughout the Muslim world. The 
college has just been disgraced by one of its members having been 
convicted of a robbery; and this morning several of the learned 
community, having heard that eight men were just about to be hanged, 
were in a state of alarm lest their guilty associate should be one of that 
number. A brother of this culprit was pointed out to me, conversing, 
with apparent apathy, with another person, who, turning to me, asked 
me if I knew of any case on record of a member of the 'Ulama being 
hanged.— Shortly after I had quitted the Hasaneyn, the eight men 
above-mentioned were hanged; each in a different part of the town. 
The member of the college was not among them. In crossing the 
principal street of the city, I saw one of them, hanging at the window of 
a sebeel, or public fountain. He was a soldier. His crime was robbery 
and murder. Another of the eight was hanged for a simnilar crime. He 
entered the house of a rich Jewess, ostensibly for the purpose of taking 
away the dust; murdered her, by cutting off her head; put her remains 
into a large zeer (or water-jar), and 'having thrown some dust in the 
mouth of the jar, carried it away; but it was broken at the bottom, and 
some blood dripping from it attracted the notice of passengers in the 
street, and caused his apprehension. Some jewels which had belonged 
to the murdered woman were found upon his person. 

3rd of March.— 22nd of Showwal.— Saw the procession of the 
Mahmal. It differed from the last which I saw, seven years ago (in 
1827), in being attended with less pomp. First, about two hours and a 
half after sunrise, a small field-piece (for firing the signals for 
departure after the halts) was drawn along. This was followed by a 
company of Baltageeyeh (or Pioneers), and the Basha's guards, with 
their band at their head. Then came a train of several camels with large 
stuffed saddles, upon the forepart of which were fixed two small flags, 
slanting forwards, and a small plume of ostrich-feathers upon the top 
of a small stick placed upright. These camels were dyed red, with 
henna; and had housings ornamented with small hells (cowries): some 
were decorated with palm-branches, fixed upright upon the saddle: 
some had a large bell hung on each aide; and some bore a pair of the 
large kettle-drums called nakakeer, with the man who beat them. The 
takht’rativa'n of the Emeer El-Hagg (or Chief of the Pilgrims) followed 
next, borne by two camels. Then came numerous groups of 
darweeshes, with the banner of their several orders (flags, poles, nets, 


&c.): some of them repeating the name of God, and nodding their 
heads; and some beating, with a leather strap, a small kettle-drum, 
which they held in the left hand. Among these groups were two 
swordsmen, who repeatedly engaged each other in a mock combat; two 
wrestlers, naked to the waist, and smeared with oil; and the fantastical 
figure described in my account of the procession of the Kisweh,* 
mounted on a horse, and clad in sheep-skins, with a high skin cap, and 
a false beard. The darweeshes were followed by the Mahmal; which has 
but a poor appearance this year; the covering being old, and its 
embroidery tarnished. The people crowded to touch it with their 
hands, or with the end of a shawl; several persons unwinding their 
turbans, and women at the windows taking off their head-veils, for this 
purpose. I had been freely allowed to examine and handle it when it 
was deposited in the mosque of the Hasaneyn. The half-naked sheykh 
whom I have mentioned in my account of the procession of the 
Kisweh, and in that of the former procession of the Mahmal, followed 
the sacred banner, as usual, mounted on a camel, and rolling his head. 
Some soldiers, with the Emeer el-Hagg and other officers who 
accompany the caravan, closed the procession. In less than an hour, 
the whole procession had passed the place where I sat. 

Many of the shop-keepers in the principal sooks (or bazars) are 
painting their shops in a rude kind of European style, decorating the 
shutters, &c., with flowers and other ornamental devices, painted on a 
light blue ground. The appearance of these streets may now be 
compared to that of an old Oriental garment, remarkable for the 
peculiarity of its form and work, patched over with pieces of European 
printed calico. I am sorry to observe that Masr is not only falling to 
decay, but that it is rapidly losing that uniform and unique style of 
architecture which has so long characterized it. Most of the new houses 
of the grandees and even of persons of moderate wealth, are built in 
the style of Constantinople; with shelving roofs and glass windows.— 
One of my friends here remarked to me that the painting the shops 
blue was sign of some heavy calamity being about to befal the city: blue 
(but really of a very dark shade) being the colour of mourning. 
Another observed that these shops resembled the person who 
recommended their decoration (the Basha); being fair without, but 
mean and dirty within. 

There has been much talk here for some weeks past (ever since 
my arrival) of a project which the Basha is about to put in execution, 
and which was at first said to be nothing less than the obstruction of 
the river by a dam to be thrown across it a few miles below the 
metropolis, in order to throw the whole tide of the river into the canals, 
and so to irrigate Lower Egypt more effectually: but latterly the real 
intention of the Basha has become better known. The two branches of 
the Nile which enclose the Delta are to flow under two bridges, to be 
constructed a little below the point where the river divides, each in the 
neck of a peninsula formed by a bend of the river; across which neck or 
isthmus a new bed for the water is to be made as soon as the bridge is 
completed; after which the old bed surrounding the peninsula is. to be 
filled up. These two bridges are to be connected with each other, and 
with Es-Suweys (or Suez) on 'the one side and Alexandria on the other, 
by a rail-road. The difficulty of the undertaking is immense; for these 
bridges are to withstand the tremendous tide of the inundation, and 
occasionally to be closed by flood-gates, so as to increase the height of

the river above sufficiently to cause it to fill all the small canals by 
which the Delta and the adjacent provinces are irrigated. A similar 
undertaking was projected by Bonaparte, when here. 

18th April.— 9th Zu-l-Heggeh.— This is the Day of the Pilgrimage; 
that is to say, of the six-hours' journey from Mekkeh to Mount 'Arafat, 
which gives to each person who performs it the title of Pilgrim, and 
without the performance of which he would not obtain that title even if 
he had journeyed to Mekkeh from the most remote part of the Muslim 
world. The halt upon Mount 'Arafat happening this year on a Friday, 
the Sabbath of the Muslims, has made several of my friends express 
great regret that they have been unable to perform the pilgrimage 
under such a propitious circumstance. 

19th.— The 'Eed el-Kebeer.— Nothing unusual to remark upon. 

May 25th.— We were somewhat alarmed to-day, about an hour 
after noon, by a shock of an earthquake. I was three times, with less 
than a moment's intervention, rather violently shaken on my seat; and 
several long cracks were opened in the walls of the house in which I am 
living. I have heard of no house having been thrown down or much 
injured by it. It is supposed to have shown its greatest violence (that is, 
to have originated) in Syria. 

June 7th.— During the week which is now closing all classes of 
courtesans, including the ghawazze (or public dancing-girls), have 
been suppressed in the metropolis and its neighbourhood. This 
measure has been talked of, as about to be put in execution, for some 
months past. The courtesans had become extremely numerous, and 
were scattered in every quarter of the town; some of them living in 
houses almost fit to be the residences of grandees; and acquiring 
considerable wealth. 

July 29th.— Went to the Pyramids of El-Geezeh. Stayed in 
"Caviglia's Tomb." 

30th.— We again experienced a shock of an earthquake, more 
violent than the former, at about half-past nine P.M. Heard of no 
injury done. 

Aug. 2nd.— Returned from the Pyramids. 

5th.— The dam of the Canal of Masr cut. I have given an account 
of this in another note-book.* 

12th.— Last night, Seleem Bey, a general in the Basha's service, 
hired a large party of fikees, to perform a recital of the Kur-an, in his 
house in this city; and then went up into his hareem, and strangled his 
wife. He had written to Ibraheem Basha, accusing this woman (who 
was the daughter of a Turk in high office) of incontinence; and asking 
his permission to punish her. He received for answer, that he might do 
as he pleased. He then sent Ibraheem Basha's letter to Mohammad 
'Alee, asking the same permission of the latter; and received the same 
answer. The case presents a sufficient proof of Mohammad 'Alee's 
ideas of justice and humanity. Had he wished to indulge his creature 
with permission to exercise the utmost severity of the law, he could 
only have said-" If you can produce four witnesses against your wife, or 
if you can swear that you have witnessed her crime by the oath 
ordained in cases of this kind, and she will not take the same oath that, 
the accusation is false, let her be stoned to death." 

Sept. 17th.— My 33rd birth-day. I have completed, as far as I can 
see, my notes on the manners and customs of the Muslims of Egypt. I 
have only to look over them; and to ask a few questions respecting the 
Copts.* 


* Cp. Mod. Eq. pp. 493—8. 


Oct. 27th.— I generally pay a visit to the shop of the Basha's 
booksellers on the mornings of Monday and Thursday, when auction- 
markets are held in the street where the shop is situated, and in the 
neighbouring bazar of Khan El-Khaleelee (the chief Turkish bazar) 
which occasion the street above-mentioned to be much crowded, and 
to present an amusing scene: but I am often more amused with the 
persons who frequent the shop where I take my seat. When I went 
there to-day, I found there an old man who had been possessed of 
large property in land; but had been deprived of it by the Basha, and 
been compelled to become a member of the university, the great 

mosque El-Azhar. This man, the Hagg , is a celebrated character. 

He rendered great assistance, both by his wealth and by active service, 
to Mohammad 'Alee, in his contest with his predecessor, Khursheed 
Basha, when the latter was besieged in the Citadel. The greater part of 
his property was confiscated by the man he had thus served, through 
fear of his influence. He thus shared the fate of most of those who had 
rendered eminent services to Mohammad 'Alee; but he contrived to 
hide much of his wealth; and has since employed friends to trade with 
it privately on his account, so that he has still a large income; but the 
third part of his receipts he always gives to the poor. The elder of the 
two booksellers was relating his having just purchnsed a house. There 
lived next-door to him, he said, a fikee, a member of the Azhar, and of 
some repute; to whom 14 keerats (or 24th parts) of the house in which 
he (the fikee) lodged belonged: the other 10 keerats of this house 
belonged to a tailor. The bookseller's house was entered, from the roof, 
and plundered, three times, of wheat, butter, &e. The fikee was 
accused by the bookseller of having committed these thefts; and 
confessed that he had; urging, in palliation, that he had only taken his 
food. The bookseller caused him to be imprisoned in the Citadel; and, 
after he had been confined there many days, offered to procure his 
liberation if he would sell him the above-mentioned share of his house. 
This was done; it was sold for six and a half purses. The bookseller 
then wanted to procure the tailor's share; and proposed to him to 
repair or separate or sell: for the house was in a ruined state. The 
tailor, refusing to do either, was summoned to the Kadee's court, and 
compelled to sell his share; for which he demanded five purses. Having 
received this sum of money, he met, on his way home, a friend, whom 
he told what he had done. " You fool "—said his friend—" you might 
have asked ten purses, and it would have been given." The tailor threw 
down the purse in the middle of the street; kicked off his shoes; and for 
several minutes continued slapping his face, and crying out, like a 
woman,— "O my sorrow !" He then snatched up the purse, and ran 
home with it, crying in the same manner all the way; and leaving his 
friend to follow him with his shoes.— Soon after the bookseller had told 
this story, there joined us a Persian darweesh, whom I had often met 
there before, and a fat, merry-looking, red-faced man, loaded with 
ragged clothing, showing the edge of a curly head of hair below his 
turban, and carrying a long staff. Everybody at the shop, excepting 
myself, kissed his hand: he offered me his hand, and, after taking it, I 
kissed my own, and he did the same. I was informed that he was a 
celebrated saint. He took snuff; smoked from my pipe; and had a 
constant smile upon his countenance; though he seldom spoke: almost 
the only words he uttered were a warm commendation of an answer

which I gave to the Persian: on his (the Persian’s) asking me why I had 
not already departed from Masr as I had intended, I said that the 
servant of God was passive and not elective; and this sentiment, 
though common, seemed much to please the welee: he repeated it with 
emphasis. —There next joined us a man of a very respectable and 
intelligent appearance, applying for a copy of the sheykh Rifa’ah's visit 
to France, lately printed at Boolak. Asking what were the general 
contents of this book, a person present answered him, that the author 
relates his voyage from Alexandria to Marseilles; how he got drunk on 
board the ship, and was tied to the mast, and flogged; that he ate pork 
in the land of infidelity and obstinacy, and that it is a most excellent 
meat; how he was delighted with the French girls, and how superior 
they are in charms to the women of Egypt; and, having qualified 
himself, in every accomplishment, for an eminent place in Hell, 
returned to his native country. This was an ironical quizz on the 
sheykh Rifa’ah for his strict conscientious adherence to the precepts of 
El-Islam during his voyage and his residence in France. The applicant 
for this book had a cataract in each of his eyes. I advised him to seek 
relief from the French surgeon Clot Bey; but he said that he was afraid 
to go to the hospital; for he had heard that many patients there were 
killed and boiled, to make skeletons: he afterwards, however, on my 
assuring him that his fears were groundless, promised to go.— While I 
was talking with him, there began to pass by the shop a long funeral- 
train, consisting of numerous fikees, and many of the ’Ulama. On my 
asking whose funeral it was, I was answered, "The sheykh El- 
Menzelawee," sheykh of the Saadeeyeh darweeshes. I was surprised; 
having seen him a few days before in apparently good health. Presently 
I saw him walking in the procession. I asked again; and was answered 
as before. "Why," said I, "praise be to God, the sheykh is walking with 
you, in good health :" I was then told that the deceased was his wife. 
Some Saadeeyeh in the procession were performing a zikr as they 
passed along; repeating " Allah!" When the bier came in view, I heard 
the women who followed raising their zagha'reet, or cries of joy, 
instead of lamenting. The deceased was a famous saint. She was the 
sister of the late sheykh of the Saadeeyeh; and it is believed that her 
husband, the present sheykh, derived his miraculous powers from her. 
It is said that she prophesied yesterday the exact hour of her death this 
day. The women began to lament when the corpse left the house; and, 
as usual when this is done at the funeral of a saint, the bearers 
declared that they could not move it: as soon as the lamentations were 
changed to the cries of joy, the bearers pretended to find their work 
quite easy.* 

Nov. 6th.— To-day, as I was sitting at the booksellers’ shop, a 
reputed welee, whom I have often seen, came and seated himself by 
me, and began, in a series of abrupt sentences, to relate to me various 
matters respecting me, past, present, and to come. His name is the 
sheykh ’Alee el-Leysee. He is a poor man, supported by alms: tall and 
thin and very dark; about thirty years of age; and wears nothing, at 
present, but a blue shirt and a girdle, and a padded red cap. "O 
Efendee ! " he said, "thou hast been very anxious for some days. There 
is a grain of anxiety remaining in thee yet. Do not fear. There is a letter 
coming to thee by sea, that will bring thee good news. [He then told 
Lane that all his family were well except one, who was then suffering 
from an intermittent fever, which was proved afterwards to be true.] 


* Cp. notes to the Thondsand One Nights, 2nd ed., ii., p. 64 


I wanted to ask thee for something to-day; but I feared: I feared 

greatly. Thou must be invested with wilayeh" (i. e. be made a welee): 
"the welees love thee; and the Prophet loves thee. Thou must go to the 
sheykh Mustafa El-Munadee, and the sheykh El-Bahaee!" (These are 
two very celebrated welees). " Thou must be a welee." He then took my 
right hand, in the manner which is practiced on giving the covenant 
which admits a person a darweesh, and repeated the Fat'hah; after 
which he added, "I have admitted thee my darweesh." Having told me 
of several circumstances relating to me, some of which he had 
doubtless learned of persons acquainted with me, and which I could 
not deny, and some which time only will prove true or false, he 
ventured at a further prophecy and hazardous guessing; and certainly 
his guessing was wonderful; for he informed me of matters relating to 
my family which were perfectly true, matters of an unusual nature, 
with singular minuteness and truth; making no mistake as far as I yet 
know. He then added-" To night, please God, thou shalt see the 
Prophet (Mohammad) in thy sleep, and El-Khidr, and the seyd El- 
Bedawee. This is Regeb; and I wanted to ask of thee— but I feared-I 
wanted to ask of thee four piasters, to buy meat and bread and oil and 
radishes. Regeb ! Regeb ! I have great offices to do for thee to-night." 
Less than a shilling for all that he promised was little enough. I gave it 
him for the trouble he had taken; and he muttered many abrupt 
prayers for me.*— It is just a year, to-day, since I embarked in London 
for this country. 

7th.— I saw, in my sleep, neither Mohammad nor El-Khidr nor 
the seyd El-Bedawee; unless, like Nebuchadnezzar, I cannot remember 
my dreams. The welee, therefore, I fear, is a cheat. 

11th.— The Turkish pilgrims are beginning to arrive, in 
considerable numbers.— Four men were beheaded to-day, for repeated 
robberies and murders. 

18th.— Went to the Moolid of the Seyyideh Zeyneb; which I have 
described in note-book no. 3. + 

20th.— About a hundred boys, from about 11 to 14 years of age, 
were conducted by my house this evening, to be enlisted. The mothers 
of many of them followed, screaming, and with their heads, faces, 
breasts, and the fore part of their clothing, plastered with mud. 

22nd.— The government has given orders, which are being put in 
execution, to pull down the mastabahs and the sakeefehs, or coverings, 
of matting, in almost all the sooks, or bazrs, and most of the 
thoroughfare streets. The former are not to be rebuilt in the more 
narrow and more frequented streets, and in most other parts are only 
to be made about two spans Wide. The sakeefehs are not to be replaced 
unless constructed of wood. The reason for pulling down or altering 
the mastabahs is to afford more room for the passengers and 
particularly for the Basha’s carriages, and for carts which are to be 
employed to remove dust and rubbish. The appearance of the city is 
rapidly changing, and losing its Arabian aspect. 

24th.— The sheykh ’Alee told me to-day that I should not yet set 
out on my voyage home. In the evening news arrived of the plague 
having broken out in Alexandria, which prevents my going as I had 
intended by a ship now loading. I was packing to leave Masr. I fear I 
shall be detained here until next spring or summer.

28th.— Witnessed the festival of the Mearag, described in 
notebook no 3.* 

1st December.— The shopkeepers are decorating (as they call it) 
their shops; and most of the larger private houses, and many others, in 
the thoroughfare streets, are undergoing the same operation, by order 
of the government, in honour (it is said) of Ibraheem Basha, who is 
soon expected in Masr, from Syria. Most of the shops and houses are 
daubed with red and white, in broad, horizontal stripes; which, being 
very ill done in general, must be called in truth the reverse of 
decoration. Others are daubed in a more fanciful and more rude style, 
with lines, spots, &c., of red upon a white ground; and some, with 
grotesque representations of men, beast,, trees, boats, &c., such as very 
young children in our country would amuse themselves by drawing. 

26th.— I have been in Cairo just a year. I begin now to write out 
the fair copy of my work on the Modern Egyptians. The plague 
continues at Alexandria. 

4th January, 1835.— The plague has spread beyond Alexandria, 
and to-day a Maltese, from Alexandria, died here, in the Frank quarter, 
of this disease. I prepare immediately to go to Thebes, to be secure 
from the plague, as it is expected now to spread in Cairo. Mr. Fresnel is 
to accompany me. 

5th.— Engaged a large boat to take us to Thebes, for four hundred 
piasters. 

8th.— Embarked for Thebes, in the afternoon. Proceeded to Masr 
el-’Ateekah. 

9th.— Contrary wind. Remained at Masr el-’Ateekah. 

10th.— Fine wind. Passed Rikkah in the evening. 

11th.— High N. wind. Arrived at Benee Suweyf at noon. Here 
some fakeers, thinking us Turkish pilgrims, came and recited the Kur- 
an, for alms, by our boat. Proceeded. 

12th.— Passed El-Minyeh after sunset. 

13th.— Stopped before the grottoes of Benee Hasan at night. Early 
next morning landed to walk to the Speos Artemidos, which I had not 
hitherto seen. Took with me one of my servants (Khaleefeh, a young 
man), a Copt whom we had taken as a passenger to Thebes (’Abd el- 
Mellak), and two boatmen; one of these two boatmen was a very fine 
man, the other an old, fat, inactive fellow. Put my pistols in Khaleefeh's 
girdle; and myself carried nothing but my sword. A little above the 
grottoes above-mentioned is a ruined and deserted village by the river. 
About a mile further is another ruined village partly inhabited; and 
about the same distance beyond this is a third village, wholly 
inhabited, with palm-trees. We passed the first and second villages. A 
little beyond the latter we turn towards the mountains, and find a wide 
ravine or valley, in the right or southern side of which are several 
grottoes along the lower part of the rock. As we approached this ravine, 
several groups of people came out from the second village, with 
nebboots; and some with guns and pistols: two groups, about a dozen 
altogether, followed us: we saw that we were in danger, but it was too 
late to retreat. The men came to us. Some went back; others came; and 
soon there came another group from the third village, with a man in a 
clean blue gown, melayeh, and white turban: these sat a while at the 
entrance of the ravine, while we were within, with the other men, who 
spoke civilly to us, but looked exceedingly treacherous and savage. A 
boy who accompanied them whispered to my servant and the younger 


* Cp. Mod. Eg. pp. 468-70. 


boatman to keep close to me; for that the men with him had come to 
take them for soldiers. As it was now impossible to escape, I began to 
examine the line of grottoes, and prepared to make a drawing; merely 
that they might not be deceived by my dress, and take me for a Turk; 
as Europeans are more protected now in Egypt.— Soon after I had 
begun to make a sketch of this excavation, for the purpose before 
mentioned, the party that was at the entrance of the ravine came to us; 
and while my back was turned, they seized my servant and the younger 
boatman: the pistols were snatched from the servant and discharged 
and carried away and one of them broken, and the two prisoners were 
hurried off, while two men held me to prevent my drawing my sword, 
which, as they truly enough said, would have been the cause of my 
being immediately killed. As soon as the men who had taken my 
servant and boatman had proceeded a few hundred yards towards the 
principal village, the others left me with my two remaining attendants. 
As quickly as I could, I gathered together my instruments, and then 
pursued the party who had taken my two men. On my approaching 
them, three of them turned back (one of these, the chief, with the white 
turban, &c.), and desired me to return. I said I should follow them to 
the village, aud there liberate the prisoners. Upon this, they attacked 
with their long staves; and I received from the chief a blow on my 
chest, which obliged me to retreat, or I should without doubt have 
been killed. A boy who was with them followed me; brought back my 
pistols; kissed them twice, and, kneeling on the ground, presented 
them to me. The flints were taken out. My servant and the boatman, as 
I learned afterwards, were taken before the governor of the district that 
same day. A woman followed my servant, with feigned lamentations, 
crying, " Why do you say you are not my son ? Is not that decorated 
house the house of your father? and are not those palm-trees your 
father's palm-trees? and have not you eaten the red dates ? " This was 
to make the governor think that he was a young man of the village, and 
not stolen: for a number of men had been required from the village for 
soldiers; and the people of the village had been employing themselves 
in taking passengers instead. They took five others that same day; and 
one of these, who attempted to escape, they shot, in the presence of my 
servant.— I returned to my boat, with the intention of applying 
immediately to the governor (ma-moor) of the district. We were 
informed that he was at the village of Sakiyet Moosa, a few miles 
higher up the river, on the opposite (or western) bank. On arriving 
there, we found that he was at the opposite village of Esh-sheykh 
Timaee. The wind was so violent that we could not cross over with 
safety until the evening. We then landed there, about an hour after 
sunset. Accompanied by Mr. Fresnel, I went to his house. He was 
sitting with a number of attendants, in an open-fronted room (a 
mak’ad) facing a court, and, after the day’s fasting (it being Ramadan), 
was amusing himself by listening to the chanting of a public reciter of 
poetry. We entered with an abrupt and consequential manner, 
necessary to be assumed on such an occasion; and the governor rose to 
us, returned us the Muslim salutation, and gave up his own place to 
me; for I, having to make the complaint, was foremost. He handed me 
the snake of his sheesheh; and coffee was brought. I then made my 
complaint, with an air of assumed pride, shewed our firmans, which 
nobody present could read, and demanded the restoration of my 
servant and boatman, and the punishment of the men who had 
assaulted me; particularly of him who had struck me. The ma-moor 
did not confess that the servant and boatman had been brought to him 
that day at Benee Hasan, which was the case; but promised that they 



MEMOIR. xxiii 


should be restored, and that he would soften the feet of the men who 
had assaulted me. —On the following morning the servant was brought 
and given up to me; but the persons who brought him declared to the 
ma-moor that the boatman had made his escape, and that the men 
who had assaulted me had fled. So that I failed in my object of 
punishing them and gained but half what I wished. I found afterwards 
that the man who struck me was the sheykh of Benee Hasan: had I 
known this before, I could have insisted upon his being punished; as 
they could not have had the impudence to say that the sheykh would 
run away from his superior officer. 

14th.— Having obtained the liberation of my servant, proceeded 
to Mellowee. Remained there the following day.— 15th. Proceeded to 
Gebel El-Kuseyr. — 17th. Becalmed under Gebel El-Kuseyr. Towed a 
little. —18th. Passed Menfeloot after sunset.— 19th. Arrived at Asyoot 
at 1 P.M. Proceeded in the evening.— 20th. Passed Aboo Teeg at 1 
P.M.— 21st. Passed Akhmeem in the afternoon.— 22nd. Arrived at 
Girga. This town is much ruined since I was last here: it has suffered 
much from the river. Proceeded about noon. Made but little way. Saw a 
crocodile.— 23rd. Calm. Thermometer 73 0 . Proceeded by towing. 
Approaching the neighbourhood of Farshoot, saw nine crocodiles 
together, and shortly after, nineteen more.— 24th. Arrived at IIoo at 
sunset.— 25th. To Dishneh.— 26th. Saw nine crocodiles on two sand- 
banks opposite Dendara: Arrived at Kine at night.— 27th. Passed Kuft 
at night.— 28th. Saw about forty vultures (most of them rakhams, but 
many nisrs) on a sand-bank, in the morning, near the skeleton of a 
crocodile: afterwards, many pelicans and cranes. Proceeded a little way 
by towing, and afterwards by sail.— 29th. Last day of Ramadan. 
Arrived at El- Kurneh about 1 P.M. 

It was our intention to take up our quarters in a tomb which had 
been converted into a convenient dwelling by Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. 
Hay. We found Mr. Gosset occupying one apartment of it: I have taken 
possession of another apartment, separated from the former by a low 
wall with a door; and Mr. Fresnel has settled in a tomb just below, 
which was occupied by Bonomi and other artists in the employ of Mr. 
Hay. Our abode is in the Hill of the Sheykh, overlooking the whole 
plain of Thebes. A man named ’Owad has the charge of it; and Mr. 
Gosset and I pay him each 15 piasters a month for his services. 

April 3rd.— The Basha has paid a visit to this part of Egypt; went 
as far as Isna; and has just passed us on his way down. It is said that he 
came to inspect the state of the agriculture and to inquire into the 
conduct of the local governors; which he has not done. He has caused 
the villages of Erment to be destroyed; and the sheep &e. of all the 
inhabitants and of strangers who had sent their cattle &e. thither for 
pasture to be confiscated; because many of the peasants of these 
villages could not be made to pay their taxes. 

17th.— Good Friday.— A man of this place died to-day of the 
plague, taken by wearing the clothes of a Nubian boatman, who was 
landed here five days ago, ill of this disease, and placed under the 
sycamore at the landing-place to die; where he did die very soon after. 
The man of this place who died to-day was a relation of my guard; 
whom, as he has had intercourse with the family of the dead man, and, 
I am told, attended the funeral, I am obliged to dismiss for a time. Put 
ourselves in striot quarantine. M. Mimaut, the French Consul-General, 
who is staying at Luxor, put a stop next day to all communication 
between this side of the river and the opposite; but is to send us meat 
&c. every two days. 


20th.— Another man of this place, a relation of the one 
abovementioned, and father of Mr. Gosset's guard and water-carrier, 
died of the plague to-day, taken by wearing the clothes of the Nubian 
boatman. 

May 9th.— No more deaths by plague having occurred here, we 
gave up our quarantine this day; having confined ourselves three 
weeks. The plague is said to be very severe in Alexandria; and 
becoming so in the metropolis. 

June 25th.— The plague is said to have almost ceased in the 
metropolis and Alexandria in the beginning of this month. The French 
Consul has received intelligence that 75,000 persons have died by it in 
Masr; and that 6000 houses are completely desolated by this disease, 
and closed. We sent yesterday to Kine, for a boat to convey us to 
Masr,— and Mr. Gosset left yesterday. 

Our messengers came back from Kine without having procured a 
boat; finding the demands for boat-hire very high, on account of the 
number of pilgrims on their return from the Hegaz. We sent again; and 
procured a large dahabeeyeh to convey us to Masr, for 650 piasters; of 
which I am to pay half. 

30th.— Our boat arrived last night. We embarked to-day, and 
commenced our voyage at about 1 P.M. —1st July. Arrived early at 
Kine. Went to the remains of Dendara: found the first little temple 
destroyed; a great portion of the portal before the great temple, and 
part of the great temple itself, the upper part of the middle of the east 
side. In and about the temple were many fellaheen, hiding themselves, 
in the fear of being taken to work in making a new canal, or of being 
pressed for the army. Two or three cases of cholera had occurred at 
Kine: I heard of three deaths by this disease here: it is said to be also in 
the Hegaz. Continued our voyage in the afternoon.— 3rd. Arrived at

A few deaths by cholera have happened in the metropolis and its 
neighbourhood. Some persons say that the plague has not yet quite 
ceased here. It has destroyed a third, or more, of the population of the 
city; about 80,000 person.; chiefly young persons, between 10 and 25 
years of age; and most of these females. It has also been particularly 
fatal to Franks and other foreigners. 6000 house here have been 
desolated by it; and are closed. In riding through the whole length of 
the metropolis, froiA south to north, I saw so few people in the streets 
compared with the number I used formerly to see, and so few shops 
open, that I should have thought that more than half the inhabitants 
had been destroyed. This is partly to be accounted for by the fact of 
many persons having fled to the country to escape the plague.— Last 
Friday, a number of persons spread a report that many of the victims 
of the plague had been buried alive (in trance), and numerous women, 
children, and others, went out to one of the great burial-grounds to 
disinter their relations and friends, taking with them bread, water- 
melons, &c., for them. Several tombs were opened. Some ignorant 
people even believed that the general resurrection was to take place on

that day. The plague is still in Alexandria; but slight; two or three eases 
a day. 

16th.— To-day, being Thursday, when lamentations are renewed 
for persons not long dead, I was awoke early from my sleep by wailings 
in several houses around me. A few persons still die of the plague here. 


These cases are of persons attacked by the disease some days ago; a 
week or more. No new cases are heard of. 

20th.— Exaggerated reports are spread respecting the cholera 
here. It makes but little progress: the deaths not ten a day. The plague 
is very severely raging at Dimyat. 


The journal ends with two stories of the Plague noted on August 1 st and 2nd. Shortly after this Lane 
returned to England, carrying with him the manuscript of certainly the most perfect picture of a people's life 
that has ever been written, his "Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians." 


1835-1842. 


" The Modern Egyptians. " 

"The Thousand and One Nights. " Selections from the Kur-an. " 

THE first thing that occupied Lane's attention on his return to England was naturally to put the final touches to 
his book and to see it through the press. What with the ordinary delays of printers, and the time needed for the 
preparation of the wood-cuts, which he drew with his own hand on the blocks, the work was not published till 
December, 1836, by Mr. Charles Knight, who had bought the first edition from the Society for the Diffusion of 
Useful Knowledge. 

Those who had advised the Society in the matter had no cause for disappointment in the success of the 
book. The first edition, in two volumes, was wholly bought up by the booksellers within a fortnight of its 
publication. The second, the Society's, was to be much cheaper, and was therefore held back until the market 
was entirely cleared of the first. In 1837, however, it was brought out and stereotyped, with a first impression of 
four thousand copies, which were speedily disposed of. Two thousand five hundred copies in addition were 
struck off from the plates, and continued to be sold long after other and better editions had been issued. A third 
and revised edition, also in two volumes, was published by Mr. Knight in 1812. In 1840 the book was added to 
the series of "Knight's Weekly Volumes." Five thousand copies were printed, and half this large issue was sold 
by 1847. In i860 my father, E. Stanley Poole, edited the work again, in a single volume, for Mr. Murray, with 
some important additions; and from this, which must he regarded as the standard edition, a reprint in two 
small volumes was produced by Mr. Murray in 1871, and is now almost exhausted. Altogether, nearly seventeen 
thousand copies of the "Modern Egyptians" have been sold, a sufficient evidence of its popularity in England. If 
it is added, that a German translation was almost immediately produced, with the author's sanction, and that 
editions have been published in America, some idea will be formed of the European and trans-Atlantic repute 
of the book. 

The reviewers, who do not always echo the popular sentiment, were in this case singularly unanimous in 
their praise. A feeble but well-meant critique in the "Quarterly Review" could find no fault except with Lane's 
way of spelling Oriental names, which the reviewer travestied and then pronounced pedantic: the substance of 
the book met with his unqualified admiration. So it was with, I think, all the criticisms that appeared on the 
work. It was universally pronounced to be a masterpiece of faithful description. 

Oriental scholars, it need hardly be said, received it with acclamation. The distinguished Arabist, Fresnel, 
after a long residence in Egypt, wrote to Lane from Cairo in 1837: " I have read with a great deal of interest 
some of your chapters on the Modern Egyptians and felt immensely indebted to you for making, me acquainted 
with so many things of which I should have remained eternally ignorant, had it not been for your Thesaurus. " 
The following extract from my father's preface to the fifth edition explains very clearly in what the value of the 
work lies. If they are the words of a near kinsman, they are also those of an accomplished Arabic scholar and 
one who had lived long in Egypt. 

"Of the Modern Egyptians, as the work of an Uncle and Master, it would be difficult for me to speak, were 
its merits less known and recognised than they are. At once the most remarkable description of a people ever

written, and one that cannot now be re-written, it will always live in the literature of England. With a thorough 
knowledge of the people and of their language, singular power of description, and minute accuracy, Mr. Lane 
wrote his account of the "Modern Egyptians," when they could, for the last time, be described. Twenty-five 
years of steam-communication with. Egypt have more altered its inhabitants than had the preceding five 
centuries. They then retained the habits and manners of their remote ancestors: they now are yearly straying 
from old paths into the new ways of European civilization. Scholars will ever regard it as most fortunate that 
Mr. Lane seized his opportunity, and described so remarkable a people while yet they were unchanged. 

" A residence of seven years in Egypt, principally in Cairo, while it enabled me to become familiar with the 
people, did not afford me any new fact that might be added to this work: and a distinguished English as well as 
Biblical scholar, the Author of 'Sinai and Palestine,' not long ago remarked to me, ' The Modern Egyptians is 
the most provoking, book I ever read: whenever I thought I had discovered, in Cairo, something that must 
surely have been omitted, I invariably found my new fact already recorded.' l may add that a well-known 
German Orientalist [Dr. Sprenger] has lately visited Cairo with the express intention of correcting Mr. Lane's 
descriptions, and confessed that his search after mistakes was altogether vain."* 

After the " Modern Egyptians " had been published, and his time was once more his own, Lane employed 
himself in that favourite amusement of learned men, attending the meetings of societies. These bodies, 
however, had more life in them forty years ago than now, and their proceedings had not yet approached that 
debatable border line between learning and futility which has now been successfully crossed. The Asiatic 
Society, which still produces some good work, was then under the inspiriting influence of the Earl of Munster, 
and the Oriental Text Committee and the Translation Fund were bringing out that long series of works of which 
many are still most valuable, although some have deservedly died the death. At the meetings of these societies 
Lane was a prominent figure. Lord Munster regarded him as his right hand and would have his advice on 
everything connected with the work of the Committee and the Asiatic Society; and any problem in Arabic 
literature, any inscription that defied Prof. Shakespear and the other Orientalists of the Society, was referred to 
Lane and generally decided on the spot. But he was not a man to remain long contented with a sort of learned 
kettledrum-tea existence. He was wishing to be at work again; and the opportunity came very quickly. In the 
"Modern Egyptians" he had referred to the "The Thousand and One Nights," or "Arabian Nights" as they are 
commonly called, as forming a faithful picture of Arab life: and the remark had drawn more attention to the 
work than when it was merely regarded as a collection of amusing and questionably moral tales to be given to 
children with due caution. Lane was asked to translate them afresh. In his prospectus he showed that the 
ordinary English version was taken from Galland's French translation, which abounds in perhaps every fault 
which the most ingenious editor could devise for the destruction of a hated author. It is thoroughly inaccurate 
in point of scholarship; it misunderstands the simplest Arab customs and turns them into customs of India or 
Persia; it puts the whole into a European dress which destroys the oriental glamour of the original; and it mixes 
with the true Arabian Nights others which do not belong to the collection at all. Our English versions, based 
upon this, only magnified each vice and extinguished the few merits the work possessed in the French.

In these circumstances there could be no question that a new translation was necessary; and there was no 
man better able to translate a work illustrative of Arab life thaui the author of "The Manners and Customs of 
the Modern Egyptians." Cairo in Lane's time was still emphatically the Arab city. It had become the sovereign 
centre of Arab culture when the City of Peace was given up to the Tatar barbarians and Baghdad was no longer 
the home of the Khaleefehs. Under the Memlook Sultans, Cairo, and with it Arab art, attained the acme of its 
splendour; and the kings who left behind them those wonderful monuments of their power and culture in the 
Mosques of El-Kaihirah left also an established order of life, stereotyped habits of mind, and a ceremonious 
etiquette, which three centuries of Turkish rule had not yet effaced when Lane first visited Egypt. The manners, 
the dwellings, and the dress; the traditions and superstitions, the ideas about things in heaven above or in the 
earth beneath, of the actors in "The Thousand and One Nights" were those of the people of Cairo under the 
Memlook Sultans: and Lane was fortunate enough to have seen them before the tide of European innovation 
had begun to sweep over the picturesque scene.* 

Lane resolved to make his translation of " The Thousand and One Nights" a cyclopaedia of Arab manners 
and customs. He added to each chapter a vast number of notes, which are in fact monographs on the various 
details of Arabian life. Never did he write better or bring together more happily the results of his wide oriental 
reading and of his long Eastern experience than in these Notes. The translation itself is distinguished by its 
singular accuracy and by the marvellous way in which the oriental tone and colour is retained. The measured 
and finished language Lane chose for his version is eminently fitted to represent the rhythmical tongue of the 
Arabs: and one cannot take up the book without being mysteriously carried into the eastern dream-land; where 
we converse gravely with wezeers and learned sheykhs, or join the drinking-bout of a godless sultan; uncork 
’Efreets and seal them up again in their bottles with the seal of Suleyman, on whom be peace; follow Haroon- 
er-Rasheed and Jaafar in their nightly excursions; or die for love of a beautiful wrist that has dropped us a 
kerchief from the latticed meshrebeeyeh of the hareem. Those who would know what the Arabs were at their 
best time, what were their virtues and what their vices, may see them and live with them in Lane's " Thousand 
and One Nights." 

The book came out in monthly -parts in the years 1838 to 1840. It was illustrated profusely by W. Harvey, 
who succeeded in some slight degree in catching the oriental spirit of the tales; though his work is decidedly the 
least excellent part of the book. After the first edition, in three volumes, 1840, two others were produced in 
which the publishers sought to popularize the translation by restoring the old ignorant spelling of the heroes' 
names. All recognized the value of Lane's work, but they still had a prejudice in favour of their old 
acquaintances Sinbad and Giaffer, and could not immediately get used to the new comers Es-Sindibad and 
Jaafar. Moreover they missed Aladdin, who even under his reformed name 'Ala-ed-deen was not to be found in 
Lane at all. To obviate these objections, the publishers produced an emasculated edition reviving all the old 
mistakes and adding the inauthentic tales. Lane, however, immediately made a strong protest and the edition 
was withdrawn from circulation. In 1859 my father brought out the second and standard edition of the work, 


* I do not wish this to be taken as a defence of oriental abuses. There always comes a time when picturesque rottennes must give way to 
enlightened ugliness. But surely it is possible to reform the Turkish misgovernment of Egypt without pulling down the mosques and the beautiful palaces 
of Meemlook Beys which are still to he found in old corners of Cairo. Is it really a matter of necessity for a reforming Turk to wear a tightly-buttoned 
frock-coat? But Easterns seem to be able to copy only those peculiarities of Europeans which rightly make us a laughing stock to the judicious savage.

and this has since been several times reprinted; a new issue having been required this year. Although from the 
size and cost of the book, -a cost due mainly to the illustrations, which (as Lane himself thought) might well be 
dispensed with, -it cannot in its present form entirely drive out the miserable versions that preceded it, and that 
still live in the nursery: yet it is on all hands acknowledged to be the only translation that students of the East 
can refer to without fear of being misled. Every oriental scholar knows that the Notes are an essential part of 
his library. 

After this translation was finished, Lane, since he could not be idle, arranged a volume of "Selections from 
the Kur-an;" with an introduction, notes, and an interwoven commentary. The book did not appear till 1843, 
when its author was in Egypt and unable to correct the proofs. Consequently it is defaced by considerable 
typographical errors, and its publication in that state was a continual source of annoyance to Lane. The notion 
was an excellent one. He wished to collect together all the important doctrinal parts of the Kur-an, in order to 
show what, the religion of Mohammad really was according to the Prophet's own words: and lie omitted all 
those passages which weary or disgust the student, and render the Kur-an an impossible book for general 
reading. The result is a small volume which gives the ordinary reader a very fair notion of the contents of the 
Kur-an and of the circumstances of its origin. In this latter part of the subject there is, however, room for that 
addition and improvement which thirty years of continued progress in oriental research could not fail to make 
needful: and such alteration will be made in the new edition which is presently to be published. 

The "Selections" were but a napepyov. Lane was already embarked in the great work of his life, a work to 
which he devoted thirty-four years of unintermitting labour. 



1842—1849- 


THE THIRD VISIT TO EGYPT. 

LANE had seemingly exhausted modern Egypt. He had described the country, drawn a minute picture of the 
people's life, and translated their favourite romances. But there remained before him a still greater work, one 
indeed not bounded to any one country but concerning the whole Mohammadan world, and yet, like his other 
works, having its roots in Egypt. It was no longer a popular book that he was engaged upon: it appealed only to 
the narrow circles of the learned. But it is the work by which his name will ever be remembered, and by which 
England may claim the palm of Oriental scholarship, even above Germany, the home of Eastern study in 
Europe. 

It was impossible for Lane to acquire his intimate knowledge of Arabic without perceiving the lamentable 
deficiencies of the materials for its study then existing in European languages. Especially weak were the 
dictionaries: for Grammar could boast the magnificent works of De Sacy and Lumsden; whereas in the 
dictionaries of Golius and Freytag, if there were signs of learning and industry, there was also a dearth of 
material and a want of scholarship to interpret it, still more a lack of knowledge of Eastern minds, which 
resulted in statements calculated as much to mislead as to instruct the student. So long as the young 
Orientalists of Europe were reared upon the meagre food thus afforded to them, the standard of scholarship 
would be low and the number of students limited. Lane was well aware that it was not necessary to submit to 
this state of things from a want of the means of reforming it. On the contrary he knew that in Cairo there 
existed the richest materials the Arabic lexicographer could desire; and he determined himself to work the 
quarry and to produce a thesaurus of the language, drawn from original sources, which should once and for all 
supersede the imperfect productions of Golius and Freytag and bring the labours and learning of the Arab 
lexicographers within the reach of European students. 

The field into which Lane was about to throw all his energy was a peculiar one. The materials for 
composing such a work as he contemplated were singularly perfect.. For the exceptional history of the 
Mohammadan Arabs had produced a nation of grammarians and lexicologists. The rapid spread of the tide of 
Muslim conquest had threatened the corruption and even the extinction of the language of the Kur-an; other 
tongues were beginning to intermix with the pure Arab idiom; and it was foreseen that, were the process 
suffered to continue undisturbed, the sacred book of the Muslims would soon become unintelligible to the great 
body of the Faithful. 

"Such being the case, it became a matter of the highest importance to the Arabs to preserve the knowledge 
of that speech which had thus become obsolescent, and to draw a distinct line between the classical and post- 
classical language. For the former language was that of the Kur-an and of the traditions of Mohammad, the 
sources of their religious, moral, civil, criminal, and political code, and they possessed in that language, 
preserved by oral tradition,— for the art of writing in Arabia had been almost exclusively confined to the 
Christians and Jews, — a large collection of poetry consisting of odes and shorter pieces, which they esteemed 
almost as much for its intrinsic merits as for its value in illustrating their law. Hence the vast collection of 
lexicons and lexicological works composed by Arabs and by Muslims naturalized among the Arabs; which 
compositions, but for the rapid corruption of the language, would never have been undertaken. In the 



XXX 


MEMOIR. 


aggregate of these works, with all the strictness that is observed in legal proceedings . . . the utmost care and 
research have been employed to embody everything that could be preserved or recovered of the classical 
language, the result being a collection of such authority, such exactness and such copiousness as we do not find 
to have been approached in the case of any other language after its corruption or decay." * 

The earlier lexicographers and commentators constitute the authorities from whom all later writers have 
gathered their facts. They speak either of their own authority or they cite a statement word or a signification- 
illustrated often by a proverb and more frequently by a couplet, for all of which they produce what may be 
called a pedigree, so rigidly do they seek to exclude chance of error. "Most of the contents of the best Arabic 
Lexicons was committed to writing, or to the memory of students, in the latter half of the second century of the 

Flight, or in the former half of the next century From these and similar works, either immediately or 

through the medium of others in which they are cited, and from oral tradition, and, as long as it could be done 
with confidence, by collecting information from the Arabs of the desert, were composed all the best lexicons 
and commentaries on the classical poets, &c." + The information these lexicons impart is conveyed after the 
strict rules of the science of lexicology. Probably no original authorities are so thoroughly original as the works 
written in accordance with its rules. The writer of such a dictionary frequently says,— "I have heard an Arab of 
such a tribe say so-and-so," in support of a word or phrase. If he quotes from contemporaries, or from what 
constituted his original authorities, he always gives the source whence he gets his information. He is scrupulous 
not to assign undue weight to a weak authority. An authority was weak either because he lived after the 
classical age, or because he belonged to a tribe who spoke a corrupt dialect; or he might, if otherwise qualified, 
be known to be careless or otherwise inaccurate. The chronological limit of classicality was easily fixed. The 
period of classical Arabic does not extend much beyond the end of the first century of the Flight, except in the 
case of isolated tribes or rarely gifted men; but such are always quoted with caution. They were post- 
Mohammadan. Even poets (and poetry is the mainstay of the Arab) born during the Prophet's lifetime were of 
equivocal authority. The unquestioned Arab-he who spoke the pure and undefiled tongue— was either a 
contemporary of Mohammad's (i.e. born before but living during his time), or he altogether preceded him and 
belonged to the "Times of Ignorance." The purest of the recognized tribes were generally considered to be those 
who dwelt between the lowlands of the coast tracts and the inhabitants of the mountains, or as Aboo-Zeyd 
somewhat vaguely expresses it, "the higher of the lower and the lower of the higher, "t 

Thus the great Arabic dictionaries were gradually compiled. To enumerate them or to attempt to 
distinguish their several merits is beyond my present object. § It is enough to say that rather more than a 
hundred years ago a learned dweller in Cairo, the Seyyid Murtada, collected in a great lexicon, which he called 
the Taj-el-’Aroos, all that he deemed important in the works of his predecessors. He took for his text a 
celebrated dictionary, the Kamoos of El-Feyroozabadee, and wrote his own vast thesaurus in the form of a 
commentary upon it, interweaving the results of all the great authorities (especially the Lisan-el ’Arab) and 
adding from his own wide learning much that is valuable. The Taj-el-’Aroos is, in fact, a combination of all the

leading lexicons, and as such, and being compiled with great care and accuracy, is unquestionably the chief and 
best of native Arabic dictionaries. 

During his former residence in Egypt Lane had become aware of the existence of copies, or portions of 
copies, of this Thesaurus in Cairo; and the thought had come to him that herein lay the opportunity for 
constructing an Arabic Lexicon of a fullness and accuracy never yet dreamt of. To compose a work in English 
from the Taj-el-’Aroos would be, he saw, to provide the scholars of Europe with an authority once and for ever, 
from which there could be no appeal. But to attempt such a work would require another residence in Cairo, 
tedious and expensive transcribing of the Taj, long years of toil, and the wearisome labour of proof-sheets. And 
when done, who could be found to venture to publish so vast a work, involving peculiar printing at ruinous 
cost? 

The days of patronage were over: authors no longer waited in the vestibules of great men with odes and 
dedications. But the spirit that prompted the finest patronage still existed. There were those among the 
noblemen of England who were ready to devote their wealth to the cause of culture and learning, and who were 
emulous of promoting a great work that could not advance without their help. In his first visit to Egypt Lane 
had met Lord Prudhoe and from that time something closer than mere acquaintance had sprung up between 
them. Few could know Lane without seeking to be his friend: and his worth was not that of an uncut diamond; 
the courtesy and grace of his manners were conspicuous. Lord Prudhoe found a delight in his society which did 
not vanish when they returned to England. He would constantly come to the house in Kensington, bringing 
some choice tobacco-the only luxury Lane indulged in-and there he would sit in the study, talking over old 
Eastern scenes they had witnessed together, and discussing the work then going on, "The Arabian Nights," and 
Lane's plans of future study and writing. It was during these frequent meetings in London that the idea of the 
Lexicon was talked over. Lord Prudhoe entered zealously into the project; offered to provide Lane with the 
means of collecting the materials in Cairo, and eventually took upon himself the main expense of the 
production of the work. To understand in any degree the generosity and public spirit evinced in this, it must be 
remembered that it was no ordinary book, costing a few hundred pounds, that was thus to be produced. It 
involved the employment for thirteen years of a learned scholar in Cairo, to transcribe the manuscript of the 
Taj-el-’Aroos; it required peculiar type to be designed and cast; it demanded skilled compositors of special 
acquirements; and finally, it was not a work of ordinary size, but one of eight large quarto volumes with three 
columns in the page, reaching when completed probably to four thousand pages. To give more precise details of 
the expense of the work would be an impertinence to the princely generosity that took no count of the cost. 
From first to last the Lexicon was the care of Lord Prudhoe. In 1847 he succeeded his brother as fourth Duke of 
Northumberland, but the serious addition to his duties caused by this and by his. acceptance of a place in the 
Cabinet brought about no change in his interest in Lane's work. He would come almost yearly to Worthing to 
see my Uncle and learn from himself how " the great book " went on. Of the many who regretted His Grace's 
death in 1864, few lamented it more deeply than Lane. It was the severing of a long friendship, and a friendship 
which the generosity of the Duke, instead of destroying, as is the manner with the meaner sort of men, had 
cemented. But the bright example of the Duke created its own reflection. That support which for nearly a 
quarter of a century, "with a kindness and delicacy not to be surpassed," he had accorded to Lane's great 
undertaking was at once and at her own express wish* continued by his widow, Eleanor, Dowager Duchess of 
Northumberland; and to Her Grace's munificence it still owes its further publication. 


* On the death of Duke Algernon, his successor, formerly Lord Beverley, expressed a strong wish to continue the support of the 
work; and his son, the present Duke, has shown an equal interest in it

MEMOIR. 


The financial difficulties of the work being now overcome, Lane resolved on an instant departure for Egypt. 
His two previous visits had been solitary: but now he went surrounded by his family, -his wife, a Greek lady 
whom he had married in England in 1840, and his sister, Mrs. Poole, with her two sons, to whom he ever bore 
himself as a father, -just as he did twenty-five years later to two nephews of the next generation. A great sorrow 
had lately come upon them in the death of Lane's mother. In old age her intellect was as bright, her character as 
firm and tender, as they had ever been. To her sons and daughter she was as an angel from heaven. Over her 
youngest son, though he had lived among strange peoples and passed through dangers by sea and by land and 
was now a man on whom the eyes of the learned waited, this gentle woman still exercised that supreme 
influence which had inspired him when a boy with the noble principles and pure aspirations of the Higher Life; 
and to the last he rendered her the same love and obedience he had given as a child. It was this sore trouble 
that decided Mrs. Poole, who had lived in late years always with her mother, on accompanying her brother to 
Egypt, and from this time to his death she never left him for more than a few days at a time, unless summoned 
by the illness of her own sons. 

In June 1842 the little party of five returned to London from Hastings, whither they had removed in the 
autumn of the preceding year; and on July 1st they sailed for Alexandria in the Peninsula and Oriental 
Company's Steamship "Tagus," in itself an agreeable contrast to the small sailing vessels in which Lane had 
hitherto travelled, but still more pleasant in consequence of the special instructions of the Directors of the 
Company as to the comfort of their distinguished passenger. On July 19th they reached Alexandria, whence 
after a day or two they sailed up the Mahmoodeeyeh for Cairo. At first the whole party, but especially the two 
boys, then only twelve and ten years old, were so ill that it became doubtful whether a return to England were 
not the only remedy. The seasoning sickness, however, passed away, and on arriving at Boolak on July 27th 
Lane began again to look for a house, taking up quarters meanwhile at the General Consul's residence, which 
Col. Barnet (like Mr. Salt on a former occasion) had courteously placed at his service. It was not till three weeks 
later that a suitable house could be found, and from the one they then entered, in the Darb-el-Gemel, their 
servants, and therefore themselves, were driven, after a determined resistance of two months, by a series of 
extraordinary sounds and sights, which the Muslim servants attributed to the haunting of the place by a Saint 
and an ’Efreet, and which have not yet received a satisfactory explanation. * Being at length fairly expelled, like 
many people before and after them, they took refuge (in January 1843) in a house in the Harat es-Sakka-een, 
where they remained till the beginning of 1845, when they once more removed, to the Kawadees, where they 
lived till their return to England in 1849. 

It was a pleasant little society they entered into, for the seven years of their stay in Cairo: but it was too 
changing for strong friendships. There were it is true some kindly people always living in Cairo: such as the 
English Missionary, Mr. Lieder, and his good-natured wife; the English physician Dr. Abbott, to whose friendly 
services Lane owed much, and not least the Consul Mr. Walne. And for a long time Fulgence Fresnel was in 
Cairo and constantly with his fellow Orientalist, for whom he felt the affection of a brother. Mr. James Wild, 
too, the greatest authority on Arab art, was a very welcome addition to the little circle of friends, and it was 
perhaps partly his long association with Lane that opened his eyes to the beauty of Arab, as distinguished from

Moresque, architecture. And the latter part of their stay was brightened by the accession of two special friends, - 
Sir James Outram, the Bayard of India, who was never tired of coming to the house in the Kawadees; and the 
Hon. Charles Murray (now the Rt. Hon. Sir Charles Murray, K.C.B.), who had succeeded Col. Barnet as Consul- 
General, and who from the moment of his arrival exerted himself in every way to shield Lane from the 
importunate visits of passing travellers and to find amusement for my father and uncle, to whom he showed 
unvarying kindness. Among the Alexandrians, too, who constantly visited Cairo, Lane had found good friends, 
especially in the late Mr. A. C. Harris, Mr. Alexander Tod and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs Batho. 

But with these exceptions the society around them was ever on the ebb and flow, as the season for visiting 
Egypt went and came again. Of the many travellers who came to see the country, or passed through it on the 
way to India, not a few had introductions to Lane, and the acquaintance once made was not likely to be 
dropped so long as they remained in Cairo and the Friday receptions at Lane's house continued. This day, the 
Sabbath of the Muslims, was set aside for receiving the calls of his Muslim and other friends, and his wife and 
sister used to see the Europeans who came, in the Hareem rooms; so that on this day there was always a double 
reception. On different Fridays many of the most distinguished Orientalists of Europe and learned Easterns 
might be found in Lane's study- Lepsius, Wilkinson, Dieterici, D’Abbadie, Fresnel, Pruner, and others; with 
Sheykh Mohammad Eiyad, the Sheykli Rifa'ah, Haggee Hasan El-Burralee, the poet, and other literati of Cairo, 
who delighted to converse with the Englishman who had more than once decided the moot-points of the Ulama 
of the Azhar; whilst the less exclusively Oriental friends, and the few ladies who visited Cairo, such as Harriet 
Martineau, would betake themselves to the other side of the house, where Mrs. Lane and Mrs. Poole were "at 
home." 

Except on Fridays Lane denied himself to everybody, unless unusual circumstances made the interruption 
a necessity. On Sundays he never allowed himself, however much pressed for time, to continue his week-day 
work; nor did he like Sunday visitors. On all other days he devoted himself uncompromisingly to the 
preparation of his Lexicon. From an early breakfast to near midnight he was always at his desk, the long hours 
of work being broken only by a few minutes for meals— he allowed himself no more— and a scanty half-hour of 
exercise, spent in walking up and down a room or on the terrace on the roof. For six months together he did not 
cross the threshold of his house; and during all the seven years he only once left Cairo, and that was to take his 
wife and sister for a three days' visit to the Pyramids. At first he used to devote a short time every day to the 
classical education of his nephews, but even this was taken off his hands after a time by the kindness of the Rev. 
G. S. Cautlcy and the ready counsel of Mr. Charles Murray. But Lane continued to direct their studies, and it 
was by his advice that the elder devoted himself to the subject of modern Egypt and thus became a 
distinguished Arabic scholar, whilst the younger turned his attention to the ancient monuments, and, twice 
ascending the Nile and annotating Lane's earliest work, laid the foundations of his reputation as an 
Egyptologist. 

The Lexicon was indeed begun in earnest. The first thing to be done was the transcription of the Taj-el- 
Aroos, and for this purpose Lane before leaving England had already consulted Fresnel, who was then living in 
Cairo, and who, after careful investigation, recommended the Sheykh Ibraheem Ed-Dasookee for the work. The 
copyist must be able to do more than merely write the Arabic character, it need scarcely be said; he must 
understand the original as a scholar, and he must hold such a position among the learned of Cairo that he can

MEMOIR. 


be trusted with the manuscripts from the Mosques. Such a man was the Sheykh Ed-Dasookee; ill-tempered and 
avaricious, but still the right man for the work. Lane at first hoped to obtain the loan of at least large portions of 
the manuscript from the Mosque of Mohammad Bey. The Pasha himself, Mohammad ’Alee, was anxious to 
further the work by any means in his power, and the Prime Minister, Arteen Bey, called upon Lane with the 
view of discovering in what manner the Government could assist him. But the loan of manuscripts from the 
Mosques was a request beyond the power even of Mohammad ’Alee to grant; and Lane had to submit to the 
tedious process of borrowing through his Sheykh a few pages at a time, which were copied and then exchanged 
for a few more. Thus the transcription went on; and much of Lane's time was occupied in collating it with the 
original and in reading and annotating it in the company of the Sheykh Ed-Dasookee. But meanwhile there 
were other materials to be collected. It is true the main basis of the coming work was to be the Taj-el-’Aroos: 
but this was founded upon many other lexicons, and Lane determined so far as might be possible to verify its 
quotations and to take nothing at second-hand which could be obtained from the original source. Hence it was 
a matter of great consequence to gather together any manuscripts that could be bought in Cairo. Fresnel gave 
him three most valuable manuscripts, Mr. Lieder another; and by a careful watch on the book-market, by 
means of his old ally Sheykh Ahmad, he was fortunate enough to accumulate more than a dozen of the most 
renowned lexicons; and thus he was able to test the accuracy of the Taj-el-’Aroos, and to add greatly to the 
perfection and authoritativeness of his own work. 

After a preliminary study of Arabic lexicology,— a science complicated by technical terms of varying 
meaning,— and so soon as a portion of the Taj-el-’Aroos was transcribed, Lane began to compose his own 
Lexicon from the Taj and from the other dictionaries he had collected. Thus from year to year the work went 
slowly on; collating, collecting, composing filled each day, each month, each year. At length the materials were 
gathered, the Taj was transcribed up to a sufficiently advanced point, and Lane felt he need stay no longer in 
Egypt. So leaving Mr. Lieder to keep the Sheykh to his work of copying,— which, now it is finished, fills 24 large 
volumes,— Lane and his family bade farewell to the friends who had risen around them, and reaching 
Alexandria on the 5th October, 1849, sailed on the 16th for England, where they arrived on the 29th. 

Such is the brief account of Lane's third visit to Egypt, and the beginning of the Lexicon. It was a time of 
unremitting exhausting labour: but it was a happy time. Lane had his wife and sister with him, and his home 
was brightened by two young faces, full of the excitement and delight of their new and marvellous 
surroundings. A cloud had fallen upon them, indeed, in 1844, when they heard of the death of the eldest 
brother, Theophilus Lane; and some days of deep anxiety had befallen Lane when both wife and sister lay 
dangerously ill with cholera and typhus fever. But on the whole the seven years had been years of happiness. 
His sister had gained for herself a place in literature by her "Englishwoman in Egypt," his two nephews had 
each marked out for himself a career as an Orientalist; he himself had accomplished his purpose and gathered 
together the materials and begun the composition of the great work of his life. 



1849—1876. 

The Arabic Lexicon. 


LANE returned to Europe in 1849 the acknowledged chief of Arabic scholars. As the author of "The 
Modern Egyptians" his fame as the authority upon Egypt had been established; and his translation of the 
Arabian Nights had gained him the well-earned repute of accurate scholarship. But when it became known 
on what work he was now engaged and when specimens had shown how thoroughly that work would be 
done, all who had a care for learning were eager to offer their homage. As early as 1839 the Egyptian 
Society had enrolled him among their honorary members. In 1846 the German Oriental Society elected 
him a corresponding, member, and in 1871 raised him to their highest rank, that of Ehren-Mitglied; and 
the example of Germany was followed, at a distance, by England, in the elections to the Honorary 
Membership of the Royal Society of Literature (1858) and of the Royal Asiatic Society (1866). In 1864 a 
vacancy occurred in the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the Institut de France, by the 
promotion of De Witte, and Lane was unanimously elected a Correspondent' in his place; and in 1875, on 
the occasion of its Tercentenary Festival, the University of Leyden accorded to him the degree of Honorary 
Doctor of Literature (Philosophiac Theoreticae Magister, Litterarum Humaniorum Doctor)— the only 
University degree he ever accepted, though not the only one offered to him. Those singular decorations, 
chiefly of military origin, which learned men are sometimes pleased to receive from their Sovereign, were 
by Lane decidedly though respectfully declined. 

It was not, however, only in the matter of diplomas that a strong interest was shown in the great work 
my Uncle was preparing. So soon as the immense cost of the production was known, and before Lord 
Prudhoe had taken upon himself the expense of printing it, efforts were made, though not by the author, 
to obtain for it the support it needed. The Chevalier Bunsen exerted himself in a most friendly manner to 
gain the help of the English Universities: but it need hardly be said in vain. On the other hand, Germany 
was anxious to obtain the distinction of supporting it. At the instance of Bunsen, Lepisius, and Abeken, 
seconded by many others, it was agreed to offer to publish the Lexicon at the joint expense of the Prussian 
Government and the Berlin Academy of Sciences; and in 1846 Prof Dieterici was sent by the King of 
Prussia to Cairo to consult Lane's wishes. There were, however, conditions named to which Lane "could 
not willingly accede "; and moreover the arrangements for publishing in England were, by the zealous 
exertions of his brother Richard, nearly completed. In 1848 Lord John Russell, then Premier, made the 
first of a series of annual grants from the Fund for Special Service, which Lord Aberdeen continued in 
1853; and in 1863 the grant was changed into an annual Pension on the Civil List. 

On his return to England Lane soon settled down into his old routine of work. The composition went 
slowly on, and the manuscript of the Taj-el-’Aroos was gradually completed and sent over. At last, when he 
had been twenty years at the work Lane felt he might begin printing. In 1863 the First Part appeared, and 
in two years' time the Second followed. The Third was published in 1867, and the Fourth was printed in 
1870, but the whole edition of one thousand copies was unfortunately burnt before it reached the 
publisher, with the exception of ' a single copy and the entire Part had to be printed again, and therefore 



XXXVI 


MEMOIR. 


did not appear till 1872. After the necessary two years' interval Part V. was published in 1874. The Sixth 
Part was half-printed (as far as p. 2386) when its author died; and it has taken me a year to finish it (1877). 
Two Parts remain to be published, besides the Second Book, which may be estimated at one or. perhaps 
two Parts more. 

The publication of the Lexicon more than confirmed the high expectations that had been formed of it. 
As Jules Mohl well said, each article is a perfect monograph recording all that can be recorded on the 
subject. Each statement is followed by initials indicating the authorities from which it was derived, except 
where Lane has interwoven, within brackets, his own remarks and criticisms. Thus the work is, in point of 
authoritativeness, as sufficient for the student as if he possessed all the original manuscripts from which it 
is compiled. And whereas in the native writers method is unknown and meaning follows meaning in no 
settled sequence, Lane has succeeded in arranging each article in logical order, distinguishing between 
primary and secondary meanings, and making the various significations of each root a connected whole, 
instead of a chaotic congeries of inexplicable contradictions. The value of the manner as well as of the 
matter was instantly recognized by the Orientalists of Europe. There was no question of rivalry: all and 
each were agreed absolutely to submit to an authority which they saw to be above dispute. The greatest 
Arabist of Germany used to send Lane from time to time monographs of his own inscribed with the words 
"Unserem Grossmeister" and the like; and his homage is but an example of the reverence felt by all for the 
" Schatzmeister der arabisehen Spraehe." 

But this universal appreciation of his work did not induce Lane to slacken for a moment the severe 
tension of his monotonous toil. He never rested on his laurels for a single day. He felt that it was a work 
demanding more than one lifetime, and he determined to leave as little undone as he could. After a year at 
Hastings he moved to the milder climate of Worthing, and during; the twenty-five years he lived there he 
left the place but once, going to Brighton to see his old friend Outram; and nothing but severe illness could 
compel him to take a day's rest. 

These years at Worthing were a time of constant unvarying labour,—" Of toil unsever'd from 
tranquility, Of labour that in lasting fruit outgrows Far noisier schemes, accomplished in repose, Too great 
for haste, too high for rivalry." My Uncle would go to his desk after an early breakfast and work for three 
or four hours in the morning. An early dinner then made a necessary interruption, but afterwards lie 
would begin again without a moment's delay, and continue writing till about four o'clock, when if the 
weather were fine and he in fair health he would walk with some of his family for an hour or so. Then he 
would come back to tea, and from six to ten would again bury himself in manuscripts, when a simple 
supper would end the day. At first his afternoon walk extended to three or four miles; but as his strength 
waned he gradually shortened the distance, till in his last year he could only saunter gently up and down 
some shady road for half-an-hour, and even then found himself exhausted. So too he was at last induced 
by the entreaties of his family to close his books at nine o'clock instead of ten; but even then he 
accomplished eight hours of study in the day. Nothing was allowed to interfere with these hours of work. 
Visitors who asked for him were strictly denied, and it was only by calling on his wife or sister that it was 
possible to see him, and then only if he was at a point in his composition where interruption would not 



MEMOIR. 


XXXVII 


entail a serious delay. Yet these rare moments were sufficient to win for him the lasting affection of a small 
circle of friends, who were never weary of offering him every attention in their power, and far from taking 
amiss his rigid seclusion endeavoured in all ways to shield him from the intrusion of strangers. He never 
called anywhere; but sometimes he would take his afternoon stroll in the gardens of Warwick House, 
where the bright society of his kindly hostesses was a delightful relief after his arduous hours of study. 

One day in the week Lane closed his books. His early training had led him to regard Sunday as a day 
to be set apart for the things of religion, and his long sojourn in the East had in no wise weakened this 
feeling. In Egypt he had frequently attended the prayers at the Mosques and there comported himself in 
all outward appearance as a Muslim: but this was only because without thus conforming to the ways of the 
people he could never have acquired that knowledge of their character which he afterwards turned to so 
great an account. To the last he preserved the simple earnest faith of his childhood. His acquaintance with 
the original languages of the Old and New Testament and his insight into Semitic modes of thought had 
certainly modified his views on some of the minor points, but in the essential doctrines of Evangelical 
Christianity his belief never changed. But his religion was not a mere matter of intellectual adhesion to a 
given series of dogmas: he carried it into his every-day life. The forms of grace at meals, to most people 
purely ceremonious, were to him realities, and he never began his day's work without uttering the Arab 
dedication Bismi-llah—" In the name of God." No one who came within the reach of his influence, however 
great the disagreement in opinion, could fail to be impressed with the earnestness of Lane's convictions; 
and few talked with him without going away better men than they came. His high and pure soul shone in 
his countenance, in his manner, in his every word. In his presence a profane or impure speech was an 
impossibility: yet no one was ever more gentle with that frailty for which the world has no pity. He was a 
Christian Gentleman, of a fashion of life that is passing away. 

Sunday was to Lane a day of religion rather than a day of rest. In the morning or afternoon he would, 
if he were well enough, attend the office of the Church of England. The remainder of the day he spent 
chiefly in Biblical study, for 'which as a Hebrew scholar he possessed a critical knowledge that most of our 
divines might have envied. But it was not as a philological amusement that he pursued his researches. To 
him the Bible was the guide of his life; and he used his every endeavour to understand each doubtful 
passage, to emend each ignorant rendering, to interpret by the light of Semitic thought those dark sayings 
which the Aryan translators comprehended not, and not least to discover the harmony of Scripture and 
science. Thus his Sundays were not a time of thorough rest, such as the severe character of his week-day 
work required them to be. His Biblical reading often tried him more than a day's work at the Lexicon, and 
the parallel lines of ordinary print weakened eyes accustomed to the flexuous writing of Arabic 
manuscripts. 

So the years wore on. Day followed day, and year year, without seeing any change in the monotony of 
Lane's life. Manuscript was written, proofs came and went, volumes were published, with unvarying 
regularity. The Lexicon was Lane's one occupation. The review and the essay, the offspring, of the idle 



MEMOIR. 


xxxviii 

hours of learned men, had no attraction to a man who could not boast an idle moment. The only 
contributions he ever sent to a journal were two essays that appeared in the "Zeitschrift der deutsehen 
morgenlandischen Gesellschaft." * With these exceptions Lane never allowed any literary pursuit to divert 
him from his work. Even the revision of new editions of his earlier works demanded more time than lie 
would spare, and he therefore left* it to his nephews. 

In 1867 Lane experienced one of the great sorrows of his life. He had seen both his sister's sons well 
advanced in their several careers: but he was destined to lose the one whom he had regarded as his own 
successor, the continuer of his life-work and the heir to his fame. My father's early death struck a heavy 
blow at Lane's love and hope. It was as the loss of an eldest son. Twenty-seven years before, he had taken 
to his home his sister and her sons; and now, with the same unselfish readiness, he opened his door to the 
three children whom my father's death had left orphans. From this time my Uncle's house was home and 
he was a second father to me. It was no slight sacrifice to admit three children to his quiet life: but he 
never let us know that it was a sacrifice at all I can never forget the patience with which he suffered all our 
childish waywardness, the zealous sympathy with which he entered into our plans and pleasures, his 
fatherly counsel and help in our boy troubles, his loving anxiety in sickness. The few moments that he 
could spare from his work, which he might well have devoted to his own recreation, were given to us. He 
delighted to lead us to the studies he had loved himself, and would bring from the stores of his memory 
that scientific knowledge which had formed the favourite pursuit of his boyhood. And when I had chosen 
for myself the same field of study to which he had devoted his life, he gave me daily that help and advice 
which no one could give so well; read and revised everything I wrote; and at length, when his health was 
failing, gave me a last proof of his trust by confiding to me the completion of his own work. 

The life of the great Orientalist was drawing to its close. Frequent attacks of low fever, added to the 
exhaustion of chronic bronchitis, had seriously weakened a frame already enfeebled by excessive study. I 
seldom left my Uncle for a few weeks without the dread that I should never see him again. It was a marvel 
how that delicate man battled against illness after illness, never yielding to the desire of the weary body for 
rest, but unflinchingly persevering with the great task he had set before him. His own knowledge of his 
constitution, acquired by long residence in places where medical help was not to be had, served him in 
good stead; and his life was ever shielded by the devoted care of his wife and sister, and the friendly 
attention of Dr. Henry Collet, who for many years afforded my Uncle the great advantage of his constant 
advice; a service of love which was continued after Dr. Collet's death, with the seal of long affection, by his 
son, Mr. A. H. Collet. 

But the time came when there was no longer strength to withstand the approach of death. At the 
beginning of August, 1876, my Uncle was suffering from a cold, which presently showed signs of a serious 
nature. He went on with his work till Saturday the 5th; and then a decided change came over him. The 
weakness increased to such a degree on Sunday that he allowed me to support him about the house, though 

* The first of these is entitled " Ueher die Lexicographie der arabischen Sprache," and appeared in Bd. III. SS 90—108 (1849). It is in the form of a 
letter to Prof. Lepsius, and treats of the principal Arabic Lexicons, and gives specimens of Lane's own work. The other article was " Ueber die Aussprache 
der arabischen Vocale und die Betonung der arabischen Worter," an excellent treatise on the pronunciation of the Arabic Vowels and on the accent (Bd. 
IV. SS. 171-186, 1850).

never before would he accept even the help of an arm. That evening we induced him to go early to his bed: 
and he never again rose from it. Two days passed in anxious watching. Everything that love could prompt, 
or the affection and skill of the doctor could suggest, was done. On Wednesday evening he seemed better: 
it was but the last effort. Early on Thursday morning the brave loyal spirit fought its last battle, and the 
mind that had endured the strain of fifty years of ceaseless toil, and yet had never known decay, at last 
found rest. 

So ended the Scholar's life. It was begun, continued, and ended, without hope of reward. For fame he 
cared little; money, beyond what sufficed for his modest wants, he desired not. Pure love of knowledge was 
the motive of his work, and to learning, unsoiled with baser aims, he dedicated a long and studious life, 
rich in fruits. To the world Lane must be the ideal scholar. With us who knew him his memory will live in 
the sweeter thought of the noble and pure heart that wrapped us in its love.

Mufradat [of Er-Raghib]; in which it is added 
that it is also used as meaning simply the being 
happy, joyful, or glad: and sometimes as meaning 
simply the wondering [at a thing]; and this is the 
meaning intended by him who says that it is 
peculiar to man: (TA:) [i. e.] 44 = 4 = ; said of a man,

[See a".]) Said of an ape, He uttered a cry 

or cries: (K:) or one says of the ape when he 
utters a cry or cries, (s, TA,) meaning 

he displays his teeth, or grins. (TA.) — — 
And (tropical:) The clouds 

lightened. (S, O, K, TA.) Hence the usage of the 
verb in a trad, cited voce (o, TA.) — — 

And jj 4 JI i. e. (tropical:) [The pool of water 
left by a torrent] glistened by reason of 

its fulness. (TA.) [And » (assumed

TA;) accord, to some, from the ^ 1 =^= [meaning 
the interior] of the k*lL [of the palm-tree] when 
it bursts open; (ISd, TA;) and hence, (K, TA,) said 
also in this sense of a woman, (O, Msb, K, TA,) 
accord, to Mujahid, (O, TA,) and some 
others, (TA,) in the Kur xi. 74, (O, K, TA,) where 
some read cjSA-is, which is said to be a well- 
known dial, var.; (TA;) and likewise, accord, to 
some, said in this sense of the hyena, (O, TA,) 
when she sees blood, or as IAar says, when she 
eats the flesh of men and drinks their blood: 
(TA:) [it is commonly asserted by the Arabs that] 
the hare menstruates like women: (Kzw:) but 
with respect to this meaning as assigned to the 
verb in the Kur xi. 74, Fr says that he had not 
heard it from any person deserving of confidence; 
(O, TA; *) and Zj says that it is nought: both say 
that the meaning there is, she laughed by reason 
of happiness: (TA:) and some say that there is an 
inversion in this case, what is meant being UU jiis 


(Fr, O, TA:) or the meaning is, 
she wondered; so says I'Ab; and so Er-Raghib, 
who adds that it is confirmed by her saying, “ 
shall I bring forth a child when I am an old 
woman, and this my husband is an old man? 
verily this is indeed a wonderful thing: ” and 
that which is inserted by some of the 

expositors after e’Ay i yA is not an explanation of 
this expression, as some of them have imagined it 
to be, but is the mention of [a fact which was] a 
sign that the announcement was not that of an 
event improbable: or the meaning is, she was 
frightened; so says Fr.: (TA:) and with respect to 
the meaning of this verb when said of the hyena, 
mentioned above, it is rejected by AHat and 
others: (TA:) IDrd says, on the authority of AHat, 
respecting the following verse of 
TaabbataSharra, cfjSj 

tjj Cjjill that the meaning is (assumed 
tropical:) The hyena displays her teeth, or grins, 
on account of the slain [of Hudheyl], when she 
sees them, like as they say of the ass when he 
plucks out the [plant called] (O, TA;) or, as 

others say, (assumed tropical:) the hyena snarls, 
displaying her teeth; and sees the wolf raising his 
voice in calling the [other] wolves to them, i. e. to 
the slain: (O, TA:*) Abu- 1 -' Abbas says that the 
meaning is, (assumed tropical:) the 
hyena displays her teeth, because the wolf 
contends with her over the slain: and some say 
that the poet means, (assumed tropical:) the 
hyena rejoices because of the slain. (TA.) — — 
One says also, meaning (assumed 

tropical:) The » j •»“ [or gum-acacia-tree] flowed 
with its gum: from meaning * she 

menstruated. ” (Bd in xi. 74.) 3 [inf. n .

tropical:) [It made the hyena to display her

overflowed: (O, TA:) its glistening being likened

[BOOKI.]

and a thing that quits its place, i Gi4=[ (ib, TA,) 
which means I lost it, and knew not its place; 
meaning, for instance, a horse, or she-camel, or 
the like: (Az, Msb:) [thus] one says, lS j&j [I 

lost my camel, and knew not his place,] (AA, ISk, 
S, IB, O) when his shank has been tied up to his 
arm and one does not find the way to him, and 
when he has been left loose and has gone away 
whither one knows not: (AA, IB, TA:) hut 
Yoo differs from others respecting this case; for, 
accord, to him, one says, “la*! (4=1 and 

also G4= ; in the same sense; (O, TA;) and the like 
is said in the K: (TA:) and it is also said in the 
Bari’ that when you seek an animal and miss its 
place and find not the way to it, it is regarded as 
in the category of stationary things, and therefore 

you say Gl4=. (Msb.) (4= signifies also He 

was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and 
unable to see his right course. (Ibn-Es-Seed, TA.) 

Also, aor. 3 - 4 = (S, O, K) and 3 - 1 -=. (K,) 

the pret. being like (1 j and (4, (TA,) inf. n. lD 4= ; 
It (a thing, S, O, TA) became lost; [as though 
it went astray;] it perished, came to nought, or 
passed away. (S, O, K, TA.) Thus in the 
phrase IG (4= Such a thing became lost from 
me. (Mgh.) One says to him from whom pieces of 
money have dropped, Cil4= ia [They have 
become lost from thee]. (TA.) And to him who 
has done a deed from which no profit has 
resulted, you say, (4= ^ (tropical:) [Thy 
labour has been lost]: the like occurs in the Kur 

xviii. 104 , meaning ^'~=. (TA, in two places.) 

And (tropical:) He (a man, TA) died, and became 
dust and bones. (K, TA.) In this sense the verb 
is used in the Kur xxxii. 9 : but some there read, 
in the place of 44= ,44= [q. v.], with (TA:) or 
the verb in that instance has the meaning here 

next following. (S.) And (assumed tropical:) 

He, or it, (a man, S, TA, or a camel, Msb, and a 
thing, TA,) was, or became, unperceived or 
imperceptible, unapparent, latent, hidden or 
concealed, or absent, (S, Msb, K, TA.) Hence the 
phrase, uP *4 4ill (4= (tropical:) [The water 
became unperceived, or concealed, in the 
milk]. (TA.) One says of a road to which he has 
not been able to find the way, < 4 ^ (4= [It has 
become hidden from me]. (K, TA.) And hence 
also the saying of a man, as is related in a trad., 
(S, O, TA,) after his having charged his sons by 
saying to them, “When I die, burn ye me; and 
when I shall have become ashes, pound me; then 
scatter me in the water: ” (O, TA:) -dll =4=' 4*1 (S, 
O, TA) i. e. (assumed tropical:) May-be, I shall be 
unperceived by God, or concealed from Him: (S:) 
or may-be, I shall be hidden, or absent, from 
God’s punishment: (O, TA:) or, as El-’Otbee says, 


may-be, I shall escape God, and my place will be 
hidden from Him. (TA.) And (4= said of one 
forgetting means (assumed tropical:) 
His memory became absent from him. (O, Msb, 
TA.) UiljAl (4=3 (j!, or (4=3 u], in the Kur [ii. 282 ], 
accord, to different readers, (TA,) in 
which instance 4 and u] are syn., (Mughnee, 
[see u', in p. 106 , cols. 1 and 2 ,]) means If one of 
them twain [referring to women] be absent from 
her memory: or if the memory of one of them 
twain be absent from her: [or if one of them 
twain err in her memory:] or, accord, to Zj, the 
meaning of the verb in this case is that which 

next follows. (TA.) «44l *44= also signifies 

(assumed tropical:) I forgot the thing: whence 
one says of a woman, ' g ,4 > 1 = 4 = (assumed 
tropical:) [She forgot the days of her 
menstruation]; and so 1 44=( (Mgh:) or dila j— = 
(assumed tropical:) He was made, or caused, to 
forget such a one. (K. [In the CK, 4-G is 
erroneously put for G*=ji.]) It is said that (4=) V 
^ J, in the Kur xx. 54 , means (assumed tropical:) 
My Lord will not be unmindful: or nothing will 

escape Him. (TA.) And one says, Cp* <= 4“=, 

(Msb, K,) or pa jyl 4—*, (O,) meaning 

Such a one went away from me, (O, Msb, K,) and 
I was unable to compass him [or to find him]: so 
in the Bari’. (Msb.) — (4=, as a verb of wonder: 
see (4=. 2 G4= ; (s, MA, O, K,) inf. n. J=4*> 
and (44== ; (K,) He, or it, made, or caused, him to 
pursue a course that led to error, or deviation 
from the right way: (K: [see also 4 :]) he, or it, led 
him astray; seduced him: (MA:) [or] he 

attributed, or imputed, to him error, or deviation 
from the right way. (S, MA, O.) fs4-*= 34=, a 
phrase used by a poet, means Error, or deviation 
from the right way, was attributed to their 
labour; because they did not reach their goal. 

(Ham p. 771 .) [Hence,] one says, 41li (J4= 

Send forth, or set free, thy cattle to pasture, or 
to pasture where they please, by themselves. (O.) 
— — See also the next paragraph. 4 4=1, inf. 
n. (44=1, He, or it, made him, or caused him, 
to err, stray, or go astray; to deviate from the 
right way or course, or from that which was right; 
to miss, or lose, the right way; or to lose his way. 
(Az, TA.) [See also 2 , first sentence.] (44=VI is of 
two sorts: one of these is the consequence of 
erring, or straying; either as in the case in which 
one says 4*4 cJ4=i (expl. above, see 1 , former 
half); or the decreeing that one shall err, or stray, 
& c., because he has done so already, and this is 
sometimes the case when the J4(=l of a man 
is attributed to God: the other sort is the 
embellishing [or commending] to a man that 
which is false, or wrong, or vain, in order that he 


may err, or stray, &c.: and God’s =44=1 of a man 
is of two sorts; one of which has been expl. above; 
the other is God’s so constituting man that when 
he observes [and pursues] a certain course, or 
way, [of acting or the like], whether it be such as 
is commended or such as is discommended, 
he habituates himself to it, and esteems it 
pleasant, and keeps to it, and finds it difficult to 
turn from it, wherefore it is said that custom is a 

second nature. (Er-Raghib, TA.) Also He, or 

it, made, or caused, him, or it, to perish, or 
become lost; syn. Giii, (s, TA,) and 144=1, (El- 
Farabee, S, O, Msb,) or -44=; (TA;) [4l*i=l 
and 44= signifying the same; and so <4=1 and 
j a1Lj=; whence,] 4 4 GS (44 pl ; in the Kur 
cv. 2 , means [Did He not make their plot to be 
such as ended] in a causing to perish, or become 
lost, (t»Gu ul,) and in annulment? (Ksh, 
Bd.) pJUil (til, in the Kur [xlvii. 1 and 9 , which 
may be rendered (assumed tropical:) He will 
cause their works to be lost, or to be of no effect], 
means, accord, to Aboo-Is-hak, He will 
not recompense them for their good works; the 
phrase being similar to the saying Gl*^ (4= (2 
[expl. above]. (TA.) And -dll (til 

(assumed tropical:) [May God make thine erring 
to be no more, or to come to an end,] is expl. by 
ISk as meaning may thine erring pass away from 
thee, so that thou shalt not err; and he adds that 
the saying dllXi (ii means (4> Y =44 diio = 4 . 2 . 

(TA.) Also (tropical:) He buried, and hid, or 

concealed, him, or it. (K, TA.) You say, 44l (4=1 
(tropical:) The dead was buried. (S, O.) The 
phrase 4 ^ =li4=l, meaning (tropical:) His 
mother buried him, in a verse cited by IAar, is 

extr., or anomalous. (TA.) And He found 

him to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating 
from the right way or course, or from that which 
was right; missing, or losing, the right way; losing 
his way; not rightly directed, or not finding the 
way to the truth: like as one says »4=J, 
and GLjL (TA.) — — And you say, l4 44=i, 
meaning (assumed tropical:) Such a thing was, 
or became, beyond my power, or compass. (IAar, 

Msb, TA.) See also 1 , near the end. 5 =4=3 it 

went away: so in the saying, =4=1 ^ lull =)4=1

stone]. (O, TA.) 6 ()4=1 He feigned himself to be 
erring, straying, going astray; deviating from the 
right way or course, or from that which was 
right; missing, or losing, the right way; or losing 
his way. (O, TA.) 10 Gl4= (4=1*= I His erring 
demanded that he should err [the more], so that 
he did err [the more: like as erring is said to be a 
cause of one’s being made to err: see 4 : and see

(MF, TA:) the primary signification of 3144=11 is 
the going away from the right course, or

Ibn-El-Kemal, the loss, or missing, of that 
which brings, or conducts, to the object sought: 
or, as some say, the pursuing a way that will not 
bring, or conduct, to that object: or, accord, 
to Er-Raghib, the deviating from the right way: 
and it is said to be any deviation from that which 
is right, intentional or unintentional, little or 
much; because the right and approved way is 
very difficult; wherefore it may be used of him 
who commits any mistake whatever, and is 
imputed to prophets and to unbelievers, though 
between the 3144 = of the former and that of the 
latter is a wide difference: and in another point of 
view, it is of two sorts; one is in the speculative 
departments of knowledge, as in acquaintance 
with the unity of God, and with the 
prophetic function or office, and the like, 
indicated in the Kur iv. 135 ; or it is in the 
practical departments of knowledge, as in

is, religious services. (TA.) Also A state of

He broke his compact, contract, or covenant]. 
The phrase, in a trad., J, JUJI y ^ means 
He forbade the expending of wealth otherwise

the next paragraph. 4 see 2, first 

sentence, and last but one. Also, [and app.

or being mindful of them. (TA.) 4111 ij -S '-ij 

in the Kur [ii. 138], means And God will 
not neglect [or make to be lost] your prayer. 
(TA.) I in the same, [xix. 60,] means 

Who neglected, or omitted, prayer, (Bd, 
TA,) altogether: (TA:) or deferred it: (Bd:) or who 
performed it in other than its right time: but the 
first explanation is more suitable, for 
the unbelievers are meant thereby. (TA.) —

a revenue, or of a house and palm-trees, or the

yielding a revenue; (K;) or with the people of the 
towns and villages and cultivated lands it 
signifies the property, of a man, consisting 
of palm-trees and grape-vines and land: but the 
Arabs [of the desert] know not the word in this 
sense: (Az, TA:) IF says, I do not reckon 


the application of this word as a name for the

an innovation in speech; and I have heard it said 
that this is termed a because, when frequent 
attention to it is neglected, it perishes; and if it be 
so, this is an evidence of what we have said, that 
it is of the innovated speech: (O, TA:) the dim. is 
J, for which one should not say ^iy^: (S, 

O, K:) the pi. is £44= and jj-fy (S, O, Msb, K,) as 
though the latter were a contraction of the 
former, (Msb,) and (K:) accord, to Lth, 

the first of these pis. signifies places of alighting 
or abode or settlement; which are thus called 
because, when the paying frequent attention to 
them, or taking good care of them, and the 
keeping them, or putting them, in a good state, or 
state of repair, is neglected, they come to nought: 
and occurs in a trad, as meaning the 

means of subsistence. (TA.) And, (T, O, Msb, K,)

not the word in any other sense than this, (T, O,) 
A craft, or handicraft, by which one gains his 
subsistence; a mode, or manner, of gain; or 
any habitual work or occupation of a man; (T, O, 
Msb, K) as the sewing of skins or boots and the 
like; and the twisting of ropes; and the 
weaving, or plaiting, of palm-leaves; and the 
culture of palm-trees (J441I 3*4); and the 

pasturing of camels; and the like thereof; (T, O;) 
including the sowing, or tilling, of land: (TA:) or 
the of the Arabs was the management, or 
tending, of camels and of sheep and goats: and 
the term includes a man’s craft, or handicraft, or 
means of gain: (Sh, O:) and his traffic: (Sh, O, K:) 
one says to a man, ^ [Arise to thy craft,

should occupy himself with his proper craft, &c.] 
(Msb.) 4)11 Ls-ial, occurring in a trad., means 
God made or may God make, his means of 
subsistence to be abundant. (TA.) And one 
says, <“44= [or, more commonly,

said to mean His property was, or became, large, 
or abundant, [or wide-spread,] so that he was 
unable to collect it together: and [hence] his 
means of attaining his object [or his affairs (as in 
the TA in art. j4s)] became disordered so that he 
knew not with which of them to begin: (TA:) or 
he took to doing an affair that did not concern 
him: (TA, and Ham p. 33:) it is nearly like the

of jjj and (M:) and it is also 

pluralized, having for its pis. and u'- 4 “= (S,

The sixteenth letter of the alphabet; called 4= 
[and 4b the I of which is reduced to lS [as its 
radical letter]: when you spell it, you make its 
final letter quiescent; but when you apply an 
epithet to it, and make it a noun, you decline it as 
a noun, saying, [for instance,] 44 4= 4 [This 
is a tall J=>]: it is one of the letters 

termed » 44-“ [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the 
voice, and not with the breath only]; and of the 
letters termed b*4 like cii and A 
because originating from the [q. v.] of the 
roof of the mouth. (TA.) It is substituted for 
the cii in the measure 4*4 and the forms 
inflected therefrom, and [sometimes] for the 
pronominal cj, when immediately following any 
of the palatal letters [o^ and b 3 and and 4; 
(MF, TA;) as in [j 44 and and jbl 

and 44, for 441 and Mjilal and 44 and 44; 
and in] kbki and and 4* and bhjk , 

for ciibki and cjb=, and 41-4 and cjbik; but 
some of the grammarians say that this 
[latter] substitution is not to be made invariably; 
[nor is it common;] and it is said to be a dialectal 
peculiarity of some of the Benoo-Temeem. (TA.) 
It is also substituted for thus Yaakoob 
mentions, on the authority of As, — “ bi, 
for t-sjjkll and AO, bib, for 1 jjaII; and Aboo- 
'Amr Ez-Zahid, in the Yawakeet, 44 4 li, 
for -4- 1 4 U. (TA.) — [As a numeral, it denotes 
Nine.] b R. Q. 1 tL 4, inf. n. 4=4, He lowered, 
or depressed, a thing. (TA.) You say, bJ j bib He 
lowered his head; (S, K, TA;) and so i 44i, 
alone. (TA.) And =(4 jc. bb He lowered his 
head from the thing. (TA.) And J, “4 1 4 

diblb), (s, TA,) occurring in a trad, of 'Othman, 
(TA,) I stooped, or lowered myself, [or bent 
myself down,] to them, like as do the drawers of 
water with the bucket. (S, TA.) And J, 4bVi UJ 
443, a prov., (Meyd, TA,) meaning Stoop thy 
head to it, i. e. to an accident, or a calamity, and it 
will [miss thee, or] pass by thee: applied in 
relation to the abstaining from exposing oneself 
to evil. (Meyd.) And Ujij 4b4 (tropical:) She 
(a woman) lowered her veil, or curtain. (TA.) 
And gbb 4 44 He lowered his hand with the 
rein, for the purpose of [the horse's] running and 


hastening. (K, * TA.) And [hence, 

perhaps,] bb He struck his horse with his 
thighs, to make him go quickly. (K, * TA.) 
And 4^ a* 4b (assumed tropical:) He lowered 
the reputation, or estimation, or dignity, of such 
a one. (TA.) — — He hastened, or was quick. 
(TA.) You say, bU 44 He hastened, and 
exceeded the usual bounds, in the expenditure of 
his property. (A, K, TA.) And 4 44 He 
hastened, and exceeded the usual bounds, in 
their slaughter. (TA.) — — And He filled up a 
hollow, or cavity, dug in the ground. (TA.) R. Q. 
2 44; it was, or became, low, or depressed. (S, 
O.) It (the head) was, or became, lowered. (K.) 
See also the first paragraph, in three places. One 
says also, 4 bbUb Jj4 [app. 

meaning (assumed tropical:) He domineered

treated medically, therapeutically, or curatively, 
(O, * Msb, K, *) another person (O, Msb) [or the

each bb, and, accord, to analogy, the aor. of the

from what follows it seems probable that one 
says also ebb in the same sense, aor. 3-4=.

rectifying thyself. (ISk, TA. [See also Freytag's 
Arab. Prov. ii. 902.]) — — And 

[hence] bb signifies also (assumed tropical:) He 
acted with skill, or expertness: [and in this sense 
likewise the second pers. is probably 44= 
and ebb and ebb, of which last the inf. n. is 
app. bib, occurring in one of the phrases here 
following:] so in the saying, jb bb -bib] 

bb i. e. (assumed tropical:) Do thou it in the 
manner of him who acts with skill, or expertness, 
for him whom he loves: a prov., relating to 
the accomplishing an object of want skilfully and 
well. (El-Ahmar, TA. [See also Freytag's Arab. 
Prov. i. 717.]) One says also, 4b lb j jb-l

(assumed tropical:) He who loves is skilful, or 
intelligent, and exercises art, or ingenuity, 
for him whom he loves: (Meyd:) or (assumed 
tropical:) he who loves executes affairs with 
deliberateness and gentleness. (K.) [That one 
says 44, as well as 44 and 44, seems to be 
indicated by the fact that 1 bib, as an inf. n., is 
thus written, in a copy of the KL in my 
possession, and expl. as meaning The medical 
art: Golius, however, appears to have found it 
written, in a copy of the same work, . bib, which 
is agreeable with analogy as inf. n. of a verb of the 
measure (4 significant of an art, and is probably 
correct: Freytag mentions the pi. > 44 as 
signifying medical arts, on the authority of the 

Deewan of the Hudhalees.] -4 also signifies

of the two abodes [Paradise or Hell]: or, accord, 
to Ibn-Abi-1- Hadeed, it means [ye shall

the authority of IAb: (TA:) some read 3434,

mount upon stage after stage of the stages (34=*) 
of heaven; and IAb and Ibn-Mes-ood read 3434,

The extremity, or end, of anything; [as of a 
sword, and of a spear, and of a rope, and of the 
tongue, &c.;] thus accord, to ISd; but in the K this 
meaning is assigned to j (TA: 

[several evidences of the correctness of the 
former word in this sense will be found in the 
present art.; and countless instances of it occur in 
other arts. &c.: it seems to have been generally 
regarded by the lexicographers as too notorious 
to need its being mentioned:]) and a side; a 
lateral, or an outward, or adjacent, part or 
portion; a region, district, quarter, or tract; 
syn. (S, O, Msb, K:) and a part, portion, 
piece, or bit, (syn. <a)U=,) of a thing: (S, O, K:) it is 
used in relation to bodies, or material things, and 
to times &c.; (Er-Raghib, TA;) and is thus used in 
the sense of of a people, in the Kur iii. 122; 
(Ksh;) [and may often be rendered somewhat of a 
thing, whether material (as land &c.) or not 
material (as in the T and S voce j jj, where it is 
used of a saying, and as in the S and A and K in 
art. &c., where it is used of madness, or 
insanity, or diabolical possession):] the pi. 
is ‘-iljlal. (o, Msb, K.) — — 

[Hence,] J jWI signifies The fingers: and [when 
relating to the fingers] has no sing, unless this is 
used as a prefixed noun, as in the saying cjjlil 
u jly [she made a sign with the end of her 
finger]: but the pi. is said by Az to be used in the 
sense of the sing, in the following ex. cited 
by Fr, [so that the meaning is, 

They show an elegant finger like a fruit of the 
species of tree called (*£]; therefore the poet 
says [which is a n. un.: but I think that it 
is much more reasonable, and especially as the 
verb is pi., to regard the » in this case as the » of 
pausation, of which see an ex. voce u *?■; 
and accordingly to render the saying, they show 
elegant fingers like fruits of the jU]. (TA.) It is 
said in a trad, of Abraham, when he was a little 
child, [His sustenance was 

made to be in his fingers]; meaning that he used 
to suck his fingers and find in them that which 

nourished him. (TA.) And [hence] 

,_5 jlixll (tropical:) A species of grapes, (A, K, TA,) 
white and slender, found at Et-Taif: (A, TA:) or, 
as in the L, black and long, resembling acorns, 
likened to the fingers of virgins, that are dyed

bunch of which is about a cubit long. (TA.)

(O, K, TA,) so it is said, (O, TA,) it smites, and it 
suffers not him whom it smites to linger, killing 
at once. (O, K, TA.) — — 

sometimes means The fore part and the hinder 

part of the beast. (TA.) And :U=JI jLi (O)

Ul [It was the case that when any one of his 
family had a complaint, the cooking-pot did not 
cease to be on the fire but he arrived at one of his

convalescence or death; because these are the 
two terminations of the case of the diseased. (O, 

K.) And one says, V (assumed

mouth and his anus: referring to him who has 
drunk medicine or become intoxicated. (AO, ISk, 
S, O, K.) — — And i-'-a (assumed

that of his mother (O, K, TA) in respect of 
generosity, or nobility: (O, TA:) i. e., which of his 
two parents is the more generous, or noble: so 

says Fr. (TA.) gi® means (tropical:)

in respect of male and female ancestors. (S, O, 
TA.) — — And Jjk) means also (assumed

See the latter of these words.) And hence, as 
some explain it, the saying in the Kur [xiii. 41, 
like one in xxi. 45], gi. jVI Jp lii 1 } jj 

(assumed tropical:) [Have they not seen 


that we visit, or bring destruction upon, the land, 
curtailing it of its learned men?]; the meaning 
being, the death of its learned men: (O, TA:) or, 
as some say, [curtailing it of its inhabitants and 
its fruits; for they say that] the meaning is, the 
death of its inhabitants and the diminution of its 
fruits: (TA:) or it means, curtailing it of its sides, 
or districts, one by one: (Az, O, L:) Ibn-'Arafeh 
says that the meaning is, we lay open by 
conquest, to the Prophet, (i^l ^ jyiii,) the 

country around Mekkeh. (O, TA.) [ Ulgi>i 

g«ul also means (assumed tropical:) The lower 
orders of the people: but this I believe to be post- 
classical.] — — Jiill in the Kur xi. 116, 

means uU j [i. e. Morning and afternoon]; 

by the former being meant daybreak; and by the 
latter, noon and the [q. v.], (Ksh, Bd,) or 
the [only]. (Bd.) And UlgLi ; in the Kur 
xx. 130, means At daybreak and at sunset: (Ksh, 
Bd:) or at noon and at the so says Zj: or,

aside, or apart; like and ■u'- 5 Jc- : and in 

like manner the Persians say UgL j). — —

though it had two ends, or two sides]. (TA

tropical:) [He made it allowable, or free, in 
respect of both the alternatives, either way one

[And hence, perhaps,] UgU signifies also 
(assumed tropical:) Anything chosen or choice: 
pi. [whence] UUll Ul gLI means (assumed 

tropical:) Chosen, or choice, subjects of 
discourse; as also UlgL j. UU1I : and ■ — 
iy.2U.VI means [the same, or] colloquies of 
friends, consisting of mutual communications, 
and oblique expressions, and allusions: so 
says ISd: and this is likewise a meaning of

signifying “ mutual reviling ”] is given in the K as 
an explanation of the former. (TA.) — — Also

nature of stones, and of [what are termed]

As] heard that it is called lkG*' and 

therefore supposed it to be a plant; for if it were a 
plant, fire would burn it; but fire does not burn it,

circular panes which are inserted in apertures to 
admit light,] for the [cupolas of] hot 
baths, instead of glass: the best is that of El- 
Yemen; then that of India; then that of El- 


Undulus [or El-Andalus]: the art employed in 
dissolving it consists in putting it into a piece of 
rag with some pebbles and immersing it in tepid 
water, then moving it about gently until 
it becomes dissolved and comes forth from the 
piece of rag into the water, whereupon the water 
is strained from it, and it is put in the sun to dry.

accord, to Lth and IF, means ^

hemistich; but an Arab of the desert, in reciting 
this verse to As, is related to have said 3^* 
[which equally completes the hemistich]: and the 
Basrees hold that the sign of the fern, gender is 
elided in 3^* because it is a possessive epithet, 

meaning 3 [having divorce]. (Msb.)

the unaugmented verb has the signification first 
assigned to it, or “ her discharge of blood 
stopped: ” (Abu-1- Abbas, IAar:) in the Kur

account of the difference between the two forms 
of the verb, just mentioned: (Abu-1- Abbas:) or 
the law which allows not the touching a woman

rather among epithets, (MF, TA,) of with

of 44, (k,) accord, to Kr, who says that there is 
no word like it except 4“ 4 pi- of 44, and 4 
pi. of 44=; but ISd says that, in his opinion, ^4= 
and es-'jS and 44= are ferns, of and 44 
and 34==', because 4*^ is not a pi. measure: Kr 
also adds that they did not say \ ^4=, like as 
they said es-4 and 44=; (TA; [see ,44=, in 
art. 34=;]) [but Sgh says that] J. ^=4= is a dial. var. 
of (O:) Aboo-Hatim Sahl Ibn-Mohammad 
Es-Sijistanee relates that an Arab of the desert, 
reciting as a pupil to him, persisted in 
pronouncing 44= for ^4=: (TA:) it signifies 4=*= 
[as meaning A good final, or ultimate, state or 
condition]: and (some say, O, Msb) 34- [meaning 
good, good fortune, and the like]: (O, Msb, K:) 
and [meaning God's blessing or favour, &c.]; 
(K;) as some say: (TA:) or eternal life: (Zj, TA:) or 
a pleasant life: (Msb:) and (O, K) a certain tree in 
Paradise; (S, O, K;) thus the Prophet is related to 
have said; and MF says that it is a proper name 
thereof, not admitting the article J], and the like 
is said in the M: (TA:) or it signifies Paradise in 
the Indian language; (O, K;) or, accord, to Sa'eed 
Ibn-Jubeyr, in the Abyssinian language: (O:) as 
also [ ^*4=. (K.) These different significations are 
assigned by different persons to this word in 
the phrase in the Kur [xiii. 28] f4 ^4= [which 
seems to be best rendered as an announcement, 
meaning A good final state, &c., shall be to 
them, or be their lot]: (Msb, TA:) Sb holds that it 
is an invocation of good, or a prayer, [as 
though 3 J. e. “ say thou ” were understood 
before it,] and that ^4= is virtually in the nom. 
case, i. e. £ 44“, as is shown by the words 
immediately following is^-j: but Th, who 
makes ^4= to he an inf. n. like ^^<4 j, says that 
one reading is 4"“ 3=4 f4 44=, like the 
phrase <1 4*= : MF, however, [supposing Th to 
have said ^4=, though I think it indubitable that 
he said ^4=, and only meant that it was used as 
virtually, not literally, with tenween,] 
observes that ty-4 j, with tenween, is not known 
to have been transmitted from any one of the 
leading authorities on the Arabic language. (TA.) 


Katadeh says that ^4= is a phrase of the 
Arabs; who say, c£*i jt 31! ^4= [A good 

final state &c., be to thee, or he thy lot, or shall 
he to thee, if thou do such and such things]: and 
it is said in a trad., 4-41 ^4= [May good, &c., 
betide Syria]; in which case, ^4= is of 
the measure J*® from ==4=1', and does not mean “ 
Paradise,” nor “ the tree. ” (L, TA.) One says, ^4= 
41 and ‘^44=; (S, K;) but not 434=: (Yaakoob, S, 
O: [in one of my copies of the S 4^4=:]) or 41)4= 
is a barbarism: (O, K:) it is disallowed by the T, 
and by most of the grammarians: but Akh says 
that it is used by some of the Arabs; and Ibn-El- 
Moatezz uses it in the following verse: % ==4“

and hence fortune, whether good or evil, is 
called 33. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur [vii.

fortune, which will overtake them, is only that

the cause of their good and evil is only with God;

her own, (S, M, Mgh, K,) and to suckle it; (M, K;) 
as also i ij'kl ; and i l* JMk : (K:) and [it is also 
said that] jkk signifies the making a she-camel to 
incline to, or to affect, and suckle, the young one 
of another, by the application of a kUi fo her 
nose, (S, * K, * TA,) i. e. by stopping her nose, 
and also her eyes, (TA,) and by the insertion of 
a kjj [q. v.] composed of rags into her vulva, 
(^j, T, TA, or elk., S), and closing its [i. e. the 
vulva's] edges by means of two pointed pieces of 
wood stuck through, and putting upon her a kUi 
covering her head, and leaving her in this state 
until it distresses her, (T, TA,) and she imagines 
herself to be in labour; (TA;) when the <=>• j-i is 
pulled out from her vulva (« 4 k), and the young 


one of another is brought near to her, having its 
head and skin bedaubed with what has come 
forth with the 3 -?. from the lower part of the 
vulva; (T, * TA;) then they open her nose and her 
eyes; (TA;) and when she sees and smells the 
young one, she imagines that she has brought it 
forth, and yields it milk: moreover, when the <=>■ 
is inserted, the space between the two edges of 
her vulva is closed by a thong [passed round the 
extremities of the two pointed pieces of wood]. 
(T, TA.) It is said in a trad., of 'Omar, (T,) or Ibn- 
'Omar, (S, TA,) that he purchased a she-camel,

approve it: or the reading of the S is i » jik. (TA.) 
The Arabs also said, gjs jkk jikll (M, K) 
Thrusting, or piercing, with the spear is a means 
of inclining a people to peace; (K;) meaning, 
make people to fear, that they may love thee. (M,

she swallows]; and it is thus cited [in the T and] 
in the “ Basair ” of the author of the K. (TA.) The 
phrase jik in the Kur vi. 147 comprises 

camels and ostriches; (so in the T and TS and L; 
but in the K, fUiVI is erroneously put for 
TA;) because their are like jl*i=l to them: (T, 
K, TA:) I’Ab says that it comprises camels; and 
also ostriches, because they have nails like 
camels: or any bird that has a ‘ .'A ? , and any beast 
that has a solid hoof: or, accord, to Mujahid 
and Katadeh, every beast and bird that has not 
divided toes; as the camel and ostrich and goose

to have mentioned in this sense any term

the author of the 'Eyn,] is said only of a thing that 
is done in the day, or daytimes; (T, S, M, O, 
Msb;) like as P, aor. pi, is said only of a thing 
that is done in the night: (T:) it is an incomplete 
[i. e. a non-attributive] verb, relating to a time in 
which is a shade from the sun, from morning to 
evening, or from sunrise to sunset: (Esh-Shihab, 
TA:) one says, » jP pa P [Such a one was 
during his day fasting; or he passed his day 
fasting]: (Lth, T:) and P pj P [He was in, 
or during, his day doing such a thing; or he 
passed his day doing such a thing]: (M, K:) 
and Pd [I was in the day or daytime, or I 
passed the day, doing such a thing; or] I did such 
a thing in the day or daytime. (S, O, Msb. *) 
In the saying of 'Antarah, Pi j lS pi jc. cp 2 j 
JSlill JLi pi. [app. meaning And verily I 

pass the night in hunger, and I pass the day in it, 
that I may attain thereby plentiful eating], Pi is

P occurs in poetry; (M, K, TA;) so that one 
says, JP P P [He was in, or during, his 
night, or he passed his night, doing such a thing]: 
but it is said that in this case the verb has the 
meaning next following. (TA.) — — And it 
signifies also He, or it, became; syn. jP (Er- 
Raghib, TA:) being in this sense likewise an 
incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb, divested 
of that meaning of time which it radically 
denotes; as in the phrase in the Kur [xvi. 6o and 
xliii. 16], 1 - 0 "“ Pj P [His face becomes black]: 
so says Ibn-Malik: (TA:) or this may mean his 
face continues all the day black: (Bd in xvi. 6o:) 
and one says also, la£ J*L p meaning He 
continued doing such a thing: this too is 
mentioned by Ibn-Malik, and is of the dial, of the 

people of Syria. (TA.) It is also a complete [i. 

e. an attributive] verb as meaning He, or 
it, continued; as is said in the Expos, of the “ 
Shife,” and by Ibn-Malik; and, as Ibn-Malik 
likewise says, it was, or became, long. (TA.)

K,) shady, or a day having shade: (S, M, O, K:) or 
it was a day having clouds, or other [causes 
of shade]: (T:) or it was continually shady; as also

thee, and cast its shade upon thee. (Mgh.) 

[Hence,] Pi (assumed tropical:) He took 
him into his shelter, or protection: (TA:) or he 
guarded, or protected, him, and placed him 
within the scope of his might, or power of 
resistance or defence. (Er-Raghib, TA.)- — 

And (assumed tropical:) It (a thing) 

covered me: (M, K:) or it approached me, or drew 
near to me, so as to cast its shade upon me: (K:) 
or it has both of these meanings: (M:) or P>i 
means he, (T, S,) or it, (O,) approached thee, or 
drew near to thee, as though he, or it, cast his, or 
its, shade upon thee. (T, S, O.) And hence one 
says, P P=i (assumed tropical:) An 
event approached thee, or drew near to thee: (S, 
O:) and in like manner one says of a month. (T, S, 
O.) And Pi [alone] (assumed tropical:) It 
(a thing) advanced: or approached, or drew near.

tropical:) He, or it, became within sight,

It is also pronounced p: (IAar, T:) and signifies

Pi L, (Msb, TA,) He (a man, T) sheltered, or

fpl The grape-vine became luxuriant, or 
abundant and dense, in its branches whereon

Shade; i. e. the light of the sun without the rays:

contr. of jP»: (M, K:) or i. q. (K:) so some 
say: (M:) or so the [common] people say: (IKt, 
Msb:) or the former is [shade] in the morning; 
and the latter is in the evening: (M, K:) or, 
accord, to IKt, the former is in the morning and 
in the evening; but the latter is only after the 
declining of the sun from the meridian: ISk says 
that the former is from the rising of the sun to its 
declining; and the latter, from the declining to 
the setting: Th says that the P of a tree &c. is in 
the morning; and the in the evening: (Msb:) 
Ru-beh says, (M, Msb,) any place, (M,) or any 
thing, (Msb,) upon which the sun has been and 
which it has quitted is termed P and (M, 
Msb;) but a thing [or place] upon which the sun 
has not been is termed P [only]; and hence it is 
said that the sun annuls, or supersedes, the P, 
and the annuls, or supersedes, the sun: 
(Msb:) AHeyth says, the P is anything 
upon which the sun has not come; and the 
term is applied only after the declining of the 
sun; the being eastwards and the P 
being westwards; and the P being termed P 
from the beginning of the day to the declining of 
the sun; after which it is termed until the 
night: (T, TA:) one says the P of Paradise, but 
not its because the sun will never replace 
its P; but En-Nabighah El-Jaadee has assigned 
to Paradise * 3 * having Jp: (M, TA:) in a verse of 
Aboo-Sakhr EIHudhalee, P is made fem. as 
meaning P [i. e. death]: (Ham p. 161:) the pi. 
[of mult.] is 3 P (S, M, O, K) and 3 P and [of 
pauc.] C)Pi. (M, O, K.) The saying of a rajiz, LP 
P- P PP [As though thy face were a 
shade of a stone] is said to mean hardness of 
face, and shamelessness: or the being black in the 
face: (T, TA:) for the Arabs say that there 
is nothing more dense in shade than a stone. 
(TA.) P ja [His shade, or shadow, has 
become sun] is said of the dead. (TA.) P P j* 
yj- P [He passed by us as though he were the 
shadow of a wolf] means swiftly, as does a wolf.

unbelievers is a way of attaining to Paradise. 
(Marg. note in a copy of the “ Jami’ es- 
Sagheer.) ^ Mc-iU is an appellation of A certain 
bird; [see art. s=J;] and one says '- i $H= 4?3i; 
and t>lf= ciiUcMi: hut when you make 

them indeterminate, you say 3$l3Jii CiUcMi. (T, 
O, K. [But in the TA in art. m* 1, it is said that one 
dualizes and pluralizes both nouns, because 

the appellation becomes determinate.]) 31= 

3P means (tropical:) The blackness of the night: 
(T, S, O, Msb;) metaphorically thus termed; (S;) 
as in the saying, 33H 31= ^ 44i [He came to us in 
the blackness of the night]: (S, O:) or it 
signifies 3=111 jii [app. as meaning the darkness, 
and confusedness, of the night; see 4-3=]; (M, TA;) 
or so 31=11: (K:) or this means the night, (M, K, 
TA,) itself; (M, TA;) so the astronomers say: 
(TA:) all the night is 31=: and so is all the 
period from the shining of the dawn to the rising 

of the sun. (T.) j43l 31= is The colour of the 

day when the sun predominates over it 
[app. meaning when the light of the sun 
predominates over that of the early dawn]. (K.) — 
_ =-A=3JI 33 means Such, of the clouds, as 

conceal the sun: or the blackness of the clouds. 

(M, K.) And .3411 33li means The waves of 

the sea; (O, K, TA;) because they are raised so as 
to shade the ship and those that are in it. (TA.) — 
— 31= also signifies A 344 (M, O, K) that is seen, 
(M, K,) [i. e. an apparition, a phantom, or a thing 
that one sees like a shadow, i. e. what we term a 
shade,] of the jinn, or genii, and of others: (M, O, 

K:) or the like of a 344 of the jinn. (T.) Also 

Anything that shades one. (TA.) And it is 

the subst. from =3311 ^4113 meaning “ the thing 
covered me; ” (M, K;) [i. e. it means A covering;] 
in which sense Th explains it in the phrase 31= J! 
===-4 4=3= is) [in the Kur lxxvii. 30, Unto a 
covering having three parts, or divisions]; saying, 
the meaning is that the fire will have covered 
them; not that its 31= will be like that of the 
present world. (M. [See 33A]) And =3-411 31= 
means (assumed tropical:) That which serves for 
the veiling, covering, or protecting, of the thing; 
syn. (M.) [Hence] one says, 31= ^ 344 u35 
g3l i. e. (assumed tropical:) [Such a one lives] in 
the shelter, or protection, of such a one. (T, * S, 
O, Msb, * K. *) And i3=j^ J & 34, jlLLlI, (o, 
TA,) a saying of the Prophet, (O,) [meaning 
(assumed tropical:) The sovereign, or 
ruling, power is God’s means of defence in the 
earth,] because he wards off harm from the 
people like as the 31= [properly so called] wards 
off the harm of the heat of the sun: (TA:) or the 
meaning is, (assumed tropical:) God's means of 


protection: or God's 34=13. [or special servant]. (O, 
TA.) — — Also (assumed tropical:) Might; or 
power of resistance or defence: (M, K, TA:) 
whence [as some say] its usage in the Kur xiii. 
35, and the usage of [the pi.] 333 in xxxvi. 56 and 
in lxxvii. 41: [but the primary signification is 
more appropriate in these instances:] and so 
in the saying, <14" ^ =. 5=34. [i. e. (assumed 
tropical:) He placed me within the scope of his 
might, or power of resistance or defence]: so says 

Er-Raghib. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:) A 

state of life ample in its means or circumstances, 
unstraitened, or plentiful, and easy, pleasant, 
soft, or delicate. (TA.) — — Also (assumed 
tropical:) The beginning of winter. (T, O. 
[Accord, to the copies of the K, of youthfulness: 
but I think that m 441I in this instance, in the K, 
is evidently a mistranscription for =4311.]) And 
(assumed tropical:) The vehemence (T, O, K) of 

the heat (T, O) of summer. (T, O, K.) Also 

(assumed tropical:) The [ a g meaning 

person of a human being, and as meaning the 
bodily or corporeal form or figure or substance 
which one sees from a distance, or the material 
substance,] of anything; (M, K, TA; [in the 
second and third of which is added, “or its 34,” 
a signification which I have mentioned above on 
the authority of the M;]) because of its [apparent] 
blackness [or darkness, resembling that of 
a shade or shadow]: (M, TA:) whence the 
saying, jjlij V (assumed tropical:) [My 

person will not quit thy person]; like the 
saying, 41-43= ^=13 = 3j 4= V: and the following exs. 
have been cited as instances of 3j= in the sense 
of the saying of a poet, 3=34 3t> 4*a j 41 ji 14! 
[as though meaning When we alighted, we raised 
the material fabric of tents], for it is said that they 
do not set up the 3j= which is the =3*, but they 
only set up the tents; and the saying of 
another, 344c 33141 =tal j4== [as though meaning 
He followed the shadows of the material objects 
in the evening]: but Er-Raghib says that the 
former means, we raised the tents, and so raised 
the 34 thereof; and in the other ex., 314-141 is a 
general term, and =3^ [or =4il] is a special term, 
so that it is an instance of the 34Ui| of a thing to 
its kind [i. e. of prefixing a noun to one 

significant of its kind]. (TA.) [See also 3433.] 

And accord, to Ibn- 'Abbad, (O,) it signifies also 
The nap, or villous substance, upon the surface of 
a garment, or piece of cloth; syn. j=i j. (O, K.) 3Hi 
i. q. 3-tlaJ [Continuance, residence, abode, &c.]. 
(K.) — — And i. q. 3A-^ : thus accord, to the 
copies of the K; but this may be a 
mistranscription; for Az and others 
mention, among the significations of 3Jk, [in a 
copy of the T, written in this case, as in others,

and a thing by which one is protected from the 
cold and the heat: (M:) anything that protects 
and shades one, as a building or a mountain or 
a cloud: (Mgh:) the first portion that shades (AZ, 
S, K) of a cloud (AZ, S) or of clouds; (K;) accord, 
to Er-Raghib, mostly said of that which 
is deemed unwholesome, and which is disliked; 
whence the use of the word in the Kur vii. 170 : 
(TA:) and what shades one, of trees: (K:) or 
anything that forms a covering over one, (T, TA,) 
or shades one: (T:) and [particularly] a thing like

one protects himself from the heat and the cold: 
(K:) or, accord, to the lawyers, J31I 4k means 
the sJ- [or projecting roof] over the door of the

upon the house and the other end upon the wall 
of the opposite neighbour: (Mgh:) pi. Jk= (S, M,

also, Jkll 4k ciiilj and 44k [ Jk3, meaning That

they collected themselves together, seeking 
protection thereby from the heat that came upon 
them, whereupon it covered them, (T, * K, TA,)

Kur [xxxix. 18 ], means To them shall be above 
them coverings of fire, and beneath them 
coverings to those below them; Hell consisting of 
stages, one beneath another. (T, TA.) Seditions, 
or conflicts and factions, are mentioned in a trad, 
as being like Jlk, by which are meant Mountains, 
and clouds: and El-Kumeyt likens waves of the 
sea to Jit. (TA.) And [the pi.] Jlk is used 
as meaning The chambers of a prison. (M, TA.) — 
See also 4k. 4k i. q. J4k; (T, K, TA;) app. a pi.

Constant shade: (S:) or extensive shade: (O:) or

the phrase Je'-i (TA.) 4Jk ilt in the Kur iv. 
60 is said by Er-Raghib to be an allusion to ease

evidently a mistranscription.]) Jki [More, and

subst., i. e. Jki accord, to a general rule, or, if 
regarded as originally an epithet, it may 
be Jki,] by poetic license Jiki, (S, M, O, K,)

of its being concealed: (AHei, TA:) and, (M, K,) in 
a human being, (M,) JkVI signifies ijkj; 

(M, K;) and [ISd says] this is in my opinion the 
right explanation; but it is said that Jki 

signifies Ojkl, which means the portion, of 

what is next to the fore part [of the bottom] of the 
foot, from the root of the great toe to the root of 
the little toe, of the human being: (M:) the pi. 
is Jk, which is anomalous, (M, K,) or formed 
after the manner of the pi. of an epithet: (M:)

thou]. (S in art. 14 ^ 4>] (A 4 means I thought of 
him, or it, such a thing: and I thought such

God, various thoughts]. (M.) Accord, to Sb, 41k

the verb denotes a state of mind between 
doubt and certainty, but the latter is 
predominant: and hence 4 sometimes means 
He doubted: and sometimes, he knew, by 
considering with endeavour to understand, not

A'Obeyd: (T:) or, as some relate it, the word

meaning He is suspected of such a thing. (TA in

an inference from a sign, or mark, or token; when 
strong, leading to knowledge; and when weak, 
not exceeding the limit of 4 : (Er-Raghib, TA:)

meaning also; (Er-Raghib, TA;) contr. of 4:

knowledge, or certainty, 04, T, M,) such as is 
obtained by considering with endeavour to

more common:]) as a subst., (TA,) its pi. is o4 
and u4>l, (M, K, TA,) the latter anomalous, or 
(as ISd says, TA) it may be pi. of J, ^ 4', but this

placed in him. (TA.) <ik Suspicion, or evil 
opinion; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also 4; 
the being changed into -4 though there is 
no in this case, because of their being 
accustomed to say 4=! [for 4=!, which is 
for 0 “!]; an instance like jS4l, which is made to 
accord with 4 ! [for 4!, which is for 44 as 
mentioned by Sb; (M;) and J, (so accord, to 
a copy of the M,) or j like <44, (TA,) 

signifies the same: (M, TA:) the pi. of <4 is u4 
(S, K.) One says, ^4“ “4 and ^*4 3*, meaning 
He is the place [i. e. object] of my suspicion. (TA.)

evil (S, M) of everyone. (M.) — — A man

(M:) [or] J, o4 has this latter meaning. (TA.) — 
— A man in whose goodness no trust, or 
confidence, is to be placed. (M.) And Anything in 
which no trust, or confidence, is to be placed, 
(M, TA,) of water, and of other things; (TA;) as 
also l o4. (M, TA.) A well (4) having little 
water, (S, M, K,) in the water of which no trust, or 
confidence, is to be placed: (M:) or a well, (S, K,) 
or a drinkingplace, (M,) of which one knows not 
whether there be in it water or not: (S, M, K:) or 
water which one imagines, or supposes, to 
exist, but of which one is not sure. (TA.) <4 ^ 
u 4 is a saying mentioned, but 
not expl., by IAar; [app. meaning Every death is 
doubtful as to its consequence except slaughter in 
the way, or cause, of God; but ISd says,] in my 
opinion the meaning is that it is of little good and 
profit. (M.) o4 4 means A debt of which one 
knows not whether he who owes it will pay it or 
not: (A'Obeyd, T, S, M, * K:) it is said in a trad, of 
'Omar that there is no poorrate in the case 

of such a debt. (TA.) Also A man suspected 

in relation to his intellect, or intelligence. (Aboo-

not suspected as to what he makes known from 
God, of the knowledge of that which is 
undiscoverable, as is related on the authority of 
'Alee: or, accord, to Fr, it may mean 

weak; for 44 may have this meaning like as o4 
has: (T:) some read 44- (TA in art. 4 s , q.

which two and the first are the most commonly 
known of all the many pis. of 4, (Msb,) 
being like 44 s as pi. of 4 s , a rare form of pk; (S, 
O;) or, accord, to some, it is a quasipl. n.; accord, 
to Ibn-Malik, 34 occurs as a pi. measure, but 
sometimes they use it in the manner of a pi. and 
make it fem., as in the instance of 4-, and 
sometimes they use it in the manner of quasi-pl. 
ns. and make it masc., as in the instances 
of and 44 s ; (MF;) [accord, to the general 
and more approved opinion, it is a quasi-pl. n., 
and therefore fem. and masc., but most 
commonly fem.;] and further it should be 
remarked that the common people agree in 
making a difference between -4 and 4, by the 
former meaning slaves [and by the latter 
meaning servants of God and also simply, with 
the article <J, mankind], saying, 4 jc these 
are slaves, and 411 4 4° >4, [this is a servant, 

of the servants of God]: (Az, L:) [and a 
distinction is also made between -4? and “44

last three of which are also pis. of 4: (L:) one 
says of the worshippers of a plurality of gods, f* 
Cijilill ojjc [they are the servants of Et-Taghoot]; 
but the Muslims one calls 4, meaning the 
servants, or worshippers, of God: (Lth, L:) [all 
these are pis. in the proper sense of the term, of 
the broken class:] and Oj4, (O, K,) a pi. of the 
sound class, adopted because 4° is originally an 
epithet: (TA:) and [the following, with the 
exception of the first, and of some which are 
particularized as being pis. of pis., are also said to 
be pis., but are properly speaking quasi-pl.

read [in the Kur ubi supra] cjjilkll .ue, making 
the former a prefixed noun, as meaning the 
servants (4.) of Et-Taghoot; but it is a n. of the 
measure <3*4 like (4 and 44 not a pi.; the 
meaning being the servant 44 of Et- 
Taghoot; (Akh, S, O;) and it is also used by poetic 
license for 4; (Fr, T, S, O;) and 1 u4 and 
1 44 and i lS 4; (S, O, K;) or, accord, to 
some, the last of these signifies slaves born in a 
state of slavery; and the female is termed i “4 ;

of slaves born in a state of slavery, generation 
after generation; but Az says that this is a 
mistake, that 411 <j4 signifies the same 

as 411 4, that it is thus used in a trad., and 


that ls 4 is applied in another trad, to poor men

The disdainers, or scorners, and the angry: (S, * 
L:) but Ibn-'Arafeh rejects this assertion: (TA:) 
these words are variously explained; as meaning 
There is not to the Compassionate a son; and I 
am the first of the angry disdainers or scorners of 
the assertion that there is: or, and I am the first 
of the deniers of this assertion: or, and I am the

God of this people: or if there were to the 
Compassionate a son, I would be the first of his 
worshippers: or if there be to the Compassionate 
a son, I am the first of worshippers; but I am not 
the first worshipper of God: or, accord, to Az, the 
best interpretation is one ascribed to Mujahid; i. 
e. if there be to the Compassionate a son in your 
opinion, I am the first of those who have 
worshipped God alone, and who have thus 
charged you with uttering a falsehood in this your 
assertion. (L.) “4: see 4, latter half. “4 [as a

that it abounds with milk: (O:) it is also said to be 
a tree [or plant] that grows by the burrow of the

does not increase; whence the saying 4 3=1 4

applied in this sense to a man: (S:) and 
the former, applied to a stallion [camel], 
vociferous, or noisy, in his braying: and, applied

Msb, K,) which two are syn. each with the other, 
(S, O, K,) and with the first also; (S, K;) all signify 
He wondered at it; i. e. he deemed it 
strange, extraordinary, or improbable, said of a 
thing occurring, or presenting itself, to him; (K, 
TA;) on account of his being little accustomed 
to it: (TA:) or the first signifies [as above, i. e.] he 
deemed it strange, extraordinary, or improbable: 
and 4 44 is of two kinds; one is [the wondering] 
at a thing which one commends, and it means the 
accounting (a thing) good or goodly, or approving 
[it], and expressing one's approval of a thing; and 
the other is at a thing that one dislikes, and it 
means the deeming [a thing] strange, 
extraordinary, or improbable, 

and discommending [it]: (Msb:) or, accord, to 
some of the grammarians, it signifies the mind's 
becoming affected, or acted upon, by some 
excessive quality in the thing by which it is so 
affected; [so that it may be rendered the 
becoming affected with wonder;] as when one 
says <»-4i [“ how courageous is he! ”] and j-4i 

44 1 j 4 [“ how clearly shall they hear! and how 
clearly shall they see! ”]: (Msb, MF, TA:) or it is 
[the wondering] at a thing of which the cause, or 
reason, is hidden, and not known: or it is when 
one sees a thing that pleases him, and thinks

that he has not seen the like of it: (L, TA:) 
[therefore *4 44 maybe rendered he wondered 
at it, and he admired it:] accord, to some, 
it peculiarly relates to what is deemed good or 
goodly, or approved; [though this is inconsistent 
with the application of the grammatical term 3*1 
4*111 the verb of wonder;] and the subst. derived 
from it is [ 44: and { *- .*4“ *' relates to what is 
good or goodly or approved, and to what is 
otherwise; and the subst. is [ 4=*° [which is also 
the inf. n. of 441 : or accord, to the A and L, 
[ * . '>»' '“ *1 signifies he wondered at a thing 
intensely; or became affected with intense 
wonder. (TA.) — — [4 44s a phrase of 

common occurrence, (mentioned in the K 
voce 44, &c.,) is for 4 44 I wonder 
greatly, lit. with wondering, at this. See also an 
ex. voce 4"^, last sentence but two.] — — Of 
the words in the Kur xxxvii. 12 , there are two 
readings, ujj 44 3) and ujj4j 4: 
accord, to the former, the meaning is, Nay, 
thou wonderest at their conduct, or deemest it 
extraordinary, [O Mohammad,] and they mock: 
respecting the latter reading, [which may be 
rendered Nay, I wonder, &c.,] it is observed 
that 4=^ when attributed to God has a meaning 
different from that which it has when attributed 
to men: IAth says that, when attributed to God, it 
is used in a tropical manner, as the causes of 
things are not hidden from Him: or, accord, to 
IAmb, the verb here meams I have recompensed 
them for their wondering at the truth, or their 
deeming it strange or improbable: and in like 
manner it is said [in the Kur viii. 30 ], j4jj uj 44 
[lit. “ They plot and God plotteth ”], meaning, 
“God recompenseth them for their plotting. ” (L, 
TA.) — — It is also said that 4=* t when 
attributed to God [sometimes] means The being 
well pleased, content, or satisfied. (K, TA.) The 
saying, in a trad., ^ 44 4 ! uj 4 jA 4 j 4 

means Thy Lord wonders at a people who 
will be led to Paradise in chains [because of their 
deeming themselves unworthy thereof]; the 
verb being here used in a tropical sense: or 
the meaning is, thy Lord is well pleased with, and 
will reward, a people &c.: and there are other 

trads. of the same kind. (L, TA.) 4! 4?^ 

means He loved, or liked, him, or it. (L, TA.) [See 
a verse cited voce 4.*>° ; from which it seems to 
signify lit. He, or it, was an object of love to him.] 
— 4*> c , inf. n. 4?*^; and 4*> c ; said of a she- 
camel, She was, or became, such as is 
termed *44 (TA.) 2 44, inf. n. 44, He caused 
him to wonder, (S, O, K, TA,) [by the 

thing]. (TA. [See also 4 .]) 4 4l it (a thing, or an 


affair, or event, TA) induced, or excited, him to 
wonder. (K, TA. [See also 2 .]) In the following 
saying of Ibn- Keys-er-Rukeiyat, 4“ 0 * 4 ' 4 4 j

444 the meaning is, [She saw upon my head 
some hoariness, which I did not hide; and she 
said to me, “Is this Ibn-Keys? ” somewhat of 
hoariness] causing her to have wonder. (TA.) — 
— And It (a thing, or an affair, or event, TA) 
induced in him wonder, or admiration, and 
pleasure, or joy: (K:) or it excited his admiration, 
or approval: (Msb:) or it pleased, or rejoiced, 
him. (TA.) You say, 4*41 1,4' 4 441 
[This thing has excited my admiration, or 
approval, or has pleased me, for its goodness, or 
goodliness, or beauty]. (S, O.) And *44 44^1 
[Its goodness, or goodliness, or beauty, excited

pleased with it, or rejoiced by it. (K.) You

is often used as syn. with 44, the corresponding 
subst.,] (O,) [He admired himself, (lit. was 
excited to admiration by himself,) was pleased 
with himself, or was self-conceited, or vain; or] 
he exalted, and magnified, himself; was haughty, 
and proud. (Msb.) — — [44 U generally 

signifies How wonderful is it!] *44 44' L* 

[How greatly does he admire his opinion or 
judgment! or how greatly is he pleased with it! or 
how conceited, or vain, or proud, is he of it!] 
is anomalous [in two respects], (S, O, K,) not to 
be taken as an example to be imitated; (S, O;) for 
the verb here is formed from a passive 
[and augmented] verb [44], like as is the case 
in 441 U; whereas it is the primary rule with 
respect to the verb of wonder that it shall not 
be formed from any but an active [and 
unaugmented] verb. (TA.) 5 4 see 1 , in two 

places. One says also, 44 4 4 [app. 

meaning He showed **-4 ; i. e. self- admiration, 
&c., in his gait]. (TA voce *"4) — 44" 

signifies 44" [He excited my desire, and 
invited me, or made me to incline, to ignorant, or 
foolish, or silly, and youthful, conduct, so that I 
yearned towards him: or he deceived me, or 
beguiled me, and captivated my heart]; (O, K, 
TA;) said of a man: (O, TA:) and 4“ [in the 

0 44 which I think a mistranscription, though 

1 do not find 4 elsewhere in the sense here 
assigned to it,] signifies the same. (TA.) 10 *4*41 
see 1 , in three places. 44: see 4=*°, in 
two places: — and see also 44. — Also The 
root, or base, of the tail: (S, O, K:) or the part of 


the root, or base, of the tail, of any beast, which 
the haunch encloses, (Msb, TA,) and which is 
inserted in the hinder part of the rump: (TA:) or 
the root, or base, and bone, of the tail: (Lh, TA:) 
also called the o-44c [q. v .]: (Msb, TA:) or it 
is the head of the o-44o: (TA:) or the upper part 
of the 4 *: or the external extremity of the 
spine; and the j*4 is its internal 
extremity: (Az, L voce j4a : ) it is said in a trad., 
that every part of a man will become consumed, 
except the 4, (TA,) or the m 4 of the tail, (O, 
TA,) accord, to different relations; (TA;) from 
which [as a rudiment] he was created, and upon 
which he will [at the resurrection] be put 
together: (O:) i. e. the bone at the lower, or 
lowest, part of the spine, at the rump; which is 
the >.; **>£* of beasts: it is said to be like a grain 
of mustard-seed: or, as Z says in the “ Faik,” it is 
the bone that is between the buttocks: it is also 
pronounced [ 44; and accord, to MF, J, 44, 
but no one else says this: and, as El-Khafajee 
says, it is also called f4 and f4 and f4, in this 

case with the three vowel-sounds. (TA.) Also 

(tropical:) The hinder part (S, O, K, TA) of a 
tract of sand, (S, O,) or of anything: (K, TA:) and 
hence, 4S y4 i. e. the thin hinder portion [of a 
sand-hill, or of an extended and gibbous sand- 
hill, or of a collection of sand that has poured 
down]: (TA:) pi. 4 j4, (S, O,) and perhaps 4*4' 
also in the former sense [and therefore in this 

likewise]. (TA.) 44: see 4t*^. Also a subst. 

from the phrase 4*4 * 4 *', (S,) or from 447'; 
(O;) [i. e. it signifies Self-admiration; or 
selfconceitedness; or] vanity; and pride: (K:) it is 
said to be [a result, or an offspring, of stupidity, 
or folly; or] a redundance of stupidity, or folly, 
which one has turned to what is thus termed. 
(TA.) [Er-Raghib makes a distinction 
between 44 and 4 ; as will be seen below, 
voce 44.] — Also, and J, 44, and j 44, A 
man who is pleased to sit with women, (O, K,) 
and to converse with them, without his doing 
what induces doubt, or suspicion, or evil 
opinion: (O:) or with whom women are pleased:

account of being little accustomed to it; (TA;) or

a distinction between 4* and [ 44, see l, in 
the middle of the paragraph: the pi. of 4?* [in 
this sense] is [said to he] 4l4l; (K;) or it has no 
pi.: (S, O, K:) [this statement correctly applies 
to 44 as an epithet; for as such it is app. used as 
sing, and pi., being originally an inf. n.:] but El- 
'Ajjaj has pluralized it, [regarding it in the 
sense expl. above,] saying, 443 34 UU3i jjSi 
44*= 44 154** u4j [They mentioned griefs to 
him who grieved, and they excited wonder to him 
who wondered]. (O.) 4 [maybe rendered O 

case of wonder! but properly] means O wonder 
come, for this is thy time: and 44 U [may also 
be rendered O case of wonder! but properly] 
means O [people, or the like, come] to wonder; 
the noun signifying the invoked being 
suppressed. (Har p. 27.) — It is also an epithet 
applied to a thing, an affair, an event, or a case; 
one says 4=* 4* [A wonderful thing or affair 
&c.]; and so J. 4 u>* [which is more common in 
this sense], and [ 44, and { 44c: or j 4 is 
syn. with 44; but J, 44- signifies more 
than 4=*: (K:) or J, 44° is syn. with J. 4;>* , (S, 
O,) which signifies a thing, (S, O, Msb,) or an 
affair, or event, or a case, (S, O,) wondered at; (S, 
O, Msb, TA;) or inducing wonder, or admiration, 
and pleasure, or joy; or pleasing, or rejoicing; 
syn. [ 44-S (TA;) and J, 44°; signifies 
more than 4?*: (S, O, TA:) [it is said that] 44 
has no ph; [app. meaning when it is used as an 
epithet, as observed above;] nor has J. 4;>* ; 
(S, O, K;) or the pi. of this is 44* [respecting 
which see 4?*]; (S, O, K;) like as 44 is pi. 
of and j-4, 0 f 4 =. (S, O.) [Being originally an 

inf. n., it is used alike as masc. and fern.:] one 
says 4?* 4aS [meaning A wonderful story: and 
for the same reason, it may, as an epithet, be also 

used alike as sing, and pi.: like 34 &c.]. (O.) 

[It is also used as a subst. in a pi. sense, 
signifying Wonders, as meaning wonderful 
things; like the pi. 44*, &c.; and it may 
be similarly used in a sing, sense for 44 >4 
or 4?* 4: but when used as a subst. in the pi. 
sense expl. above, it seems to be regarded by 
some as a coll. gen. n., of which [ 4* is the n. 
un.; for] one says, 44 4 4* V] 1*> [Such a 
one is none other than a wonder of wonders]. (A, 
TA.) [Hence, also,] 4»' l .4 [lit. The father of 
wonders] is a surname of Fortune. (TA.) And it 
signifies also The practiser of legerdemain, or 
sleight-of-hand; syn. 44*11, (A, TA,) 

or (Eth-Tha'alibee, TA in *4) and any 

one who does wonderful things. (A, TA.) And a 
poet says, 44 VI 4 4 c U [for 4* 44! 4 
O, I wonder greatly, lit. with wondering, at 
fortune that is ever attended with wonders]. 
(TA.) [See also 4?*.] — Also The quality, in a 


she-camel, that is denoted by the epithet =44 
[fern, of 4*!, q. v.]; and so [ 44. (O.) 44: see

beloved, or an object of love: so in the following 
verse, cited by Th: 4^ - j 4 V j 44 44 4 
4#4 3] 44= 44 [And neither does 

niggardliness forbid me nor liberality lead me; 
but she is a sort of person, to me, an object of 
love]: by 44 the poet means 444 (L, 
TA.) 4#?* (K) and 4 4j4' (S, O, K) A wonderful 
thing; a thing at which one wonders: (S, O, K: *) 
[the pi. of the former, accord, to modern usage, 
is 44*, mentioned above as pi. of 4=*: 
and] m4*I seems to be pi. of 44* i, like as 4-4 
is pi. of 44.1: (S, O:) and 4 v4=*= 

signifies wonderful things; syn. 44*; (S, O, K;) 
and is a word [of a rare form, (see 344,)] having 
no proper sing., (S, O,) like 4414; 

(O;) erroneously thought by the author of the “ 
Namoos ” [on the Kamoos] to be most probably a 
mistake for *4-4 (TA:) a poet says, *4*= jij 
m* 3* J 44-i 4“ 4^=4 4ll 31 k [And of the 

wonderful things of God's creation is a grape-vine 
covering the ground (so 444 is expl. by 
IB), whereof grapes of the kinds called 4^-° 
and s=*u* are pressed for making wine]. (S, 
O.) 44*: see 44*, near the middle of the 
paragraph, in two places. 44* 4=* [meaning 
Very wonderful or admirable or pleasing] (S, O, 
K) is like lSV 3)1, the latter word being a 
corroborative of the former; (S, O;) and one says 
also [in like manner] 4 44* 4?*. 

(K.) *4*' [More, and most, wonderful or 

admirable or pleasing]. [And the fem.] =4* 

signifies A female wondered at for her beauty: 
and also, for her ugliness. (O, K.) — Also, i. e. the 
former, A thick, or big, or coarse, camel. (O, K. *) 
And so the fem. applied to a she-camel: (O, 
K:) or, so applied, thick in the 4* [or root, &c.,] 
of the tail: (TA:) or whereof the hinder part, (O, 
K,) or the upper portion of that part, (L, TA,) is 
narrow, and whereof the 344 [q. v.] are 
prominent: (O, L, K, TA:) the kind of make thus 
particularized is ugly. (TA.) 44*': see 4=?*. 34 j 
44*2 A man of (lit. having, possessing, or 
endowed with,) wonders, or wonderful things. 
(O, K, TA.) v4=*=, a pi. without a 
sing.: see 4#?*. 44 444 and 4 4, [Admiring 
himself, Qit. excited to admiration by himself,) or 
pleased with himself, and his opinion, 
or judgment; selfconceited, and conceited of his 
opinion or judgment,] (S, O, TA,) [or] vain, or 
proud, [thereof; for] 44 = signifies a man vain, or 


proud, of what proceeds from him, whether good 
or bad, and of himself, or of a thing [belonging to 
him, such as his dress or wealth &c.]: but Er- 
Raghib makes a distinction between 444 
and 43; saying that the m*** believes himself 
with respect to the opinion or judgment that he 
forms of himself indecisively from evidence 
outweighed in probability; [so that it rather 
denotes conceit than vanity;] whereas the 412 
believes himself decisively. (MF, TA.) 4=4 
[Inducing wonder, or admiration, &c.]: see 4?*, 
in the middle of the paragraph: [or] a thing that 
is very good or goodly or beautiful. (TA.) j==*

equal]; and so j 3j3 : (K:) or, accord, to Er- 
Raghib, j 33 and 33 are nearly the same; but 
the former is used in relation to what is perceived 
mentally, as in the phrase of the Kur [v. 96], jl 
^l]j 33 [mentioned voce 33] ; and 33 and 
i 3j3, in relation to what is perceived by the 
sense, as things weighed and things numbered 
and things measured: Ibn-'Amir, however, read jl 
33; and Ks and the people of El-Medeeneh, 
with fet-h [i. e. 33]: (TA:) or 33, with kesr, 
signifies the like of the thing in kind, (Mgh, Msb,) 
or in quantity, or measure, or the like, (Msb,) 
or also in quantity, or measure, or the like, 
(Mgh,) and IF says, in weight; (Msb;) and j -d3 ; 
with fet-h, (Mgh, Msb,) its like, (Mgh,) or what 
will stand in its stead, (Msb,) of a thing different 
in kind, (Mgh, Msb;) whence the phrase of the 
Kur 3Lh 33 31 [mentioned above]; 3-^ being 
originally an inf. n.: (Msb:) Akh says, 3311, with 
kesr, signifies 3M; and J, 3311, with fet-h, is 
originally an inf. n., but is made a subst. to 
denote 3311 in order to distinguish it from 
the 33 of goods or commodities [which will be 
expl. in what follows]: Fr says, 3311, with kesr, is 
the like (3311), as in the saying dLili 33 ^dic 
[I have the like of thy boy or young man] and 3^ 
313 [the like of thy sheep or goat]; but you say 
l 3311, with nasb [i. e. fet-h] to the £, when you 
mean the [equal in] value, of what is different in 
kind; though sometimes it is pronounced with 
kesr by some of the Arabs, app. by an error on 
their part: (S, O:) or some allow one's saying ls^ 
dlfM fc 3 3 as meaning I have the like of thy boy or 
young man, [and app. [ “did also,] and -d3 with 
fet-h only as meaning his value: (TA:) but Zj says 
that 3311 and 3311 both signify the like, whether it 
be of the same kind or of a different kind; and if 
one make a mistake, he should not say that some 
of the Arabs have erred: (O:) the pi. (S, O, K) 
of 33, by common consent, (S, O,) is 3l3i, (S, O, 

K,) and [that of J. 3j^ is] JV3. (K.) Also 

The half of a load, (K, TA,) such as is on either of 
the two sides of the camel; (TA;) or a burden 
[borne on one side of a beast, counterbalancing 
another on the other side, or] made 
equiponderant to another burden: (Az, TA:) pi. 
[of pauc.] 3l3i and [of mult.] 3j3 : (Sb, K:) and 
J, 3j3 signifies the equal of a person in weight 
and measure or size or the like (S, K, * TA) in the 
[vehicle called] (TA:) Sb says that it 

signifies a human being that is the equal of 


another [in weight]; distinguishing it from 33, 
which, he says, is applied only to goods, or 
commodities: (IB, TA:) [but] j signifies 

two sacks (ijdjlje); because each counter 
balances, or is equiponderant to, the other. (TA.) 
Hence one says of the J j3 of an evil judicial 
decision, 3 j3 j 3 j3 ii [meaning They are 

not witnesses whose testimony is approvable, but 
equalized loads of merchandise]. (TA.) And 
[hence also] one says, ^13 g3

neither of them having thrown down the other.

of a witness such as is termed 33 [q. v.]: it 
is expl. as being a quality the regard of which 
necessitates the guarding against what falls short 
of the requirements of manly virtue or 
moral goodness, habitually and evidently; which 
evident falling short thereof is not effected by 
small instances of lapses or falls into 
wrongdoing, and by perversion of speech, 
because mistake and forgetfulness 
are supposable [as the causes thereof], and 
interpretation not according to the obvious 
meaning; but it is when such is the known and 
repeated practice of the person: regard is to be 
had to the goodness, or honesty, of every 
individual, and his usual practice in respect of his 
apparel, and his dealing in selling and buying, 
and the conveyance of goods, and other things; 
and when he does that which is not suitable to 
him, without necessity, his testimony is 
impugned; otherwise it is not. (Msb.) 31j3 :

last quarter, cylj^ An old, tall tree: (K:) or l 33“ 
3lj3 signifies old trees; one of which is

preceding paragraph, in two places. — Also, thus 
correctly, as in the S, (TA, [and thus, app.,

meaning, as would be imagined from the context 
in the K, the tree [said to be] thus called; (TA;) 
mentioned in the poetry of Tarafeh, (S, O, TA,) in 
the fourth verse of his Mo'allakah, (O, TA,) and

back, from a thing: (K, TA:) or iijie- signifies a

meaning land that is not even, or plain; not easy 
to walk or ride or lie upon: or, as some say, it 
means a rough, rugged, place: or an elevated 
place upon which the camel lies down and then 
reclines thereon upon his side, having by his side 
a depressed place, which causes him to

termed from 22 “ he prevented ” &c.; because it 
prevents the person punished from returning to 
the like of his offence, and prevents others from 
doing the like of that which he has done: (MF, 
TA:) [it generally signifies any corporal 
punishment:] and, by an extension of the original 
signification, any [infliction of] pain that 
disgraces, or puts to shame: (Ksh and Bd ubi 
supra:) originally, beating: afterwards used to 
signify any painful punishment: [torture; or 
torment:] and metaphorically applied to 
(tropical:) an affair, or event, that is difficult, 
distressing, afflicting, or troublesome; whence 
the saying, 2211 223 j2*ll [Travel is a portion 

of that which is difficult, &c.; or of torment]:

famine: (Zj, O, TA:) the pi. is 4Aei ; (Zj, K, TA:)

it has no pi.: [and it seems to be doubted whether 
it have a pi. because it is properly an inf. n. 
though its verb in the unaugmented form is not 
used:] but MF observes that if it be a name for 
that whereby one is prevented [from repeating an 
offence], as hunger, or famine, agreeably with 
what Zj says, there is no reason why it should not 
have this pi. (TA.) gee 442, in seven

or abstaining, or that abstains, from eating, by 
reason of intense thirst; (K, TA;) applied to a 
man, and an ass, and a horse: but Az says that 


the assertion respecting these two epithets that 
they signify [a horse, &c.] that neither eats nor 
drinks is more correct than the 
assertion respecting J, m that it signifies [one] 
that abstains from eating by reason of his thirst: 
also, that 442 signifies any animal, but generally 
a horse and a camel, that will not eat anything: 
accord, to Th, this and J. m signify a horse or 
the like standing still, or stopping from fatigue, 
(fjla,) that raises his head, and will not eat nor 
drink; and the former, that passes a night 
without eating anything: (TA:) the pi. of 442

mistake, for a word of the measure 3 j*s does not 
form a pi. of the measure 3 j*s; but [SM says] this 
is an extr. instance; and he who preserves an 
authority in his mind is an evidence against him 
who does not. (TA.) One says, J, lij^t 2U

drinking anything; because abstaining therefrom.

exculpated, him for what he did. (Msb.) And in a

Verily God hath excused thee, and exempted thee

he should be excused. (TA.) [See also 8.] He 

did that by which he should be excused. (TA.) —

be excused. (S, O: but in the latter, fSiliij.) 

And He exceeded the usual bounds, (A, Mgh, O,)

saying jUI jic .1 [He exceeds the usual bounds

since He hath granted him respite for all this 
length of time and he hath not excused himself. 
(TA. [As jiel is here followed by J!, I do not 
think that this explanation is meant to show that 
the I has a privative effect, and that the verb 
signifies “ he deprived of excuse. ”]) — — 
[Hence,] He exerted himself, acted vigorously, 
took extraordinary pains, or exceeded the usual 
bounds, [so as to render himself excused,] (S, O, 
Msb, K, TA,) jAl (ji in the affair; (S, O, Msb;) as,

the custom of the Prophet; for, when he ate with 


others, he was the last in eating. (TA.) [Hence

one prepares, and to which he invites his 
brethren, on the occasion of the acquisition of 
something new: (O, K:) and accord, to the K, all 
the other words mentioned above also have, app., 
the former, or perhaps the latter, of these two 
meanings, as well as the meaning first 
mentioned above, which is the most common. 
(TA.) j 2 * 2 ; pi. see '“jp, 

second sentence, j 2 * 2 : see j^** 2 , in two 
places. “j 2 * 2 and » j 2 * 2 and » j 2 * 2 ; and the pi. j 2 * 2 : 
see j 2 ^, in five places: and for the first, see also 
8. j 2 * 2 [properly signifying The place of the J-P 
or of the gljlic-]: see in four places. j 2 * 2 
and j 2 ? 2 and j 2 * 2 : see j 22 * 2 , in six places. jl 2 *-? 
sing, of jjil", (O, K,) which signifies [Excuses, or 
apologies;] pleas, allegations, or arguments: (K, 

TA: see jit, in two places:) and also, (K, 

TA,) in the dial, of El-Yemen, (TA,) Veils, 
curtains, or coverings. (O, K, TA.) The saying in 
the Kur [lxxv. 14 and 15], ^ jlLjVI Jj 

IjjiUi ^311 313 i s expl. as meaning [Nay, the 
man shall be witness against himself, though he 
throw] his veils or coverings [over his offences]: 
(TA:) or (accord, to Muja- hid, S, O), [though he 
offer his excuses; or] though he dispute 
respecting it (S, O, TA) with every plea by which 
he may excuse himself. (TA.) jj 2 *-* 

Excused; freed, cleared, or exempted, from 
blame; exculpated. (Msb.) — — And [hence, 
perhaps,] sjjii^ applied to a woman 

signifies [q. v . in art. j-^]: and 

sometimes one says 4 »j)lt ; as meaning having 
an excuse: (Msb:) the latter is said to be used in 
the sense of but it requires 

consideration; (O, TA;) as though it were of the 
measure <^3 in the sense of ^ [i. e. in the 

sense of sjj^ii as meaning excused,] from 
jiill. (TA.) — — [Golius assigns to jj 2 * 2 
the meaning of “ Voti impos; ” as on the authority 
of the KL; in which, however, I do not find it.] — 
Also (tropical:) Circumcised. (S, A, O, Msb.) — 
And A camel branded with the mark called 
(TA.) — And [A child] affected with the pain, of 
the fauces, termed » j^. (S, O, K.) j 2 * 2 : see its pi. 
in the last clause of the following paragraph. j 2 * 2 
One excusing himself, whether he have, or have 
not, an excuse: (TA:) the person to whom this 
epithet is applied may be a speaker of truth, and 
he may be not a speaker of truth: (Msb, TA:) and 
so 4 j 2 * 2 , which, as applied to a speaker of truth, 
signifies having an excuse, like j 2 * 2 , (S, O, K,) [of 
which it is a variation,] for the cj is changed 
into 2 , and this is incorporated [into the 
radical 2 ], and its vowel is transferred to the £, 
like as is the case in jj > 2 (S, O;) and 4 j 22 is 
also allowable, (S, O, TA,) and also 4 j 2 * 2 ; (S, O;) 
but [it is said that] J, j 2 * 2 applied to him who 


does not speak truth, (S, O, K,) being [originally] 
of the measure l)* 22 , [not a variation of j 2 * 2 ,] (S, 
O,) means falling short, or doing less than is 
incumbent on him, (S, O, K,) excusing himself (S, 
O) without having any [real or valid] excuse. (S, 
O, K.) In the Kur ix. 91, TAb read J. ujj 2 * 2 !! 
[instead of the more usual reading J, Oljj 2 * 2 ^], (S, 
O, K,) and so did Yaakoob El-Hadramee, (Az, 
TA,) from j 22 ; the former asserting that it was 
so revealed; app. considering [ j- 2 *-*, with 
teshdeed, to apply to one not speaking truth, (S, 
O, K,) meaning pretending to excuse himself, 
without having any real excuse; (S, O;) and J, j- 2 *-* 
to mean having an excuse: (S, O, K:) Ibn-Abee- 
Leyla and Ta-oos read J, Ojj 222 ^, as meaning 
those striving, or labouring, in seeking excuse.

Alvum ejecit, ventumve per anum emisit, in

congressum: (K:) or semen in co'itu non emisit: 
(TA:) and 4 aor. , inf. n. -laic., signifies the 
same: (Msb:) or there is no verb derived 
from because it denotes a natural quality: 

(O, K:) so says El-Mufaddal Ibn-Selemeh, in his 
book on the errors in the 'Eyn: but the rule is only 
one which applies in most instances, of which 
this is not one; for the former of these words is of 
established authority, mentioned by Ibn-Malik 
and others of the leading lexicologists. (TA.)

the latter word is used as a corroborative of the

O, Msb, K) and J, 44' m 4' (O) and [ m 4' 
44' (K) and [ “44' 4 4' (CK [but this I do not 
find in any other copy of the K]) are appellations 
of The pure, or genuine Arabs: (S, A, O, K:) 
or those who spoke the language of Yaarub Ibn- 
Kahtan; which is the ancient language: (Msb:) 
and l 444*11 44', (S, O, Msb, K,) as also 
J, 44“" m 4', (S, O, K,) is an appellation of The 
insititious [or naturalized Arabs]; (K;) those who 
are not pure, or genuine, Arabs: (S, O:) or those 
who spoke the language of Isma'eel [or Ishmael] 
the son of Ibraheem [or Abraham], i. e., the 
dialects of El-Hijaz and the parts adjacent 
thereto: (Msb:) and the appellation of J, 44““ is 
thought by Az to apply [also] to people not of 
pure Arabian descent, who have introduced 
themselves among the Arabs, and speak their 
language, and imitate their manner or 
appearance. (TA.) [The former division is 
most reasonably considered as consisting of the 
extinct tribes ('Ad, Thamood, and others 
mentioned in what follows); or of these together 
with the unmixed descendants of Kahtan, whose 
claims to the appellation of genuine Arabs are 
held by many to be equally valid: and the 
latter division, as consisting of those whose 
origin is referred, through Ma'add and 'Adnan, to 
Isma'eel (or Ishmael), whose wife was 
descended from Kahtan. What I find in the TA, 
on this subject, is as follows.] The former of these 
two divisions consisted of nine tribes, 
descendants of Irem [or Aram] the son of Sam 
[or Shem] the son of Nooh [or Noah]; namely, 
Ad, Thamood, Umeiyim, 'Abeel, Tasm, Jedees, 
'Imleek [or Amalek], Jurhum, and Webari; and 
from them Isma'eel [or Ishmael is said to have] 
learned the Arabic language: and the J, 414“ are 
[said to be] the descendants of Isma'eel, the 
descendants of Ma'add the son of 'Adnan the son 
of Udd: so says Abu-l-Khattab Ibn-Dihyeh, 
surnamed Dhun-Nesebeyn: or the former 

division consisted of seven tribes, namely, 
Ad, Thamood, 'Imleek, Tasm, Jedees, Umeiyim, 
and Jasim; the main portion of whom has 
become extinct, some remains of them, only, 
being scattered among the [existing] tribes: so 
says IDrd: and the appellation of J, 4_4' 44' is 
also given to the descendants of Yaarub the son 
of Kahtan [only]. (TA.) [It should be observed, 
however, that the appellation of l 44*" is, by 
those who hold the extinct tribes 
above mentioned as the only genuine Arabs, 
applied to the unmixed descendants of Kahtan; 


and l 4 4'“" , to those who are held to be the 
descendants of Isma'eel: thus in the Mz, 1 st £ 4. 
Also, it should be observed that the appellation of 
J, 44" 44', in the conventional language 
of Arabic lexicology, is often applied to the Arabs 
of the classical ages, and the later Arabs of the 
desert who retained the pure language of their 
ancestors, indiscriminately: it is thus applied by 
writers quoted in the Mz (ist £ 4) to all the 
descendants of Kahtan, and those of Ma'add the 
son of 'Adnan (through whom all the descendants 
of Isma'eel trace their ancestry) who lived before 
the corruption, among them, of the Arabic 

language.] J, 4 ' 4 Yl is the appellation given 

to Those [Arabs] who dwell in the desert; (S, 
Mgh, O, Msb, K;) such as go about in search of 
herbage and water; and Az adds, whether of the 
Arabs or of their freedmen: he says that it is 
applied to those who alight and abide in the 
desert, and are neighbours of the dwellers in the 
desert, and journey, or migrate, with them, to 
seek after herbage and water: (Msb:) it is not a pi. 
of 44', not being like - 4 YI, which is pi. 
of -441; (s, O;) but is a [coll.] gen. n.: (S:) 4)4'-" 
occurs as its pi. (S, O, K) in chaste poetry: (S:) it 
has no sing, [properly so termed]: (K:) the rel. n. 
is i 4-4, (S, O,) which is applied to single 
person; (Msb;) as also is 4: (TA:) Az says, if one 
say to an A A- 1 ) ,4)1(4', he is pleased; and if one 

say to an 4)1(4' l) ,4)(4, he is angry. (TA.) 

Authors differ as to the cause why the m( 4 were 
thus called: some say, because of the perspicuity 
of their speech, from 414': others, that they 
were so called from Yaarub the son of Kahtan, 
who is said to have been the first that spoke the 
Arabic language; his original language having 
been, as asserted by IDrd, [what the Arabs term] 
Syriac; though some say that Isma'eel was the 
first that spoke the Arabic language; and some, 
that Yaarub was the first that spoke Arabic, and 
that Isma'eel was the first that spoke the pure 
Arabic of El-Hijaz, in which the Kur-an was 
revealed: others say that the m( 4 were so called 
from 44', the name of a tract near El- 
Medeeneh, or a name of Mekkeh and the 
adjacent region, where Isma'eel settled, or the 
same as Tihameh [as is said in the Mgh, in which 
this is pronounced to be the most correct 
derivation], or the general name of the peninsula 
of Arabia, which is also called 4 j*ll [as is said in 
the Msb]: but some say that they were so 
called in like manner as were the and the f j j 

and the 44 and others, not after the name of a 
land or other than a land, but by the coining of 
the name, not a term expressive of a quality or a 
state or condition &c. (TA.) [If the country were 
called 414', an inhabitant thereof might 


be called, agreeably with analogy, 4)(4; and then, 
the people collectively, 4(4': but I think that the 
most probable derivation is from the old Hebrew 
word inj,', meaning “ a mixed people,” which the 
Arabs assert themselves to have been, almost 
from the first; and in favour of this derivation it 
may be reasonably urged that the old Himyeritic 
language agrees more in its vocabulary with the 
Hebrew and Phoenician than it does with the 
classical and modern Arabic.] — See also 414. —

means A thing that one gives, or yields, for

(TA.) A poet says, namely El-Harith Ibn-

belonging to Malik Ibn-Zuheyr, which Hamal

him, and which El-Harith took from Hamal when 


he slew him, (TA,) -rtikti U 3 gjill jlii

Su 511 3> 3^ 3? (which is a prov., TA) means [I 
experienced from such a one] hardship, as expl. 
by As, who says that he knew not the origin 
thereof, (S, O,) or difficulty, or distress, as expl. 
by IDrd: (O:) and it is said that the 3 j^ [or 
sweat] is of the man, not of the 33 [or water- 
skin]; and the origin of the saying is, that water- 
skins (m3?) are [generally] carried only by female 
slaves that bear burdens, and by him who has no 
assistant; but sometimes a man of generous 
origin becomes poor, and in need of carrying 
them himself, and he sweats by reason of the 
trouble that comes upon him, and of shame; (S, 
O;) wherefore one says, 4)3P 33^ ^ [expl. 

in art. ^m], (S,) or <)3^ 33^ [likewise 

expl. in art. ^m]: accord, to Ks, the meaning is, I 
have suffered fatigue, and imposed upon 
myself difficulty, for thee, [or in coming to thee,] 
so that I have sweated like the sweating of the 
water-skin: or, accord, to A'Obeyd, I 

have imposed upon myself, in coming to thee, 
what no one has attained, and what will not be; 
because the does not sweat: ( 0 :) 33- is 

a metonymical expression for hardship, and 
difficulty, or distress; because, when the 
sweats, its odour becomes foul: or because it 
has no sweat; therefore it is as though one 
imposed upon himself an impossible thing: or it 
means the benefit of the 33\ (which is 
the flowing of its water, TA;) as though one 
imposed upon himself such a task that he became 
in need of the water of the 33, i. e. of journeying 
to it; or it means a [or plaited suspensory] 
which the carrier of the 33 puts over his chest 
[when carrying the 33 on his back]: (K:) accord, 
to IAar, it signifies the suspensory (3^*-“) by 
means of which the is carried; as also ' m^; 
(O, TA;) the j being substituted for J: (TA: see 
art. j:]) but he says also that 33 means 
one's sweating with the by reason of the 
difficulty, or trouble, of carrying it; and that 
by which it is tied, or bound, and then 
suspended: (L, TA:) the former is also said to 
signify the J, 3'3>? [q. v.] of the that is sewed 
around it: (TA:) or it means that one has imposed 
upon himself difficulty, or trouble, or fatigue, like 
that of the carrier of the who sweats beneath 
it by reason of its heaviness. (K.) 33 also

to Zj, is a mistake of Abu-l-'Abbas [i. e. Th], 
and m jc. is used as an epithet of a man and of a 
woman, like as is and does not assume 

a dual form nor a pi. nor a fern, form, because it 
is originally an inf. n.; MF, however, denies that 
we have any authority for calling an inf. n.: 
he considers it to be a simple epithet, like 
&c.; and if used in the fem. sense without the 
termination » otherwise than by poetic license, to 
be an anomalous epithet, like which is 

applied alike to a man and to a woman: the 
phrase u44^ is also mentioned: and the 

saying 4-0^ 4-> >1 ^->J [in which the latter epithet is 
merely an imitative sequent corrobative of the

Remote in the pasturage, (O, TA,) that do not 
return in the evening, (O,) or that do not repair to 
the place of alighting and abode [of their owners]

as also J. m 1 4*-?: (A, O, K:) accord, to Az, 
the former is the only epithet of the 
measure except which is sometimes 

used; [but in the TA, and and 

also are mentioned;] the » in 4", he says, is 
added to give intensiveness to the signification, 


and to imply praise; the meaning being, in 
his opinion, a man who frequently betakes 
himself, with his cattle, or camels &c., pasturing 
at a distance from others, to the places 
where rain has fallen, and to the uncropped 
herbage produced thereby; and he adds that the » 
is affixed to a masc. epithet to imply praise or 
blame when intensiveness is meant. (TA.) The 
two epithets above are also expl. as applied to a 
man who pastures his camels at a distance from 
the abode of the tribe, not repairing to them to 

rest. (TA.) [See also m jc &c.] Also, (S, O, K,

£ 44 [meaning, accord, to what has been said 
above, Zeyd is near to going forth, though 
generally otherwise expl., as will he shown in 
what follows], and j u' lit [Such 

a woman is near to going forth]; 4 j being the 
agent of ur-*-, and j; 44 u' being its objective 
complement and meaning £jj4ll ; and one says 
also, 4*4 u' ‘■ '•(u . c [as meaning, accord, to 
what here precedes, I am near to doing that], 
and c'iu j c , with kesr, agreeably with readings [in 
the Kur xlvii. 24], 4- r - 3ja and 4> r -, with kesr 
and fet-h; and one says to a woman, J*1 j J cA -a e 
^'4 and [to women,] 04“*°; but one does not 
use the form J*4 thereof, nor the form l)?U; (S;) 
both of which [however] are memtioned [as 
used] by the author of the “ Insaf: ” (I 'Ak p. 
88:) [or, accord, to Fei,] is a preterite verb, 
[used in the sense of the present,] aplastic, not 
perfectly inflected, of the verbs 
of appropinquation, implying hope, and eager 
desire, and sometimes opinion, and certainty; 
and it is incomplete [i. e. non-attributive], 
and complete [i. e. attributive]: the incomplete 
has for its predicate an aor. mansoob by means 
of ul as in the saying, 4 j 4 u' 4j 
meaning 4P 4j 40^ [Zeyd is near to standing], 
the predicate being an objective complement or 
having the meaning of an objective 
complement: or, as some say, the meaning is 5*1 
4>4 o' '4j, i. e. [virtually, but not literally,] I 
eagerly desire, or I hope, that Zeyd may be 
performing the act of standing: [but see 
and 4*1 in art. J^, as well as what follows in this 
paragraph after the explanation of the next ex.:] 
the complete is such as occurs in the saying, 

4 j f u' [meaning, accord, to what is said above, 

Zeyd's standing is near to being a fact]; the agent 
being literally a phrase composed of a subject and 
an attribute because O' is here what is 
termed [so that 4j fj4 O' is equivalent 

to 4 j f4l]: (Msb:) [in the MA and PS and 

TK & c., is expl. as meaning It may be that; 

and this, or simply may-be, or may-hap, or 
perhaps, I regard as the preferable rendering; as 
being virtually the meaning in all cases: for 
4*4 o' 4j, in which it is used as an incomplete 
verb, however it may be rendered, virtually 
means It may be that Zeyd is, or will be, standing; 
or may-be Zeyd &c.: and 4j o' ur— “S in which 
it is used as a complete verb, virtually means the 
same, though more properly rendered Zeyd's 
standing may be a fact: its usages are various, 
and have occasioned much dispute respecting 
its grammatical character and its meaning or 
meanings; as will be shown by what here 
follows:] — — it is [said to be] a verb 
unrestrictedly, or a particle unrestrictedly: (K:) 


[but this statement seems to have originated 
from a mistranscription: IHsh says,] it is a 
verb unrestrictedly: not a particle unrestrictedly, 
contrary to the opinion of Ibn-Ks-Sarraj and Th; 
nor when it has an affixed pronoun, as 
in contrary to an opinion of Sb, ascribed to 
him by Seer: (Mughnee:) it denotes hope in the 
case of that which is liked, and fear in the case 
of that which is disliked; as in the saying in the 
Kur [ii. 213], 4* 4 j 144 I o' ls-^j 

4^ 4“ >3 lili [But it may be that ye 

dislike a thing when it is good for you, and it may 
be that ye like a thing when it is evil for you]: 

(Mughnee, K: *) it is used in various ways; 

one of which is the saying, u' 4j 4“° 
[mentioned above], respecting the analysis of 
which there are different opinions: that of the 
generality is, that it is like f j4 4 j 0*4 [inasmuch 
as is here an incomplete verb]; but this is 
deemed dubious, because the predicate [f j4 o'] is 
rendered by an inf. n., and the subject [4j] is a 
substance; to which several replies have 
been made; one being that a prefixed noun is 
meant to be understood, either before the 
subject, so that the meaning is, 4 j -4' 

[It may be that the case of Zeyd is, or will be, the 
performing of the act of standing], or before the 
predicate, so that the meaning is 4j 
e44' [It may be that Zeyd is, or will be, the 

performer of the act of standing]; and another 
reply is, that it is of the class of 0^ 4 j and f 4 s3 
[meaning 44c and 4'-“ 3 , for f j4 u' is equivalent to 
an inf. n., and an inf. n. may be used in the sense 
of an act. part, n.]; and another is, that u' is here 
redundant, which reply is [said to be] 
nought, because o' has rendered the aormansoob, 
and because it seldom falls out [from the phrase, 
though it should be remarked that 0*1, which is 
said in the Mughnee to be like in meaning, is 
generally followed by a simple aor. and 
sometimes by u' and an aor.]: another opinion 
respecting the analysis of the phrase is, that 
is a trans. verb, like in meaning and in 
government, [agreeably with the explanations 
mentioned above from the S and Msb,] or 
intrans. like 4> with the 

preposition suppressed; and this is the opinion of 
Sb and Mbr: the opinion of the generality is, that 
it is an incomplete verb [like in the 
phrase f j4 4 j 04 mentioned above], and that o' 
and the verb following it compose a substitute of 
implication supplying what is wanting in the 

two preceding portions of the sentence: the 

second way of using it is, the making it to have o' 
and the verb following this for its object, [as 
in 4 j f j4 u' ls^°, mentioned above], so that it is a 
complete verb: — — the third and fourth and 


fifth are when it is followed by a simple aor. 
[being in this case likened to 1>4 (S, K, * TA.)] or 
an aor. with prefixed, or a single noun; as 
in 44 4 j ls-^ [It may be that Zeyd stands, or will 
stand] and f 44 4 j cr** 0 [It may be that Zeyd will 
stand] and 4^ 4 j [It may be that Zeyd is 

standing]; the first whereof is one of which there 
are few exs., such as the saying, i_s4' vjSlI ,4^ 
MJ4 ii 4 “*'jj o44 4 [it may be that the 
state of anxiety in which thou hast become (or, as 
some relate it, ‘- ' ■‘ > “■4 i. e. I hare become,) is such 
that after it will be a near removal thereof]; and 
the third is one of which there are fewer exs., 
[and which is said in the S to be not allowable,] 
such as the saying, Oj-^I V Uib Uii JiaJI 4 CijiSi 
U:U^> riu . c 41 [or, as some relate it, ‘- 'n .a e , which 
is more common, i. e. Thou hast been profuse in 
censuring, persisting constantly: be not thou 
profuse: verily it may be that I am, or shall be, 
abstaining]; and as to the prov., 4jji j4>*1' 

[expl. in art. and of which it is said in the K 
that the verb therein is used in the manner of 0 14, 
and in the S that the phrase is extr., that '-“*j4 
is there put in the place of the predicate, and that 
there sometimes occurs in provs. what does not 
occur elsewhere], the right opinion is that 044 is 
suppressed before V)4; and [in the latter of the 
two verses cited above] 04“' is suppressed 
before because thus the primary usage is 

preserved, and because what is hoped is the 
person's being an abstainer, not the abstainer 
him- self; and as to the second of the three modes 
of using 4“^ last mentioned above, with o* 

prefixed to the aor., it is very extr.: the sixth 

way of using it is the saying 4-“^ and 
and which is rare: in this case, accord, to Sb, 
it is used in the manner of 4*1, as governing the 
subject in the accus. case, and the predicate in 
the nom.; the predicate being 
sometimes expressed, in the nom. case, as in the 
saying, 1*4^ 4'-! w . f 1 ^ 1 c.j jl) Uhlluc. cliha 

Ujjcli [And I said, May-be it is the fire of Ka-s, 
(for I suppose that is here a proper name, 
that of a woman, daughter of El-Kelhabeh El- 
’Oranee,) and perhaps she has a complaint, (t^iu 
being for ^444,) so I will come towards her, and 
visit her]: — — the seventh way is the 

saying, 4^ 4j ls^, mentioned by Th; which is to 
be explained on the ground that Lr “* c is here an 
incomplete verb, and that its subject is the 
ijU*ll [[. e j s suppressed, the meaning being, It 
may be that the case is this, Zeyd is standing], the 
nominal proposition being the predicate. 
(Mughnee. [Several other statements in that 
work, respecting I have omitted, as being 
refuted therein, or as being of little or no 
importance.]) — — It also denotes

pronounce the 1 > with fet-h; and you make the

fet-h for the termination: (TA:) you say, >5h

and >5h [Thirteen], and so on; (Msb, TA;) 
with fet-h to the y5; and in one dial, with sukoon 
[>5h ii.l ( &c.]; (Msb;) or the former only: (S, 
O:) and, as ISk says, some of the Arabs make 
the £ quiescent, [as many do in the present day,] 
saying >5h and so on to y*- 

[inclusively] except in the instance of >5c. 155] 
and > Sc. (^j], because of the quiescence of the I 
and ls; and Akh says that they make the £ 


quiescent because the noun is long and its vowels 
are many: (S, O) in the fem., you add » to the 
latter of the two nouns, and reject the » in the 
former of them, and make the y5 in » > 5e 
quiescent: you say iyc. y:Aj (TA,) [and ISS]

you choose, you say »>5h [&c.,] with kesr to 

the y: the former is of the dial, of the people of 
El-Hijaz, [and is the more common,] and the 
latter is of the dial, of the people of Nejd: (S, O, 
TA:) but fet-h to the y5 in this case is unknown to 
the grammarians and lexicologists, as Az says, 
though an instance has been adduced in an 
unusual reading of the Kur ii. 57 , and another in 
vii. 160 . (TA.) Every noun of number, from 
eleven to nineteen [inclusively], is mansoob, [or 
more properly speaking, each of the two nouns of 
which it is composed is indecl., with fet-h,] in 
the cases of refa and nasb and khafd, except that 
of twelve; for kil and dil are decl. [i. e. you say, in 
a case of nasb or khafd, y*- and »>5h (s^'h

brings forth, and also after she has brought forth,

completion of a year: or when she has brought 
forth she is termed (TA:) or that has been 
eight months pregnant: or, applied to a she- 
camel, i. q. applied to a woman: (K:) it is 
applied also to any female that is pregnant, but 
mostly to the female of the horse and camel: 
(IAth:) it is the only sing, word of this measure, 
which is a pi. measure, except (MF:) the 
dual is gljljue-: (S, O, TA; in one copy of the 
S (jljl yc-:) and pi. -5ljl>ik; (S, O, K, TA; in one 
copy of the S, and in the CK *5 jI j' y &;) but some 
disallow this; (MF;) and jC5e; (S, O, Msb, K;) like 
as ykii is pi. of ei-Lii; (Msb;) and jk5e : (K in 
art. ykj:) or yk5c. is applied to she-camels until 
some of them have brought forth and others are 
expected to bring forth. (K.) Some say that jk5e 
have no milk; though El-Farezdak applies this 
term to camels that are milked, because of their 
having recently brought forth; and it is said 
that camels are most precious to their owners 
when they are J-5c. (TA.) >C5h ; as pi. of 3^e, 
which is pi. of y&, signifies Gazelles that have 
recently brought forth. (O.) Is y*- y Milk of

a specificative]: (TA:) it is deck with j and s [like 
a pi. formed by the addition of j and y]; (Msb;) 
and when you prefix it to another noun, making 
it to govern the latter in the gen. case, you drop 
the y, (S, Msb,) and say, k> j j ye [The twenty of 
Zeyd], (Msb,) and ye [Thy twenty], (S, O, 
Msb,) and Is ye [My twenty], changing the j 
into s [in this last case], because of the letter 
following it, and these incorporating: (S, O:) so 
says Ks; but most disallow this mode of prefixing 
in the case of a decimal number [of this kind], 
(Msb.) [It signifies also Twentieth.] It is not a pi. 
of i ye., (so in a copy of the S and in the O and in 
the TA.) or y&, (so in another copy of the S,) [or 
perhaps the right reading is ye, as may be 
inferred from what will be presently added: but 
first it should be observed that if it were 
pi. of iyc, or of y&, it would signify at least 
three times ten: some hold it to be a pi. of ye, 
saying, (TA.) as ye signifies camels' coming 
to water on the ninth day, they do not say d ye 
[for twenty], but they say yj ye, (in the K, Je p 
dye dye: but the correct reading seems 
to be tjljij p: TA: [in the CK it is more 
incorrect, dye 1 j yye Jh jJ:]) making 
eighteen days to be d'ye, and the nineteenth

[regarding the portion as a whole,] forming the 
ph yj ye; (K, * TA;) agreeably with a well- 
known license, which allows the calling two and a 
part of the third a pi: (TA:) this is the opinion of 
Kh and IDrd and some others: but J and most of 
the lexicologists hold that yj y& is not a ph 
of iyi. nor of ye nor of any other word, and 
their opinion I hold to be correct, applying as it 
does to the other similar nouns of number.

A certain plant, (S, K,) of the [kind of plants 
called] the grain of which is good for the 

piles, and for generating milk, and blackens 
the hair, (K,) or the leaves whereof, which are like 
those of the intensely green, blacken the 
hair when it is dressed therewith, and cause it to 
grow: (TA:) n. un. with °: (K:) Aboo-Ziyad says, it 
is of the [kind of plants called] and is a tree 
[or plant] that spreads upon the ground, having 
thick [in the TA wide] leaves, and not 
having thorns, and is scarcely, or never, eaten by 
anything but the goats, which take some little 
thereof, except its grain, for this is eaten: some of 
the Arabs call it 14; and when a grain thereof falls 
upon the ground and dries, it becomes red as 
though it were a bit of red wool: sometimes, he 
says, the women use its leaves in combing and 
dressing their hair, which it blackens, and causes 
to grow: he says also, an Arab of the desert, of 
Rabee'ah, informed me that the 33 j-ic rises upon 
a short stem, then spreads into many branches, 
and bears numerous fruits, which are long, broad 
pods, in every one of which pods are two rows 
of grains exactly like the stones of raisins, and 
these are eaten while fresh, and are cooked, and 
are pleasant in taste; and when the wind blows, 
those pods become in a state of commotion, 
being suspended by slender stalks, so that they 
make a rustling sound, and you hear, in the valley 
in which they are found, a low and confused 
sound, which frightens the camels; and the 
serpents do not make their abode in that valley, 
fleeing from the sound: its leaves are like those of 
the intensely green; and its grain is white, 
pleasant to the taste, easily broken, unctuous, 
and hot; good for the piles: Aboo-Ziyad also says 
that the and [i. e. senna] are like each 
other, except that the leaves of the latter are thin; 
also, that an Arab of the desert, of the Benoo- 
Asad, told him that the blossom of the i3j 4? 
inclines to whiteness; and that the places of its 
growth were said by some to be the rugged tracts: 
(O:) Az says that it is a herb of which the leaves 
and produce are like those of the j4 [or bay], 
except in being larger: IAar, that it is a red plant, 
of sweet odour, used by the brides: and IB, from 
As, that it is a cubit in height, having small 
grains, and, when dry, producing a sound by 
reason of the passage of the wind: (TA:)

of the pairs of water-bags, and with which 
they are tied when they are bound upon the back 
of the camel; after which the [rope called] j is 
bound over them: they are erroneously said by 
Lth to be the 3^3= [app. meaning borders] of the 
extremity of the 3 [or leathern water-bag], at 
the place of the ^ [or kidney-shaped piece 
of leather to which a loop is sewed]. (TA. [See

(S, O, K;) and it was the arrow of self-excuse: 
they used to do thus in the Time of Ignorance [on 
the occasion of a demand for blood-revenge]; and 
if the arrow returned smeared with blood, they 
were not content save with the retaliation of 
slaughter; but if it returned clean, they stroked 
their beards, and made reconciliation on the 
condition of the bloodwit; the stroking of the 
beards being a sign of reconciliation: the 
arrow, however, as IAar says, did not [ever] 
return otherwise than clean: (S, O:) the origin 
was this: a man of the tribe was slain, and the 
slayer was prosecuted for his blood; whereupon a 
company of the chief men [of the family of the 
slayer] collected themselves together to the 
heirs [who claimed satisfaction for the blood] of 
the slain, and offered the bloodwit, asking 
forgiveness for the blood; and if the heir [who 
claimed satisfaction and who acted for himself 
and his coheirs] was a strong man, impatient of 
injury, he refused to take the bloodwit; but if 


weak, he consulted the people of his tribe, and 
then said to the petitioners, “We have, between 
us and our Creator, a sign denoting command 
and prohibition: we take an arrow, and set it on a 
bow, and shoot it towards the sky; and if it return 
to us smeared with blood, we are forbidden 
to take the bloodwit, and are not content save 
with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it return 
clean, as it went up, we are commanded to take 
the bloodwit: ” so they made reconciliation; for 
this arrow never returned otherwise than clean; 
and thus they had an excuse in the opinion of the 
ignorant of them. (L, TA.) A poet (S, O, TA) of 
the family of the slain, said by some to be of

(Az, TA,) »ja^, aor. and inf. n. as above, He 
stabbed him, namely, a camel; slaughtered him 
by stabbing: (Az, Msb, TA:) because the 
slaughterer of the camel first lays bare its m ja Ip 
[or hocktendon; or hocks it; or strikes or cuts its 
legs, or one of its legs, with a sword: see above]. 
(Az, TA.) So in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, 

csjliiil Cijac [And the day when I 
slaughtered for the virgins my riding-camel]. 
(TA.) And so in the trad, J jac V [There 

shall be no slaughtering of camels at the grave in 
the time of El-Islam]: for they used to slaughter 
camels at the graves of the dead, saying, The 
occupant of the grave used to slaughter camels 
for guests in the days of his life; so we 
recompense him by doing the like after his death. 
(IAth, TA.) — — Hence also, He slew him; 
he destroyed him: of this signification we have an 
ex. in the story of Umm-Zara: j 1 -?- j And [a 

cause of] the destruction of her fellow- 
wife through [the latter’s] envy [of her] and rage 

[against her]. (TA.) ls'j& 4 (Mgh, O, 

Msb, K, &c.,) said of a woman, (TA,) occurring in 
a trad, of Safeeyeh, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) in which 
Mohammad is related to have used this 
expression, on the day of the return of 
the pilgrims from Mine, when he was told that 
she had her menstrual flux, to which he added, "I 
see her not to be aught but a hinderer of us; ” 
thus accord, to the relaters of traditions, each 
word being an inf. n., like a; (O, * TA;) of the 
measure or, as some say, the lS is to mark a 
pause; (Mgh;) and Ijae., (O, K,) which are also 
inf. ns.; (TA;) and this is accord, to the usage of 
the Arabs; (Az, TA;) being a form of imprecation, 
though not meant to express a desire for its 
having effect, (Az, Msb, TA,) for what is meant by 
it is only blame; (Msb;) expl. by <111 Ujicj 
(K,) i. e., [May God (exalted be He) 
wound her, &c., and] shave her hair, or afflict her 
with a pain in her throat: (TA:) or may her body 
be wounded ( jac), and may she be afflicted with 
a disease in her throat: (Mgh, O: *) so accord, to 
A’Obeyd: or may her leg and her throat be cut: or 
may her leg be cut and her head shaven: 
(Mgh:) [or may she be destroyed, and may her 
throat be cut:] or the two words lS J » and ^4^ 
are epithets, applied to a woman of ill luck; and 
the meaning is, (Z, O, TA,) she is one who 
extirpates [or destroys, and cuts the throats of,] 
her people, by the effect of her ill luck upon 
them; (Z, O, K, * TA;) being virtually in the nom. 
case, as enunciatives; i. e., ^ 4 (Z, 

TA.) Lh mentions the phrase, J, ^ Y 

isjic- i21il [app. meaning, Do thou not that: may 
thy mother be childless: (see cjjse : )] without 
explaining it: but he mentions it with the 


phrases •alii and 414* (TA.) Or J, 

signifies Having the menstrual flux. (K.) One says 
also, imprecating a curse upon a man, <1 liak.

He killed the beast which he was riding,

long detained the party, or people]. (S, O, TA.) 
And in the A it is said that a-iSjllj Cijic 
means Such a woman, or girl, came forth to the 
riders on camels, and they staid long in her 
presence; as though she hocked (cjjic.) the 
camels upon which they rode. (TA.) One says 
also J aa I had a want, and

together the camel's fore shank and his arm and 
bound them both in the middle of the arm with

say, JAh ciae, from ilkM, (S, O,) inf. n. Uj5*j, (O,) 
[i. e. I bound the camels in the manner expl. 
above,] this verb being with tesh-deed because of 
its application to a number of objects: (S, O:) and 
sometimes the hocks were bound with the Jlk. 
(TA.) The she-camel, also, was bound with 
the Jlk on the occasion of her being covered: —

I gave, or paid, the bloodwit to the heir, or next of

the camels [that constituted the bloodwit] used to 
be bound with the Jlk in the yard of the abode 
of the heir, or next of kin, of the slain person; and 
in consequence of frequency of usage, the phrase 
became employed to mean thus when 
the bloodwit was given in dirhems or deenars. 
(As, S, O, Msb. * [See a verse cited in the first 
paragraph of art. l -L c .]) And [hence] one says 
also, cJk ; (inf. n. as above, TA,) meaning I

a trad, related on the authority of I'Ab, (TA,) 
[meaning, accord, to an expl. of the verb when

bloodwit in certain cases shall not pay it for 
an intentional act of slaying or the like, nor for 
the slaying or the like of a slave,] applies, accord,

(S, O, Msb, K: [and thus as expl. in the Mgh:]) 
but, (S, O, Msb, K,) accord, to Ibn-Abee-Leyla, 
(S, O, Msb,) it applies to the case of a free 
person's committing a crime against a slave; for if 
the meaning were as Aboo-Haneefeh says, 
the phrase would be fk if- Jak V; (s, O,

third, therefore the portion is reduced to the half 
of what is due to the man: so accord, to Ibn-El-

camels, and for two of her fingers ten; and regard

one milks: (K:) or a bowl into which the she- 
camel is milked: or a £-4 of wood, or of skin and 
wood: or a vessel of skin, in the form of a bowl, 
with a wooden hoop: Az says, it is a piece of skin 
taken from the side of a camel's hide while it 
is fresh; it is made round, and filled with soft 
sand; then its edges are drawn together, and 
perforated with a wooden skewer, and it is bound 
so as to be closed, [thus] contracted, by a cord 
[passed through the holes made with the skewer], 
and left until it becomes dry and tough; then 
its upper part is cut off, and it stands by reason of 
its dryness, resembling a round bowl, as though 
it were carved out, or fashioned by the turner; the 
pastor and the rider suspend it, and milk into it, 


and drink out of it; and it is convenient to the 
man of the desert by its lightness, and its not 
breaking when the camel shakes it about or 
when it falls to the ground: (TA:) IAar says that 
this word and 344 and 4444 and 414“ all signify

the upper, cervical, tendinous portion of the 
trapezius muscle;] (S, O, K; [in all of which, 
mention is made of the *4c of the camel, to 
which it seems to be most commonly applied, 
and also to that of a man;]) it is one of a pair, and 
between one *4c and the other is the place 
of growth of the mane; (S, O;) Az explains it as 
specially applied to the thick and IAth, as 

the s-i~=>c in the neck, extending to the 
[or part between the two shoulder-blades]: ISd 
says that it is syn. with 44c [q. v .]: (TA:) [it is also 
said that] it signifies the 3c_ac [j. e . tendon, or 
sinew,] that extends in the neck: (Msb:) or the 
yellow 3c^ac in the side (3, -4--= ) of the neck; one of 
a pair: (A:) and the glj4c in a man are [said to 
be] the two yellow tendons or sinews

spine, on either side,] of the neck: (Zj in his “ 
Khalk el-Insan: ”) [but of all the meanings 
thus assigned to it, the first seems to be the most 
proper, or at least the most usual: see Q. Q. 1 :] 
the Arabs used to bind therewith, in the fresh, or 
moist, state, the u44 [or sheaths] of their swords, 
and also their spears when cracked, and it dried 
upon them, and became strong: (IAth, TA:) the 
word is masc., (Lh, TA,) or [it is masc. and fern., 
but] the making it fern, is preferred [though this 
is contr. to analogy]: (Msb:) the dual is glj4c (S, 
A, O, Msb) and u' 4c; (S, O, Msb, K;) [the former 
app. the more common, but the latter the more

of a man when he has become advanced in 
age, Jljll [The 44c of the man has 

become contracted]. (S, O.) The pi. UP*- is 

expl. in the K as signifying also Lead: and in the S 
as signifying lead, or a kind thereof: (TA:) El- 
Kutahee says, “I have been told that 34>l*]l 
signifies lead; but I am not sure of it: ” and Az 
says, “I know not any one who has said it, and it 
is not true; ” (O, TA;) and this is the case: 
(O:) MF observes that its explanation as 
signifying lead requires it to be a sing, of a pi. 
form, or a pi. that has no sing., like 4*4 
and -^14: (TA:) in a trad., mention is made of 
swords of which the ornaments were 344*11 
and (O, TA;) and the coupling of these two 
words together has led to the supposition that the 
former means lead; hut there is no evading the 
fact that it is the pi. of *44 meaning the of 
the camel. (TA.) fj4l ^j^ilc The best persons of 
the people, or party. (Sh, O, K.) 4 j51c A mark

the correctness of the latter verb; and the more so

34 *% is a prov., said to a man who is thereby 
enjoined to be content with a part of that 
which he wants, instead of the whole thereof; like 
him who rides the camel termed 3Jc one time 
after another time: [so that it means Be 
thou content, instead of the riding constantly, or 
instead of the beast that is ridden only, with the 
sending a camel to bring corn, upon which 
thou mayest ride occasionally:] (TA:) or the 
meaning may be, be thou content, instead of thy 
riding, with the hanging of thy goods upon the 
beast: or the meaning may be, be thou content, in 
respect of the beast that is ridden, with the 
hanging [thy goods] upon him in thy turn.

(S, O,) it is used as sing, and pi.; (S, O, K;) and its

therefore it is without tenween: but others say 
that its alif is to render it quasi-coordinate [to 
the quadriliteral-radical class], and is with 
tenween, the n. un. being »01c : (s, O:) IJ says that 
the alif in '43k is not to denote the fern, gender, 
because it is followed by »; but when they elide 
the », they say 4^, without tenween: (L, TA: [in 
both of which, more is added, but with some 
mistranscription or omission rendering it 
inconsistent:]) its twigs are slender, difficult to be 
broken, and brooms are made of it: (K: [but this

says, the 4 ^ i$ a tree [or plant] of which the 
greenness continues during the hot season, and 
its places of growth are the sands, and the plain, 
or soft, tracts: and he says, an Arab of the desert 
showed me a plant which he asserted to be 
the 4 ^°; having long and slender twigs, and 
delicate leaves; called in Pers. 64 [?]; those who 
collect [the dung used for fuel called] 313. make of 
it brooms for that purpose: to which he adds, and 
it is said, on the authority of the early Arabs, that 
the sl31c is a certain tree [or plant] which is found 
in the sands, green, having leaves, but in which is 
no good: (O:) [it is said, however, that] 
the decoction thereof is drunk for the dropsy. 
(K.) fffiic., (O, K,) like 4-3-4; (o,) in the 
saying 3111 64341, (O, K, * [in the 

CK |4 ~iU' r -,]) is a dial. var. of (k, [in the 

CK 6444,]) [and] is said by Ibn-Abbad to 
mean fik-al [i. e. May God utterly destroy 
their race, stock, or family]: but some say that it 
is a pi. of 44 signifying “ that which is precious, 
or held in high estimation: ” and in one dial, it is 
[ 4 ? 4 -,] with kesr to the cii. (o.) 3i3k : 
see 3j351c. 3514 : see 3314, in eight places. 65U [an 
imperative verbal noun], like J' ji & c., (IDrd, O, 
K, *) means <4*3, (K,) or 4*3 [i. e. Cling 
thou, cleave thou, or stick thou fast, to him, or it]. 
(IDrd, O.) <j54 A thing that is hung, or 


suspended, like the »3jc. [or amulet]. (TA 
voce 54 ** as an epithet applied to a child 
affected with the pain, of the 
fauces, termed »j34.) 64^ A thing that clings, 
cleaves, or sticks fast, (4*4, [in the CK 4*3,]) to a 

man. (S, O, K.) And [hence,] Death, or the 

decree of death; syn. 36*; (S, O, K;) as also J, 33514, 
(S, TA,) accord, to the K, erroneously, 33514 
[without teshdeed]: in a verse in which it occurs, 
some explain 335UJI as meaning thus; and some, 
as meaning the serpent, because of its clinging. 
(TA.) El-Mufaddal En-Nukree says, 36*4 4ik 3s j 
34*11 [when death, or the decree of death, had 
clung to Thaalebeh]. (S, O.) The pi. of 344 in 
this sense, and in the sense next following, as 
mentioned before, in the paragraph commencing 
with the word is 314, with two dammehs. 
(TA. See that paragraph.) — — And [hence,

occurs in a trad, in this sense, applied to what is 
termed sj3e., or to the operation performed upon 

it. (O, TA. [See 4 .]) See also 44. — Also 

Pasture upon which camels feed. (S, O, K.) 
And Trees that are eaten by the camels that have 
been ten months pregnant, (O, K,) in 

consequence of which they assume a red hue. 
(O.) El-Aasha speaks of it [in a verse of which I 
find four different read- ings] as occasioning a 
redness in she-camels: but some say that he 
means thereby The young in the bellies; and by 
the redness, the beauty of their colour on the 
occasion of conceiving. (S, O.) And some say that, 
as used by El-Aasha, it means The sperma of the 
stallion; a signification mentioned by AHeyth; 
because the she-camels become altered in 

colours, and red, when they conceive. (TA.) 

34^ 3SU1j li means There is not in the she-camel 
aught of milk. (S. [And 3^4 signifies the same: 
see an ex. voce 3314.]) — Also A she-camel that is 
made to incline (<-i4*3 [in the CK <-ik*3]) to a 
young one not her own, and will not keep to it, 
but only smells it with her nose, and refuses to 
yield her milk; (S, O, K; [see an ex. in a verse 
cited in the first paragraph of art. <3 j;]) as also 
1 4'*-“: (S:) or a she-camel that inclines to her 
young one, and feels it, until it becomes familiar 
with her, but when it desires to suck the milk 
from her, strikes it, and drives it away. (Ham p. 
206 .) [Hence,] one says of him who speaks a 
speech with which is no deed, 3461 3iiUi liklk 
[He dealt with us with the dealing of

Hence, cjliliill or cjlilAJJI The seven 
suspended odes; accord, to several writers: two 
reasons for their being thus called are 
mentioned in the Mz (49th £ 4); one, that “ they 


were selected from all the poetry, and written 
upon 3-44 (pieces of fine white cloth of 
Egypt) with water-gold, and suspended upon the 
Kaabeh; ” the other, that “ when an ode was 
deemed excellent, the King used to say, ' Suspend 
ye for us this, ' that it might be in his repository: ” 
that these odes were selected from all the poetry, 
and that any copies of them were 
suspended collectively upon the Kaabeh, has 
been sufficiently confuted in Noldeke's “ Beitrage 
zur Kenntniss der Poesie der alten Araber,” 
pp. xvii. — xxiii.: it is not so unreasonable to 
suppose that they may have been suspended 
upon the Kaabeh singly, at different times, by 
their own authors or by admiring friends, and 
suffered to remain thus placarded for some days, 
perhaps during the period when the city was 
most thronged by pilgrims; but the latter of the 
two assertions in the Mz seems to be more 
probable. — — Hence also p-4 1 3l*i> The

them is conventional, on account of 
their different dependencies, though He is 
declared to be free from the imputation of 
antecedent ignorance and from acquisition [of 
knowledge], for He knows what has been and 
what will he and how that which will not be 
would be if it were, his A being an eternal and 
essential attribute: when A denotes it

as syn. with it has a single objective 

complement: (Msb:) it has two objective 

complements in the saying, in the Kur [lx. 10], CA

particularly applied to that which is repeated and 
much, so that an impression is produced thereby

the conception of meanings; and sometimes it is 
used in the sense of fk/d when there is in it 
muchness: (TA:) you say, Aikl j jkJI and jfk

the inf. n. J, fkl is often used, as a simple subst.,

accord, to the latter reading mentioned above,)] 
from the higher, or highest, parts of Nejd, ( Of 
4-> 3H thus in some copies of the S and in the 
TA, but in other copies of the S the word 43 J$ 
omitted,) [at which there is no wondering, as at a 
thing that is improbable, nor any scoffing;] 
related [thus] with fet-h to the j and with damm 
thereto and with kesr thereto [i. e. ji as above

says also, 4° Ji 14 [app. 4°], meaning

or [the last word may be J, 4° or 44 or ji, for it 
may mean], of the higher, or highest, part of 
Nejd. (TA.) 3^: see the next preceding 

paragraph, in three places. 34: 
see 334. Jc.- gee 34. Ji is a particle and a noun 
(Mbr, S, Mughnee, K) and a verb; (Mbr, S;) 
though some assert that it is only a noun, and 
ascribe this assertion to Sb: (Mughnee:) its alif, 
(Sb, S, Msb,) [which, when it has no affix, is 
written 0 , and] which is originally j, (Sb, S,) [like 
that of 3J, q. v.,] is changed into [what is 
properly] o when it has a pronominal affix, (Sb, 
S, Msb,) as in 334, (Sb, S,) and 4 j 4; (Msb;) but 
some of the Arabs [in this case] leave it 


unchanged, as in the saying of a rajiz, 'JSi IjjUa 
41>14 jLi [They fled, or have fled, upon them, 
(referring to camels,) and flee thou upon her]; 
this, it is said, being of the dial, of Belharith Ibn- 

Kaab. (Sb, S.) As a particle, it has nine [or 

more than nine] meanings. (Mughnee.) As 
such, (Mughnee,) or, accord, to Sb, as a noun, 
(K,) it denotes 4>l*4YI [i. e. superiority] (Msb, 
Es-Subkee, Mughnee, K, TA) properly thus 
termed, (Msb,) such as is perceptible by sense; 
(Es-Subkee, TA;) either with respect to what is 
signified by the noun governed by it, and this 
is generally the case, (Mughnee,) as in the saying 
[in the Kur xxiii. 22 and xl. 80], 41111 Ji j 

[And upon them (referring to camels) and 
upon the ship, or ships, ye are carried]; 
(Mughnee, K;) or with respect to what is near 
thereto, as in the saying [in the Kur xx. 10], 4 4 
Jill Ji [Or I shall find near upon the fire, i. 
e. at the fire, a right direction]: (Mughnee:) and 
using it to denote oUUiuYI properly thus termed, 
you say, jLAll Ji CiiS [1 was upon the flat house- 
top]: (Msb:) [in like manner also,] as 

denoting that is perceptible by sense, it 

occurs in the saying [in the Kur lv. 26], 134 ji 
[Every one that is upon it (referring to the 
earth) is transitory]: (Es-Subkee, TA:) and you 
say, 33 Jc. [Upon Zeyd is, or was, a 
garment], Ji being here a particle; and 3 j Si 
33 [A garment was upon Zeyd,] Si being here a 
verb. (Mbr, S.) And it denotes oUUSuYt, likewise, 
tropically thus termed, (Msb, TA,) such as is 
ideal, or perceived by the intel-lect; (Msb, Es- 
Subkee, Mughnee, TA;) as in the saying 34 0 j 
33 (tropical:) [Zeyd, a debt is lying upon him, 
or incumbent on him, i. e. he owes a debt, JSi to 
such a one], that which is ideal being thus likened 
to that which is corporeal; (Msb;) and in the 
phrases 3' 44 and 34 31 i, meaning (tropical:) 
An affair, or a command, lies, or rests, upon us, 
or is incumbent on us, and so property, [as due 
from us, i. e.] the former as a duty and the latter 
as a debt, i. e. 431, like as the thing lies, or rests, 
(43),) upon the place; the latter phrase importing 
responsibility: and 34 Ji cAi is also said to 
mean ji [i. e. (assumed tropical:) property was, 
or became, much in quantify, or amount, upon 
him, app. as a burden imposing upon him 
responsibility]. (TA.) And it [likewise] denotes 
ideal in the phrase 34 Ji 31 (tropical:) 

[A crime, or an offence, committed upon (or 
here, as in many other instances, it may be 
rendered against) me is imputable to them]: 
(Mughnee:) and so in the saying [in the Kur ii. 
254 and xvii. 22], 33 Ji 343 LiiAa (tropical:)

over some]. (Es-Subkee, Mughnee, TA.) [See

K;) and so it is said to he used in the phrase, in a

every free man and slave, a saa], because the 
alms-gift of the breaking of the fast is 
not incumbent on the slave, but only on his 
master; (IAth, TA;) and so it is used in the 
[common] phrase, pj P [With (or 

notwithstanding) my being pleased, or well 

pleased, or content]. (Har p. 13.) It also 

denotes transition, (Mughnee, K,) like ip; 
(Mughnee;) as in the saying (of El-Koheyf El- 
'Okeylee, TA), <111 iP jP p ppj bl 

UlUj [when the sons of Kusheyr shall be

induce in me admiration, or 
pleasure], (Mughnee, K, * TA,) i. e. p ; 
(Mughnee, TA;) or it may be that ipj is made to 
imply the meaning of [which is trans. by 
means of J^]; (Mughnee;) or, as Ks says, it is 
made to accord with its contr. (Mughnee, 
TA,) by its being made trans. by means of P: 
(TA:) and so in the saying, 'aAi y l sy 'i aJ 3 P 
V) lilo [in a nigh in which we shall 
not see any one that shall report what will 
proceed from us, except its stars], i. e., '- ic ; or it 
may be said that PP is [here] made to imply the 

meaning of feui. (Mughnee.) It is also used 

to assign a cause, like J; as in the saying [in the 
Kur ii. 181], y^* <P “dll I (Mughnee, K,) 
meaning Aity [i. e. And that ye should 
magnify God for, or on account of, his rightly 
directing you]; (Mughnee;) [and in the same, vi. 
90, &c., I -dt- (iilUl 'i i. e . I will not ask of you

the first of any alighting:] and for what [or 
wherefore] do I ride him if I do not alight when 
called upon to do so? (Ham p. 29. \fP is here, as 

usually, for f ls^-]) It is also used in the 

sense of y [generally followed by a noun 
significant of time]; (S, Mughnee, K; *) as in the 
saying [in the Kur xxviii. 14], p P- JIaj 
■ dai [And he entered the city in, or during, a time 
of inadvertence]; (Mughnee, K;) and in the 


saying [in the same ii. 96], O^yai jlS U I jp\j 
jldL. blli jy meaning, PP pj P [i- e.

recited, in the time of, or during, the reign of

also say, on) a journey: in like manner also] aa! 

p. Ca jjy in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer El- 
Hudhalee, means, ylhll P [i. e. I have journeyed

an adverbial noun of time or place]; or it may be 
in the place of a denotative of state, meaning di 3

(Ham p. 37:) and you say of one who was desiring 
to rise and hasten, P ^50 [i. e. I found 

him in a state of haste: see P*j\. (TA.) [It 

also denotes conformity, accordance, adaptation, 
or agreement; as in the phrase, Ii* p P

fashion, or mould, of this; (see ^ 4 ^;) and in p

in the phrase in the Kur xxiv. last verse, p as 
■p pjjl Certainly He knoweth that state of 
conduct and mind to which ye are conforming 
yourselves; and in many other passages 
therein: thus also in the saying of Mohammad, 3 ^ 
SjLiSI Jc. j ] jj Every infant is born in a state 

of conformity to the natural constitution

agreement; in which, as in other exs. of the same 
kind, a verb or a part, n., (in the last, for 

instance, J_p-P or the like,) is understood. 

It also denotes a condition; as in the 
phrases, Ia£ p a^JU^ He made peace, or 
reconciliation, or a compromise, with him on the 
condition of such a thing, and Ia£ yi p on 

the condition of his doing such a thing. And 

there are various other usages of this 


prep, depending upon verbs or part. ns. 
expressed or obviously understood in connection 
with them, too numerous to be here collected. 
Many of these will be found among the 
explanations of words with which they occur.] 

It is also used in the sense of 0 -?; as in the 

saying, u^bll p I jUjSI lit, (S, Mughnee, K,) 

in the Kur [lxxxiii. 2], meaning, iy*ull y* [i. e. 
Who, when they take by measure from men, take 
fully], (S,) or, as in the T, u-«ull p [which signifies 

the same]. (TA.) It is also used in the sense 

of y; (S, Mughnee ; K;) as in the saying in the Kur 
[vii. 103], l3=^I VI aIII P Jjal V j! p t (Mughnee, 
K, *) meaning u 4 , (TA,) [i. e. That I should not 
say of God aught save the truth,] and Ubei read

say, P cL . ij [meaning ppj, i. e. I shot

last sentence, see more;]) and they said also, 

<111 glut p [meaning, yUl p, i. e. Mount thou in 
the name of God]: (Mughnee:) thus [too] it is 
used in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, P P& P 
^liall [expl. in art. uP, conj. 4,] 
meaning (S:) [and in the phrase p i. e. 
By his hand, or (assumed tropical:) by his 
means.] — — It is also used to denote 
an emendation, (Mughnee, K,) and a digression, 
or transition, (Mughnee,) like j£l; (TA;) as in the 
saying, « j 4 J <kJI V (Mughnee,)

not enter Paradise, because of the evilness of his 
deed, or conduct, or such a one is hell-doomed;

whom thou lovest is not endued with affection]: 
the poet invalidates by the first P his saying fla 
% U and then, by the second P, the clause 

immediately preceding it. (Mughnee.) It is 

also redundant, for the purpose of compensation;

P meaning Ajlc dp [i. e. Verily the

meaning of j ja [i. e. The location that is above, or

between two comings to water was

is cited in the S:]) or, accord, to As, meaning 0 * 
[from its vicinage]: and, used in this sense, as 
a noun, it admits before it no other prep, than O*.

incentive: (TA:) you say, 'kj >4^-, (S, K, TA,)

thou hold of Zeyd: (S, TA:) or keep thou, or 
cleave thou, to Zeyd: (K, TA:) and 1% keep 
thou to such a thing: (El-Munawee, TA in art. m:) 
[thus] it is said in a trad., i3'Jd [Keep thou to 

gentleness]. (El-Jami 1 es-Sagheer.) And [in 

like manner] you say, 1 -yj and 4 jj, meaning 

Give thou me, or present thou to me, Zeyd: (S, 
TA:) [or, more commonly, bring thou to me 
Zeyd:] you say, 1% d^-, meaning bring thou to

(K:) [accordingly, when used as a simple subst., it 
may be rendered Work, labour, or service: and a 
deed, or an action:] or it has a more particular 
meaning than 3*i; for it is a J*s [or deed] with a 
sort of difficulty; and therefore it is not attributed 
to God: or, accord, to Er-Raghib, it is any 3*s [i. e. 
deed or action] that proceeds from an animate 
being by his intention; and thus it has a more 
particular meaning than 3*a; for the J*s is 
sometimes attributed to animate beings from 
which it proceeds without intention; and 
sometimes to inanimate things, to which 
the J3 is seldom attributed; and this is not used 
in relation to [irrational] animals except [as 
implied] in the phrases 3 I J=- 3J and (Wjc j*j: 
or, accord, to MF, the J3 is a motion of the 
whole, or of a portion, of the body; and 
sometimes, of the mind; so that it is the utterance 
of a saying, as well as the doing a deed with the 
member, or limb, with which things are gained or 
earned; though most readily understood as 
applied particularly to the latter; and some apply 
it particularly to that which is not a saying: it is 
also said that a saying is not termed 33 in 
the common conventional language: and the 
truth is said to be, that it is not included in the 
terms 33 and 3*a otherwise than tropically: 
(TA:) [see also <4=-:] the pi. of 33 [used as a

Hakeem, (TA,) 33 “Gil ji 33 d <3 the last word

by ISd to be unknown to him, should by rule 


be 3*= [app. 3**], but it is 4 3*, deviating 
from rule; (TA;) or it means 3* 1 -**, and its sing, 
is [i. e. 4 »ULi] signifying a place of erring, or 
wandering from the right way: (Har p. 85:) in the 
K, 4-*4l is also expl. as signifying 343 [pi.

relaters of traditions j4 if j4s 0 f i>«, 
suppressing the word lSjj or or. jj“]: but 
this is said to be post-classical. (TA.) Q. Q. 1 04- 
laljill He put a superscription, or title, (0')4,) 
to the book, or writing; (S, * Msb;) or he wrote 
the u')4 of the book, or writing; (K;) like 4j4 ; 
(TA;) and ] 4c ; (S, K, TA,) aor. 630=-, inf. n. 0=-, 
(TA,) signifies the same; as also J, 44 ; (S, K, TA,) 
inf. n. o4j mentioned by Lh; (TA;) and 44, (S, 
K, TA,) formed by changing one of the u s [of j4] 
into l 5. (S, TA.) [See also Q. Q. 1 in art. >^.] if 
is used in three manners: — First, it is a prep.: 
and as such it has ten meanings. (Mughnee, K.) 

(1) It denotes transition; (Msb, Mughnee, 

K;) either sensibly or virtually; (Msb;) and the 
Basrees have mentioned no other meaning than 
this: (Mughnee:) or, as Sb expresses it, (Msb,) it 
denotes what has passed [or rather it denotes 
passage] from the thing [that is mentioned 
immediately after it]: (S, Msb:) Er-Raghib says 
that it necessarily denotes transition from that to 
the mention of which it is prefixed: and the 
grammarians say that it is applied to denote what 
has passed and become remote from thee. (TA.) 
Thus in the saying, 4!' jc CijiU. [1 journeyed 
from the country, or town]. (Mughnee, K. *) And 
in '4 if c4c j [I abstained from such a thing; 
and hence, I did not desire, or wish for, such a 
thing]. (Mughnee.) And jc Cnij [1 shot an 
arrow, or arrows, from the bow]; (S, 
Mughnee;) because by means of the bow one 


projects his arrow from the bow, and makes it to 
pass therefrom: (S:) but another meaning of this 
will be mentioned in what follows. (Mughnee.) 
And £ j?- if 4i*4l [I fed him so as to free him 
from hunger]; (S, Msb;) making hunger to be 
quitted, and passed from: (S, * Msb:) and in this 
case, O* is used in its place, (S, TA,) as in the Kur 
cvi. 3; (TA;) or the meaning in this instance 
is, because of hunger. (Jel.) And^icu jc c44., [as 
though] meaning I sat passing away from the 
place of his right side, in sitting, to another place 
[adjacent thereto: but see another explanation 
near the end of the paragraph]. (Msb.) 
And cs-4 oi jooil and [Turn thou, or go 

thou, away, or aside, from me]. (TA.) And >44.1 
4c ,4*JI I understood, or became acquainted with, 
[or acquired,] knowledge, or science, from 
him; as though the understanding passed from 
him. (Msb.) [And similar to this is the phrase <s j j 
j4 jc, for which j4s j4 alone (the verb 
being understood) is often used, He related a 
tradition or traditions &c. as learned, or heard, or 
received, from such a one, or on the authority 
of such a one. In many other phrases also, some 
of which will be mentioned in treating of if as 
syn. with if, the former of these two 
prepositions is to be, or may be, expl. as denoting 
transition. For ex., one says, 4c and jali He 
repelled from him; and hence, he defended him: 
(see art. j4:) and f«-4 He shot in defence of 
them: (see an ex. in a verse cited voce U**:) 
and 1-4 is sometimes used for 1-4 I4li> as in the 
phrase 14. cJila 1 fought in defence of him; i. e., 
repelling from him. But the instances of this and 
other usages of if, exclusive of those mentioned 
in this paragraph, depending upon verbs or part, 
ns. expressed or obviously understood, are far 
too numerous to be here collected: many of these 
will be found among the explanations of 

words with which they occur.] (2) It denotes 

a compensation; or something given, or received, 
or put, or done, instead, or in lieu, of another 
thing. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the 
Kur ii. 45], 144 i_>4 is- 3*4 is V Ujj I jiil 3 [And 
fear ye a day wherein a soul shall not give 
anything as a satisfaction for a soul, i. e. for 
another soul: or shall not make satisfaction for a 
soul at all; accord, to the latter rendering, 44; 
being put in the accus. case after the manner 
of an inf. n.]. (Mughnee, K. *) And in the saying 
in a trad., olii jc ^ ^ [Fast thou for, or in lieu 

of, thy mother]. (Mughnee.) (3) It denotes 

superiority (=4*44il [as used tropically]); 
(Mughnee, K;) i. e. as syn. with Jc- . (Mughnee.) 
Thus in the saying of Dhu-l-Isba’ El-'Adwanee, J 


jVlq ^14 clijl Vj ( _ 5 io - i... ^ diLjafll V 40- 3 jjI 
(S, Mughnee,) i. e. To God be attributed the 
excellence of the son of thy paternal uncle (the 
meaning being olic Jl jj -J), thou hast not 
become possessed of superiority, in grounds of 
pretension to respect or honour, above me, or 
over me, (J4,) nor art thou my governor that 
thou shouldst rule me; for the well-known mode 
is to say 4)4 diLJai l. (Mughnee.) [Thus too in the 
phrases 4c 4" and 4c 14 (expl. in art. 4^)* 
and in the phrase 4c jlj (expl. in art. J?-), and 
the like.] And thus it has been said to be used in 
the phrase [in the Kur xxxviii. 31], jo. Cu4i ^1 
fj j4 if meaning 44 4iia [i. e. Verily I 
have preferred the love of good things above, or 
to, the remembrance, or praise, of my Lord]: but 
it is also said that it is here used in its proper 
manner, as dependent upon a denotative of state 
suppressed; the meaning being, J j J4 'if- la f=- 
[i. e. turning away from the remembrance, &c.]: 
and AO is related to have said that 44LI is 
from 441, jj* 4I, signifying “ the camel lay down 
and did not become roused; ” and that the 
meaning is, I have become withheld by the love of 
good things from the remembrance, &c. 
(Mughnee.) And it is [said to be] used as 
denoting superiority or the like in the saying [in 
the Kur xlvii. last verse], 4 — 4 jc JI4 Uila [as 
though the meaning were He is niggardly only to 
himself ^^4, for Jc is considered in this 
case as importing an ideal superiority); but the 
phrase may be better rendered, agreeably with 
the proper, or primary, signification of if, he 
withholds, with niggardliness, only from himself; 

as is indicated by Bd]. (Mughnee, K.) (4) It 

denotes a cause. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in the 
saying [in the Kur ix. 115], jjl jliilLI jlS U3 

o jc 'f jc v il [And Abraham's begging forgiveness 
for his father was not otherwise than because of 
a promise]. (Mughnee, K.) And thus in the saying 
[in the Kur xi. 56], 4U ja jc UJi ^ jli J-j U3 
[And we are not, or will not be, relinquishers of 
our gods because of thy saying]: or the meaning 
may be, we do not, or will not, relinquish our 
gods, turning away (cWj-4^, as a denotative 
of state relating to the pronoun [implied] 
in j4 ) from thy saying; and this is the opinion 
of Z. (Mughnee.) [See also an ex. voce 0-4, 
last sentence.] — — (5) It is syn. with 4. (s, 
Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 
42], 0«*-4 O fo - 4.;' 4c ; (Mughnee, 

K,) meaning J# [i. e. After a little while, they 
will assuredly become repentant]. (TA.) And in 
the phrase [in the Kur lxxxiv. 19], if '44 j4J 
34 [expl. in art. 34], meaning 4U. ole 4U.

(Mughnee.) And in the saying, ip ^ jj Js-^j 
[A nd to many a watering-place have I come after 
a watering-place]. (Mughnee.) And in the saying 
of El-Harith Ibn-'Obad, p* LC'p U ja 
JUi. p Jjl j (S, * TA,) meaning [i. e. 

Make ye two to be near to me the place of the 
tying of En-Na'ameh (the name of a horse of the 
poet): the war of Wail has become pregnant after 
failing to be pregnant during a year, or years]. 
(TA.) And in the saying of Et-Tirimmah, fs -15 
Cp* i Cjip If- 1 j*-^- tit i. e. [All of them 

shall know that I am of full age, when they press 
forward] heat after heat. (TA.) — — (6) It 

denotes the meaning of the preposition 
(Mughnee, K.) Thus in the saying, Ip Vj 
til j aoUj]I J 4 *. [And be not thou remiss in bearing 
the responsibility of the obligation that thou 
takest upon thyself]; as is shown by the phrase, 
[in the Kur xx. 44], lS P P V j: (Mughnee, K:) 
so it is said; but it seems that the meaning of ^j 
^ CP is, “he passed from such a thing, not 
entering upon it; ” and P Pis, “he entered upon 
it but was remiss, or languid: ” by is meant 
the payment of a bloodwit or the like. (Mughnee.) 

(7) It is syn. with Cp . (Mughnee, K.) Thus in 

the saying [in the Kur xlii. 24], gjll > j 

p [And He is he who accepts repentance 
from his servants]. (AO, Mughnee, K.) Az 
mentions among the cases in which there is 
a difference between Cp and CP, that the former 
has adjoined to it a noun signifying what is near; 
and the latter, [one signifying] what is remote; as 
in one's saying ly-ik jila p [1 heard from 

such a one a narrative], and Cp p*^* 

[He related to me a narrative from such a one, a 
phrase similar to Cp* ip lS Is j, mentioned among 
exs. of the first meaning of Cp]: accord, to As, one 
says, Cp CP* meaning *p [i. e. Such a 

one related to me from such a one]; and Cp 
C p* and vP [I became diverted from such a one 
so as to forget him]: accord, to Ks, one says 
p only: and li* t-P as meaning ^ [i. 

e. From thee came this]. (TA.) (8) It is syn. 

with p. (Mughnee, K.) Thus [it is said to be used] 
in the phrase [in the Kur liii. 3], lsPP Cp '- i j 
[Nor does he speak with the desire of self- 
gratification]: (Mughnee, K:) but it seems that it 
is here used in its proper [or primary] sense; and 
that the meaning is, iSP ip p P j [nor 

does his speech proceed from desire of self- 
gratification; so the phrase may be well rendered, 
nor does he speak from the desire &c.]. 
(Mughnee.) One says also, 4*lj *)y. CP 1 j?-?- 1 , 
meaning ^Ij?^ [i. e. They replied with one 
reply]. (T, S, O, K, all in art, i jj.) And CP 1 jj'-k 
f* p-l [They came with the last of them; Cp being 
here syn. with p; meaning they came all, without 


exception]. (A in art. ji-l.) [And in like 
manner, f* pil CP f* jf 2 They slew them with the 
last of them; meaning they slew them all, without 

exception.] (9) It denotes the using a thing 

as an aid or instrument. (Mughnee, K.) Thus in 
the saying, gjjail Cp Ppj [I shot with, or by 
means of, the bow], accord, to Ibn-Malik; 
(Mughnee, K;) because one says also, p c p'j; 
both mentioned by Fr. (Mughnee.) [Another 
explanation of this phrase has been mentioned 

before.] (10) It is redundant, to compensate 

for another [i>] suppressed (Mughnee, K.) Thus 
in the saying, ^ Ulll pc, j\ jkii 

jjj p [Art thou impatient if the decreed 
event of death befall a soul? but why wilt not thou 
repel from, i. e. defend, that which is between thy 
two sides?]; (Mughnee, K;) the meaning 
being, j &jfy uS Cp (IJ, Mughnee;) P 
being suppressed before the conjunct noun fyr*!!], 
and added after it. (Mughnee, K.) And sometimes 
it is redundant without compensation, when 
conjoined with a pronoun: AZ says that the Arabs 
make ^ redundant in the phrase ^ I- -*4 
[meaning Take thou, or receive thou, this]: (TA:) 
[but ^ is expl. in the S and L, in art. as 
meaning i'jjllj ^ ^ j Jj5i U Ai. : see 1 in 
art. jjj':] anc j gilt iij| ; occurring in a trad., is expl. 
as meaning [i. e. Leave thou it]: (TA:) or this 
means go thou from thy place; pass thou from 
it. (L in art. J 4 j.) [See also the last ex. in this 
paragraph.] — The second manner of using it is, 
as a particle of the kind 
called is p^*, [combining with an aor. following 
it to form an equivalent to an inf. n.,] as is done 
by the tribe of Temeem, (Mughnee, K, *) in what 
is termed their ■ (K: [see R. Q. 1:]) they use it 
in the place of J; (S, Mughnee;) saying, ip ^ 4^1 
(Mughnee, K,) for u 1 [meaning Thy 
doing such a thing pleased me]. (Mughnee.) Dhu- 
r-Rummeh says, Juji p CiiLjj pi 

fjCP* iii p [j s thy having looked upon 

the traces of a place of abiding of thy beloved 
Kharka the cause that the water of excessive love 
is shed from thine eyes?]. (S, Mughnee.) And 
thus they do in the case of O'; saying, J pj 
ip - 4 ^' J. [I acknowledge, or declare, or testify, 
that Mohammad is the apostle of God]. 
(Mughnee.) — The third manner of using it is, as 
a noun, in the sense of (Mughnee, K, *) 
or (S:) and this is said to be in three cases. 

(Mughnee.) (1) It is when p is prefixed to 

it; and this is of frequent occurrence: (Mughnee:) 
as in the saying, pp ip p p £1; jU <^1 jl S3 
j l'p [And verily I see me to be like a ring for 
the spears to be aimed at, from the side of 
my right hand at one time, and from before me at 
another time]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the 


saying, ip p I came from the side of 
his right hand. (S.) In the opinion of Ibn- 
Malik, p prefixed to P is redundant; but accord, 
to others, it is used [as expl. above,] to denote the 
beginning of a space between two limits: these 
say that ip ciiSa means vpi pp*- P [i. e. I sat 
in the side of his right hand], either closely or 
otherwise; but if you say p [before ip], the 
sitting is particularized as being close to the first 

part of the lateral space. (Mughnee.) (2) It 

is also when Jc. is prefixed to it: (Mughnee:) thus 
in the saying, jikll Pp p^j ip jc. [On, or 
over, the side of my right hand, the birds passed 
along turning the right side towards me, or 
turning the left side towards me; the last word 
being a pi., accord, to analogy, of jyLy which is 
used in two opposite senses]: (Mughnee, K:) but 
this usage is extraordinary; no other instance of 
it than that here cited having been preserved. 
(Mughnee.) — — (3) It is also when what is 

governed by it in the gen. case and the agent of 
the verb in connection with it are two pronouns 
having one application: so says Akh: as in the 
saying of Imra-el-Keys, p ] p 

[or see the entire verse cited and 

expl. in art. j=j=-]: but it is shown to be not a noun 
in such a case by this, that may not take its 
place [unless used in a tropical sense]. (Mughnee. 
[See what has been said above, that ^ in a 
phrase of this kind is held to be redundant.]) ip 
for u': see the next preceding paragraph, last 
quarter, ip: see — — ip P ■'jj 

means the same as P CK p [i. e. Verily he enters 
upon every mode, or manner, of speech or the 
like]; and so Cp 3 s t*i. (TA.) see what next 
follows. 4jc The presenting, or opposing, oneself, 
with meddling, or impertinent, speech; with 
speech respecting that which does not concern 
him; (Msb, TA;) as also J, *ip, with fet-h, (Msb,) 

or l <P, with kesr. (TA.) fie p. ajjLc. 1 , (S,) 

or ■p ip, imperfectly deck, and sometimes ip 
(K,) means I gave to him distinguishing him 
particularly from among his companions: (S, K:) 
from 5*^ signifying “ the presenting, or opposing, 
oneself. ” (TA.) And one says, *p ip (S) 
or (K) I saw him just now, (S, K, TA,) 
presenting, or opposing, himself, (TA,) without 
my seeking him. (S, TA.) And U gjjl U jj*j Ciiiel 
P : see 4. (S, K.) — It is also the subst. from ip 
p [j. e . a subst. signifying The state 
of being pronounced by the judge to be 
incapacitated from going in to his wife, or to have 
no desire for his wife: or of being withheld from 
her by enchantment, or fascination]: (S, Msb, * 
K:) or incapacity to go in to women: (Mgh, Msb:) 
or undesirousness of women: (Msb:) a word used 
in this sense by the lawyers; (Mgh, Msb;) who

[BOOKI.] 


say, (Msb:) but it is declared to be a low 

word, not allowable; (Mgh, Msb;) instead of 
which one should say J, 02*3, (Mgh,) or, accord, to 
Th and others, J. Cp, and J, 4A-, and accord, to 
the Bari', j. PP-. (Msb:) [i. e.] j A4 signifies 
undesirousness of women: (S:) or, as also J, Pp, 
and l PP, and J, uA, and J, 4A 3 , (K,) and 
I PP, (TA,) it signifies thus, or non- 
performance of the act of going in to women, by 
reason of impotence. (K, TA.) — Also An 
enclosure (S, Mgh, Msb, K) made of wood, (S, 
Msb, K, TA,) or of trees, (TA,) for camels, (S, 
Mgh, K, *) or for camels and horses, (Msb,) or for 
camels and sheep or goats, to he confined 
therein: (TA:) or an enclosure at the door of a 
man, in which are his camels and his sheep or 
goats: (Th, TA:) pi. iP (S, K) and ijp. (K.) V 
A P yfil pP [Two (app. meaning stallion- 
camels) will not he together in an enclosure for 
camels] is one of their sayings. (TA.) And one 
says, -ciill (ji Like the hrayer (meaning 

the braying stallion-camel) in the enclosure of 
trees, in which the stallion-camel is sometimes 
confined to prevent him from covering; such a 
stallion being hence termed J, up, originally 
1 CP: (Meyd:) it is a prov., applied to a man 
(Meyd, TA, and S and A and K in art. j J») raising 
a cry and clamour, (S, K,) or threatening, (TA,) 
who does not make his saying, or action, to have 
effect; (S, * Meyd, K;) like the camel that is so 
confined, prevented from covering, and brays. (S, 

K.) It is also said, by El-Bushtee and in the 

K, to signify A rope; and in a verse of El-Aasha, in 
which he mentions flesh-meat as put 
upon the CP, this last word has been expl. as 
meaning ropes which are stretched, and upon 
which is thrown the flesh-meat that is cut 
into strips, or oblong pieces, and dried in the sun: 
but Az says that the right meaning is, the 
enclosures for camels; that he had seen 
such enclosures in the desert, thus called because 
facing the direction whence blows the north 
wind, to protect the camels from the cold of 
that wind; and that he had seen the people 
spread the flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong 
pieces, and dried in the sun, upon them: he 
thinks that the word was expl. as meaning ropes 
hy one who had seen the poor of the sacred 
territory extending ropes in Mine, and putting 
upon them the flesh of the victims of sacrifice 

that had been given to them. (TA.) Also A 

booth by means of which one shades himself, 
made of panic grass (A) or [probably a mistake 

for and] branches of trees. (IB, TA.) And 

Reeds, or plants or herbage, which a man 


collects, to give, as fodder, to his sheep or goats: 
one says, * pr. pj A [He came with, or 
brought, a great collection of reeds, &c.]. (TA.) 
And one says, Al a? A P A and A> and A i. 
e. We were in abundant herbage. (TA.) — Also 
The u'A (thus [correctly, as will be shown by an 
explanation in what follows, confirmed by an ex. 
from a poet,] in more than one of the copies of 
the K, in the CK uA in the copy of the K 
followed in the TA j, and in the L iA j,) of the 
cooking-pot: (K, TA:) MF read lAj, and 
conjecturally, and from analogy, supposed it [to 
be Aj and] to mean PP; but the word is 
arabicized from the Pers. uA- 3 , [correctly u A- 3 , 
pronounced degdan,] a name for the thing upon 
which the cooking-pot is set up; and thus it [i. 
e. A.] is expl. in the M and other lexicons 
[among which may he mentioned the L]: hence 
the saying of a poet, <j. j'y j A A »Ut jj t c lie 
A* At Ad i cAj ja [it (the A, or place of

the tents to keep off the torrent, and the place of

stones that formed that support, in a state

A poet (cited by Fr, TA) says, If- U jill Ua

said to mean, [And they did not take it, or her, or 
them,] by concession, and obedience, [arising 
from love, or affection,] without fighting: [but the 
smiting of the Mesh-rafee sword demanded the 
renouncing thereof:] 'Abd-El-Kadir Ibn-'Amr El- 
Baghdadee asserts the meaning of to be 
submission and concession; adducing as evidence 
thereof this verse; attributing the contr. meaning 
to the vulgar: both, however, are correct; and that 
first mentioned occurs repeatedly in traditions: 
but the most learned Yakoot Er-Roomee, in 
his Moajam, says that the verse above-cited may 
be rendered as meaning and they did not take it, 
or her, or them, by superior power attended by 
[or in consequence of] love, or affection: but they 
did so by fighting: and that this may be regarded 
as indicated by the poet's saying L» jPJ; 
for otherwise he would have said, L* Ua: and 
he says, it is a matter of common consent 
that signifies force, and superior power. 

(TA.) It is also a subst. from Do in the first

Lowliness, humility, or submissiveness:] (Mgh,

the heart of the palmtree: and the heart is injured 
by the cutting of those that are near to it;

ordering a person to bring him a palm-branch

becoming benighted, in the desert, to howl, in 
order that the dogs, if any person by whose 
presence he might be cheered were near him, 
might hear, and reply to him, and he might 
be guided by their howling: so this man howled, 
and the wolf came to him, whereupon he said 
thus: it relates to the seeker of succour from him 
who will not succour him. (Meyd, * TA.) And it is 
said in a trad., Jkl J»l Vp jji Jl£ e.

metaphorically as meaning he suffered distress, 
and complained; from the tdjp of the dog: (Har p.

relation to the wolf and the dog. (TA.) And 
one says of him who is esteemed, or found to be,

does not howl nor does he bark]. (Ham p.

[a mistake for sets, aurorally, (see J 4 s ; n 

art. J jj,)] in the tail, or latter part, of the cold, as 
though it were howling (e s 4 4) after it, driving 
it away, wherefore they call it 44: (TA:)

star that is on the edge of the left shoulder of 
Virgo, which is the Thirteenth Mansion of the 
Moon: or, accord, to some, the stars that are 
upon her belly and beneath her armpit; as though 
they were dogs howling ( ls 4) behind the Lion; 
so called because of the vehemence of the cold; 
for when they rise or set [aurorally], they bring 
cold. (Kzw in his Descr. of Virgo.) And (assumed

without the figure is a red, bright star, 


between his thighs, [i. e. Arcturus,] called >4uUl 
44', and, by the Arabs, i4_4 and 44

whom he is desirous of marrying, saying, Art 
thou in want, (and the gift appearing from thee

a dowry, some whereof the [quick] driver will

in iv. 3 ;) [meaning] it rose [above], (S, O, Msb, 
K,) or exceeded, (K,) in the reckoning, (Msb, K,) 
[the regular sum of the fixed primary portions,] 
i. e., its [fixed primary], portions exceeded [the 
regular sum thereof], occasioning a diminution to 
the sharers: (S, Mgh, O, Msb:) 43*4 in this case 
being the contr. of Jjll [which I do not find in any 
lexicon, but only in dictionaries of conventional 
terms]. (Msb.) Az relates, of El-Mufaddal, that, 
application having been made to him respecting 
[the shares of inheritance of] two daughters and 
a father and a mother and a wife, said, “Her [the 
wife's] eighth has become a ninth: ” and A' 
Obeyd says, he meant that the [primary] portions 
had exceeded [the regular sum] so that there fell 
to the wife the ninth, whereas in the original case 
she would have had the eighth; for if the 4^=jja 
had not exceeded [the regular sum], it would 
have consisted of four and twenty; but when it 
[so] exceeded, it became of seven and twenty; 
and there pertained to the two daughters the two 
thirds [of four and twenty], i. e. sixteen portions; 
and to the father and the mother the two sixths, i. 
e. eight portions; and to the wife three reckoned 
as of seven and twenty, i. e. the ninth, whereas, 
before the exceeding, it would have been three 
of four and twenty, i. e. the eighth: and this 
question is called yiUf because 'Alee was 

asked respecting it when he was on the pulpit, 
and said, without premeditation, “Her eighth has 
become a ninth. ” (TA.) Hence the saying, in a 
trad. of Maryam, [i. e. the Virgin 
Mary, respecting a story to which allusion is 
made in the Kur iii. 39 , (see a note on that verse 
in Sale's Translation,)] sfyAj 4143 i. e.

Arakim, mentioned two verses before,) have 
asserted that all who have hunted the wild ass are 
the sons of our paternal uncles, and that we are 
the relations of them; =V jll being for 44 j 4=4

false: (AHeyth, O, TA:) Nuseyr cites the poet 
Aboo-Amr El-Asadee as applying 
this appellation to asses; and says that camels are 
not so called unless employed for bringing
