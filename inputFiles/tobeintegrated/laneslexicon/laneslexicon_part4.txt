PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 


QJi 


The twelfth letter of the alphabet; called It is 
one of the letters termed k- [or non-vocal, i. 
e. pronounced with the breath only, without the 
voice]; and of the letters termed kikJ, as also 
and j, because proceeding from the tip of the 
tongue: its place of utterance is between that 
of o° and that of j: and Az says hat it is never 
conjoined with either of these two letters in any 
Arabic word: (TA:) it is a sibilant letter; and is 
distinguished from by the raising of 

the tongue to the palate [in the utterance of the 
latter], and from j by the suppression of the voice 
[in the utterance of the former]. (K in art. us**.) It 
is one of the letters of augmentation [occurring in 
the form i and its derivatives]. (S and L in 
art. us**.) [See also us** in art. os**. It is sometimes 
substituted for u* 3 ; as in >**, for and for u*, 
as in for gjjluS: (see De Sacy's Chrest. 

Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 230-233: and iii. 530-532:)] 
and AZ says that some of the Arabs substitute for 
it *^*, (S and L and K * in art. 0#“,) as in the saying 
(S and L in art. us**) of 'Alya Ibn-Arkam, (L ib.,) I* 
tUci Ijxuj! cjuil jljU us AfJI t&js 

**LjSi V j [O, may God remove far from good, or 
from prosperity, the sons of the Sialah, 'Amr Ibn- 
Yarbooa, the worst of mankind: they are not 
chaste, nor sharp in intellect]: he means u“L^ 
and (S and L ib.:) and in like manner one 

says cjLiL for u*k. (TA in art. ciyS.) o*s in the 

Kur [commencing ch. xxxvi.] is like and ^ at 
the commencement of chapters of the same; and 
is said by Tkrimeh to mean o'* 1 *! Ls [O man]; 
because it is followed by the words 0*1 kljl 
usl**j*lf (S and L in art. us**:) or it means either 
thus, or 4“ [O man of dignity]. (K in art. us**.) 
— 0“ is a particle peculiarly prefixed to the aor., 
rendering it clearly denotative of the future, 
(Mughnee, and S * and L * in art. us**,) as in J*k** 
[He will do such a thing], (S and L ib.,) and 
considered as forming a part thereof, for which 
reason it does not exercise any government upon 
it: it is not contracted from *-•>*, contrary to what 
the Koofees hold: nor is the extent of the future 
with it shorter than it is with ( -*j**, contrary 
to what the Basrees hold: the analytical 

grammarians term it u*sf“ by which is 

meant a particle of amplification; because it 


changes the aor. from the strait time, which is the 
present, to the ample time, which is the future: 
but plainer that their expression is the saying of Z 
and others, [that it is] a particle denoting the 
future. (Mughnee.) Kh asserts that it corresponds 
[as an affirmative] to [the negative] u. (S and L 
in art. us**.) Some assert that it sometimes 
denotes continuance, not futurity: this is 

mentioned in relation to the saying in the Kur [iv. 
93], [as though meaning Ye 

continually find others]; and they adduce as an 
evidence thereof the saying in the same [ii. 
136], (jc. (tiVj Li pjill c fyiln' l Jja)** [as 
meaning The light-witted of the people 
continually say, What hath turned them away, or 
back, from their kibleh?]; affirming that this was 
revealed after their saying U : but this the 
grammarians know not; and that this verse 
was revealed after their saying j is not a fact 
agreed upon: moreover, if it be conceded, still 
continuance is inferred from the aor.; like 
as when you say, 1 and £**k>j ; 

you mean that it is his custom to do thus. 
(Mughnee.) Z asserts that when it is prefixed to 
a verb signifying what is liked or disliked, it 
denotes that the event will inevitably happen: i. 
e., when it is prefixed to a verb signifying a 
promise or a threat, it corroborates and confirms 
its meaning. (Mughnee.) — [As a numeral, u* 
denotes Sixty.] L** L* i. q. q. v. m 1 ** 1 ■'*'**, (S, 
M, K,) aor. A L“, (M, K,) inf. n. s*t*“, (S, M,) 
He throttled him, syn. kajk.; (S, M, IAth, K;) i. e., 
squeezed his throat: (IAth:) or, so that he died, 
(S,) or so that he killed him. (M, K.) — — 
And <1** He widened it; namely, a kli-* [or skin for 
water or milk]. (S, K.) — ^ >111 u* ki**, (M, K,)

K,) for wine: (M:) or such as is large: (M, K:) or 
a ijj of any kind: (M:) or a receptacle of skin, or 
leather, in which the Jj is put: (M, K:) the former 
also occurs in a verse in which it is 
read without », for the sake of the rhyme: (M:) 
and its pi. is m j>L: (s, M, K:) and (so in the S, but 
in the K “ or,”) the latter (**1***) signifies a skin 


for honey; (S, K;) and in a verse of Aboo-Dhu- 
eyb, (S, M, K,) cited voce (s, m,) it is 
written k*U**, (S, M, K,) without <*: (S, M:) and it 
signifies also a skin in which clarified butter is 
put. (S and L voce ~k**>.) gkj**, in the following 
saying, (IJ, M,) JL-* u'sjkl kil, meaning Verily he is 
one who pastures, or tends, the cattle, and takes 
care of them, and manages them, well, (IJ, M, K, 
*) is from kiU* signifying “ a Jj ” because the iij 
is made only for the preservation of its 

contents. (IJ, M.) ski***: see 4k**. Also, (K,) 

applied to a man, (TA), Who drinks much water. 
(K.) k** 1 ijl“: see 1 in art. A***. 4 signifies The 
hastening, or being quick, in journeying; (S, K;) 
and is mostly used in relation to journeying by 
night: (S:) or the journeying all the night; (M;) or 
the journeying in the night without alighting to 
rest; (Mbr, S, K;) and 4-yjL* signifies the “ 
journeying in the day without alighting to rest: ” 
(Mbr, S:) or the journeying of camels night and 
day (AA, S, M, K) together. (M, K.) And 1 
occurs [as an inf. n. in the sense of k-J]; but [ISd 
says] I know not any verb [properly] belonging to 
it. (M.) — — You say also, k**l He 

prosecuted the journey with energy, (M,) or 
persistently, or continually. (MA.) [See an ex. in a 
verse of Aboo-Duwad cited voce uj J j*“.] -L** [an 
inf. n. of which the verb is not mentioned,] The 
act of walking, or going any pace on 
foot. (M.) k** : see 4, above. kjk Somewhat

the [which is similarly described as a skin, 
or small skin, of the kind called iij]: (El-Ahmar,

meaning a large [skin of the kind called] 3 j.

upon it: or of one unmixed colour: this last is 
[said to be] the correct meaning [in many 
instances]; but the sheykh Welee-ed-Deen El- 
'Irakee says, in the Expos, of the “ Sunan ” of 
Aboo-Dawood, respecting a pair of boots of the 
Prophet, described as or 

that this phrase seems to mean A pair of black 
boots of one unmixed colour; the last word being 
used in this sense in the common conventional 
language; though he had not found it with this 
meaning in the lexicons, nor in the books of 
authors on the strange words occurring in 
traditions. (TA.) — — Also Free from self- 
constraint: and one who knows not badness, 
wickedness, deceit, or guile; in whom is no 
latent rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, nor

simple or artless] in nature or disposition. (TA in 

art. jr^.) 34.314 also written is 

used by authors on the scholastic theology of the 
Muslims as meaning An argument, a plea, an 
allegation, an evidence, or a testimony, that is 
undecisive: and sometimes the same epithet is 
used [in like manner] in other cases. (L.) — In 
some copies of the K, it is said to be [the name 
of] Certain roots and shoots, that grow in waters, 
useful for such and such things; arabicized 
from [or »A4] ; (TA:) or certain leaves 
and shoots, (O, CK,) used as a medicine, having a

to malabathrum, or Indian spikenard;] growing 
in waters that collect and stagnate in black 
muddy lands, (O,) standing up on the surface of 
the water, (O, CK,) like the plant called if^,

the bottom of the vessel from which he has

only other instance of the kind:] by rule it should

allowable: (K:) but MF denies this; (TA;) or it 
may be [regular] from or [irregular]

M, Msb,) whether little or much; (T, Msb;) and of 
men, or people: (Sgh; Msb:) not the whole, or all, 
as many imagine it to mean, (Sgh, Msb, 
K,) though people use it in this latter sense, 
(IAth,) which Sgh asserts to be a vulgar error: 
(Msb:) it occurs repeatedly in trads., and always 
in the former sense: (IAth:) or it is sometimes 
used [in chaste Arabic] in the latter sense: (K:) 
and is correctly so used accord, to AAF and J 


and IJ and ElJawaleekee and IB, the last of 
whom confirms this signification by many 
examples and evident proofs: but whether, in this 
sense, it is derived from as AAF and J and 
others hold, or from jj P the “ wall which 
surrounds a town or city,” as others hold, is 
disputed: (TA:) and is a dial. var. 

of 1 jjUj. (S in art. j#“.) An Arab of the desert 

became the guest of a party, and they ordered the 
female slave to perfume him; whereupon he 
said, lS lS [My belly perfume 

thou, and the rest of me leave thou]: (K:) but in 
other lexicons than the K, we find <s I (TA in 
art. jA^.) This saying is a well-known prov. (TA.) 
[In the TA it is added that lS > 1-“ here signifies the 
whole of me, or all of me: but this is an evident 
mistake.] You say this to a man who gives you 
what you do not want, and refuses you what you 

want. (Sgh, TA in art. jl=>t.) It is related, 

also, that a hostile attack was made upon a 
people, and they cried out for aid to the sons 
of their uncle; but these held back from them 
until they had been made captives and taken 
away; then they came inquiring respecting them; 
and the person asked replied, J 1 j ^ j pjP' 1 jAAl 
[What, all the day, when the noon has

remote, (^ Li, (S, K, TA, in a copy of the S and in 
one of the K and in the CK '->>,) when [reason 
for] despair hath become manifest to thee: 
for when one wants the whole day, and the noon 
has passed, he must despair like as he despairs of 
accomplishing his want at sunset. (S in 
art. jj^, and K.) This saying is a prov.; (S, A;) and 
is used with reference to a thing which one hopes 
to attain when its time has passed. (A.)

misunderstanding of the latter prov.

him, interrogated him, questioned him, 
or inquired of him, respecting such a thing: 
but I CP is more common than IjSj; when 33 
means the asking, or demanding, of property, it 
is trans. [only] by itself or by means of a? [so that 
you say liS <J3 and liS <i« J3 meaning he asked, 
or demanded, of him such a thing]: (Er- 
Raghib, TA:) and one says also 33, aor. 33j ; 
(Akh, S, M, Msb, K,) like ' — aor. — (Msb, 
K;) which is of the dial, of Hudheyl; the medial 
letter of this being originally j, as is shown by the 
phrase, mentioned by AZ, uVj3jj Ua : (TA:) 
[respecting this dial, var., see what follows:] 
the imperative (S, Msb, K, TA;) of 33 (S, Msb, 
TA) is L&!; (S, M, Msb, K, TA;) and (S, K, &c.) 
that of 33, (S, Msb, TA,) 3-, (S, Msb, K, 
TA,) dual. 5L«, and pi. tjt*, [these two being] 
irregular; (Msb;) and AAF mentions that Aboo- 
'Othman heard one say 3-4, [a form omitted in 
some copies of the K, but mentioned in the CK,] 
meaning 33), suppressing the «, and transferring 
its vowel to the preceding letter, like as some 
of the Arabs said j3J for >371 [as many do in 
the present day]: (M:) accord, to ISd, (TA,) the 
Arabs universally suppress the » in 
the imperative except when they prefix to it 3 
or j; (M, TA;) saying J3'i and tltlj: (TA:) or 
when j [or 3] is prefixed, it is allowable 
to pronounce the « and also to suppress it, as in 
saying Ijillilj and Ij3j; (Msb:) and for the 
pass. 33, one may say 3“, and 33, in this 
instance making the kesreh to partake of the 
sound of dammeh, and and also 33, in 
which the middle letter is pronounced with a 
sound between that of » and that of lS, or 
resembling that of j. (IJ, TA.) As Er- 
Raghib says, 33“ signifies The asking, or 
demanding, knowledge, or information, or what 
leads thereto: and the asking, or 

demanding, property, or what leads thereto. 
(TA.) CP <33 means I asked of him 

information respecting the thing: (IB, TA: [and 
the like is said in the Msb:]) and <33 [is 
sometimes used in the same sense, as has been 
shown above, but generally] means I asked him 
to give me the thing: (IB, TA:) you say, VU <13 He 
asked, demanded, or begged, of him property, 
and in like manner, <“ J3 and -44) 33 [followed 
by ^fU]: (MA:) and -4aUll <111 cJL., inf. n. 33“ 
and <H3i, i begged, or sought, of God health, or 
freedom from disease, & c. (Msb.) The saying 
in the Kur [lxx. l], 3-3 3)3 3— means ip 

33 [i. e. An asker asked respecting a falling 
punishment]: (S:) [for] one says, ip 33j Ulji. 
Cp* and Cp*i [meaning We went forth asking 
respecting such a one]: (Akh, S:) or the phrase in 


the Kur means a caller called [for a 
falling punishment]: (TA:) and some read 33 
3)3 ( (Bd, TA,) [likewise] from 
(Bd:) or this means j 33; j 3— [i. e. a valley 
flowed with a falling punishment]; (Bd, TA;) so 
some say; (TA;) from (Bd.) The saying, in 

a trad., 3 I >JI Yj& ip ^ [He (Mohammad) 
forbade much questioning or inquiring] is said to 
relate to subtile questions or inquiries, that are 
needless; like another trad., mentioned below, 
voce, <J3i ; or to the begging, of men, their 
property needlessly. (TA.) 3 <33, (m, TA,) inf. 
n. <333 (TA:) see 1, first sentence. Aboo-Dhu- 
eyb says, 3 oSUl cp 3)3 fl 3 jlill j 3i3i 
ip [Didst thou ask the remains of the 
dwelling, or didst thou not ask, respecting the 
inhabitants, or respecting their knowledge of the 

former occupants?]. (M, TA.) In the saying 

of Bilal Ibn-Jereer, jl f33= 3 “j33 <3 
f«33 [when thou becomest their guest, or askest 
of them, thou findest with them a ready 
excuse], fi33 is a combination of two dial, vars.; 
the * being in the original phrase 3 j 333, and 
the lS being a substitute in the phrase 3 3 3)3; 
the measure of fi33 being fs33a : (M, K: *) so 
said Ahmad Ibn-Yahya, [i. e. Th,] who had at first 
ignored the expression: (M:) and it is an instance 
of which we know not a parallel in the language. 
(M, K. *) — — [Accord, to analogy, <33 also 
signifies He asked him, &c., being asked by him, 
&c. — — And Freytag states that Reiske 
has explained 3'—- as meaning He always 
demanded that another should express wishes for 
his health: but I know not any instance of its 
being used in this sense.] 4 <!>« <131 _[ <141, (k,) 
or i Ajiy-j, (s,) and \ <313, (s, K,) He 
accomplished for him his want. (S, K.) 5 333, in

classical.] 6 tj *33 They asked, or begged, one 
another. (S, Msb, K.) You say, ,j7i33j 3*, (M,)

In the Kur [iv. 1], some read 0 j 33 j jill <111 I jiilj

originally the meaning is, [And fear ye 

God,] by Whom ye demand [one of another] your 
rights, or dues: (M:) or by Whom ye ask, or 
demand, one of another; (Bd, Jel;) saying, I ask 
thee, or beg thee, by God; and I beseech thee, or 
adjure thee, by God. (Jel.) — — One says 
also f>j“ 1 jl *33, meaning They [together] asked, 
or begged, the people. (Mgh in art. 33) 3>“, (S, 
M, K;) also pronounced 3 3“, without «, (S, K,) [A

people ask or beg; (S;) or a thing that one has

of 3j3, like as £jj4 is of £35, and <jj 5 of 4j5,

the Kur [xx. 36], 4 31 yL Cyjji ja Thou hast 

been granted thy petition, or the thing that thou 
hast asked, O Moses. (S, M, TA.) In the saying

10], where it is said, ^ 331' 3j [And as for 
the beggar, thou shalt not chide him, or address 
him with rough speech]: or, accord, to El-Hasan, 
it here means the seeker of 
knowledge. (TA.) <13i ; an inf. n. of 1, is tropically 
used in the sense of a pass. part. n. [with the 
noun qualified by it understood; meaning 
(tropical:) A thing asked; i. e. a question; a 
problem, or proposition; a matter, or an affair, 
proposed for decision or determination]: (TA:)

cannot be attributed to God, because He knows 
not fatigue, and rest is only after fatigue and

(IAth, K, TA:) and of another belonging to Jaafar

K) one performs the act termed £jj4j 1I [meaning 
the repetition of the praises of God, 
generally consisting in repeating the words 4444 
<J1I thirtythree times, <4 =4411 thirty-three times, 
and jjSI <UI thirty-three times, which is done by 
many persons after the ordinary prayers, as a 
supererogatory act]: (S, A, Msb, K:) its 

appellation implies that it is an Arabic word; 
but Az says that it is post-classical: its pi. is j44 
(Msb) and ==Uj4 also. (Har p. 133.) See 2, last 

sentence but one. Also Invocation of God; 

or supplication: (K:) and prayer, (A, Msb,) 
whether obligatory or supererogatory: (Msb:) or 
supererogatory praise; (S;) and 
supererogatory prayer; (S, A, Mgh, K;) because of 
the j44j therein. (Mgh.) You say, <=4411 jSla,

<111 <=44, (IAth, K, TA,) with damm, (TA, [but in 
my MS. copy of the K written <4=4, and so in 
the CK,]) means (assumed tropical:) The 
greatness, or majesty, of God: (IAth, K, TA:) or 
[the pi.] 444-1I, occurring in a trad., 
means (assumed tropical:) the greatness, or 
majesty, and the light [or splendour], of God: 
(Msb:) or by the saying 4)4 yL j c=U=4, with 
damm to the i> and *-=, is meant (assumed 
tropical:) the greatness, or majesty, of the face of 
our Lord: (S:) or <HI <4j CjU 44 means (assumed 
tropical:) the lights [or splendours], (K,) or, 
accord, to ISh, the light [or splendour], (TA,) of 
the face of God: (ISh, K, TA:) some say 
that <4jll CiUlL means (assumed tropical:) the 
beauties of the face; because, when you see a 
person of beautiful face, you say, <111 4444 [to 
express your admiration]: and some, that [when 
it relates to God] it denotes a declaration of his 
being far removed from every imperfection; 
meaning <$4j 4444. (TA. [See 4444.]) One says, 
[addressing God,] e=j4l' -1=1=44 411141, with 

two dammehs, meaning (tropical:) [I ask Thee] 
by the evidences of thy greatness, or majesty, [or 
of the greatness, or majesty, of thy glorious face,] 
by the acknowledgement whereof thy praise is 
celebrated. (A.) — — ==14=411 also signifies 

(assumed tropical:) The places of prostration 
[probably meaning in the reciting of the Kur-an]. 


[BOOK I.] 

(K.) — Also, i. e. [the sing.,] 444, A piece 
of cotton. (TA.) 4444 is the inf. n. of as syn. 
with j44 [q. v.]; (K, TA;) and is a subst. that 
[sometimes] stands in the place of the inf. n. of 
the latter of these verbs, i. e. in the sense of =44-4 

(T, TA.) 4444 is a proper name in the sense 

of j=4“11l, and [for this reason, and also because it 
ends with I and 4,] it is imperfectly deck, and is 
also invariable; being put in the accus. case in the 
manner of an inf. n. (Mgh.) You say 411 41=44, 
meaning I declare [or celebrate or extol] the 
remoteness, or freedom, of God [from every 
imperfection or impurity, or from everything 
derogatory from his glory, i. e.] from 
the imputation of there being any equal to Him, 
or any companion, or anything like unto Him, or 
anything contrary to Him; or from 
everything that should not be imputed to Him: 
(L:) [I declare, or celebrate, or extol, his absolute 
perfection or glory or purity: or extolled be 
his absolute perfection &c.:] or I declare the 
remoteness of God, or his freedom (»4>), from 
evil, (Zj, * S, K, TA,) or from every evil; (TA;) and 
[especially] from the imputation of his having a 
female companion, and offspring: (K:) or I 
declare God's being very far removed from all the 
foul imputations of those who assert a plurality of 
gods: (MF:) [it sometimes implies wonder, and 
may well be rendered how far is God from every 
imperfection! &c.:] in this case, 44=*= is a 
determinate noun; (K;) i. e., a generic proper 
name, for =y4-4l, like as »> is for j4k (MF:) Zj 
says, (TA,) it is put in the accus. case in the 
manner of an inf. n.; (S, K;) i. e., as the absolute 
complement of a verb understood; the phrase 
with the verb supplied being 41=44 411 (MF;) 

meaning »4> ?j4ll 4? 411 (S, K, MF;) 44*== 

thus supplying the place of the verb: accord, to 
Ibn-El-Hajib and others, when it is prefixed 
to another noun or pronoun, governing it in the 
gen. case, it is a quasi-inf. n.; and when not so 
prefixed, it is a proper name, imperfectly deck: 
but to this it is objected that a proper name may 
be thus prefixed for the purpose of distinction, as 
in the instances of 4=4 f='4- and 0= jl j4l 4 j: some 
say that it is an inf. n. of an obsolete verb; 
but this assertion is not to be regarded; for, as an 
inf. n., its verb is <4*=, like 14*i of which the inf. n. 
is 4 i 144=: others say that it may be an inf. n. 
of =4=, though far from being agreeable with 
analogy: and some derive it from =4411 as 
signifying “ the act of swimming,” or “ the being 
quick, or swift,” or “ the being, or becoming, 
remote,” &c.: (MF:) [hence F adds,] or the phrase 
above-mentioned denotes quickness in betaking 
oneself to God, and agility in serving, or obeying, 
Him; [and therefore may be rendered I betake 



[BOOK I.] 

myself quickly to the service of God, and am 
prompt in obeying Him;] (K;) so accord, to ISh, 
to whom a man presented himself in a dream, 
and indicated this explanation of the phrase, 
deriving it from iO™ [“ the horse ran 
stretching forth his fore legs, as one does with his 
arms in swimming ”]. (L.) uj4j de 41 jUili 
ii jkuUl O&j, [in which is used in the place 
of the inf. n. of 4-, and 1 is understood 
before it,] in the Kur [xxx. 16 ], means Therefore 
perform ye prayer to God [or declare ye the 
remoteness of God from every imperfection &c.] 
when ye enter upon the time of evening and 
when ye enter upon the time of daybreak. (Fr, 
TA.) And 4c. 41 in the Kur xxiii. 93 , 

means Far [or how far] is God from that by which 
they describe Him! (Jel.) One says also, 414- 
meaning 4'i I a . 

44- [i. e. I glorify Thee by enumerating all thy 
benefits, and by the praising of Thee I 

glorify Thee]. (Mgh. [See also the prep, y.]) 

IjS (j* ijlkjB, (Msb, K,) or <B u^=4“, (S,) 

and ijBa J^P-, (A,) are (tropical:) 

phrases expressive of wonder (S, A, Msb, K) at a 
thing (S, Msb, K) and a person; (A;) originating 
from God's being glorified (kill 4*-- jl) at the 
sight of what is wonderful of his works, and 
afterwards, by reason of its being frequently said, 
employed in relation to anything at which 
one wonders; (Er-Radee, TA;) meaning (assumed 
tropical:) [I wonder greatly (lit., with wondering) 
at such a thing and such a person; as is shown 
by what follows; or] how extraordinary, or 
strange, is such a thing [and such a person!]. 
(Msb.) El-Aasha says, ij44 ,4*4 UJ Jjsi

greatly at' Alkameh the boasting]; i. e. 4> -4*11, 
(S,) or [rather] <1 4c. [for <i -44], lit. I 
wonder with wondering at him; (Msb;) [or how 
extraordinary a person is 'Alkameh the boasting 
!:] being without tenween because it is 

regarded by them as a determinate noun, and 
having a resemblance to a fern, noun: (S:) 
[though in what quality it resembles a fern, noun, 
except in its being of one of the measures of 
broken pis., I do not know:] or it is imperfectly 
decl. because it is a determinate noun, being a 
proper name for «ljB (IJ, IB) and (IJJ 

and because of the addition of the I and u: (IJ, 
IB:) this is the true reason: but some hold that it 
is rendered determinate by its being prefixed to a 
noun understood, governing it in the gen. case; 
the complete phrase being 44 j* <111 o'-=4“. 
(MF.) — — 144, thus with tenween, as an 

indeterminate noun, occurs in the phrase p 444 


144, in a poem of Umeiyeh. (IB.) — u'-=44 is also 
used in the sense of ,_>4, in the saying 4-1 4

analogy, but the former the more common, (Th,

(T, S, A, Msb, * K,) because He is an object 
of £-4-, (K,) and [often] immediately followed 
by o-jB, (A, Msb, K,) which is likewise also 
pronounced o- jB, though the former 
pronunciation is the more common: (Th, T, S, 
Msb: *) it signifies [All-perfect, all-pure, or all- 
glorious; i. e.] far removed, or free, from 
everything evil, (Zj, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and from 
every imperfection [and the like]. (Msb. [See 2 ,

(S) that there is no word like the two epithets 
above, of the measure J with damm as well as

principal, or only, rhyme-letter]: (Jm, K:*) or it 
consists in the agreement of the endings of words

agreement of the rhymes (Pp) [of verses]: (Mbr, 
in the “ Kamil; ” TA:) each clause ends with a 
quiescent letter; and consists of at least two 
words: (Kull p. 208:) [see an ex. in the first

properly a measure of a pi. of paucity]. 

P jPI is That [rhyming prose] in which the two 
words [that end two corresponding clauses] agree 
in the letter of the jP but not in measure; 
as pjll and pVI; and csjljP jpll i$ that in

T.) It is said in a trad., that Mohammad 
forbade jP in prayer: [but many of the forms of 
prayer which he himself prescribed, and many 
others commonly used by Muslims in every age 
to the present time, are jP, and the Kur-an is a 
composition of the same kind, though some do 
not allow this term to he applied to it, 
because jP is a highly artificial style of prose- 
language, characterized by a kind of rhythm as 
well as rhyme, and it is obviously not proper to 
ascribe such artificial language to God, nor is it 
proper to use it in prayer, wherefore] Az says 
that jP is disapproved in prayer because it 
resembles the language of the diviners, 
or soothsayers, but that other kinds of rhyming 
styles are allowable in and JPj. (TA.) He is

is a mistake, and that this phrase is only said of a

makes what is false to appear in the form of

truth, and causes a thing to be imagined different 
from what it really is, it is as though he turned it 
from its proper manner of being: (T, TA:) 
the producing what is false in the form of truth: 
(IF, Msb:) or, in the common conventional 
language of the law, any event of which the cause 
is hidden, and which is imagined to be different 
from what it really is: and embellishment by 
falsification, and deceit: (Fakhred-Deen, Msb:) 
or a performance in which one allies himself to 
the devil, and which is effected by his aid: (TA:) i. 
q. siil [meaning a kind of enchantment, 
or fascination, which captivates the eye and the 
like, and by which enchantresses withhold their 
husbands from other women]: (S:) and anything 
of which the way of proceeding or operation 
(likli) is subtile: (S, K:) accord, to Ibn-Abee- 
'Aisheh, A-“ is thus called by the Arabs because it 
changes health, or soundness, to disease: (Sh:) 
[and in like manner it is said to change hatred to 

love: (see l:)] pi. J-A and jjA (TA.) Also 

(tropical:) Skilful eloquence: (TA:) or 

used absolutely, it is applied to that for which the 
agent is blamed: and when restricted, to that 
which is praiseworthy. (Msb.) Thus it is in 
the saying of Mohammad, IAA uA u? u] 
(tropical:) [Verily there is a kind of eloquence 
that is enchantment]: because the speaker 
propounds an obscure matter, and discloses its 
true meaning by the beauty of his eloquence, 
inclining the hearts [of his hearers] in like 
manner as they are inclined by A*": or because 
there is in eloquence a novelty and strangeness of 
composition which attracts the hearer and brings 
him to such a pass as almost diverts him from 
other things; therefore it is likened to A“" 
properly so called: and it is said to be a All jAll 
[or lawful enchantment]. (Msb.) The saying of 
Mohammad mentioned above was uttered on the 
following occasion: Keys Ibn-’Asim El-Minkaree 
and EzZibrikan Ibn-Bedr and 'Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam 
came to the Prophet, who asked 'Amr respecting 
EzZibrikan; whereupon he spoke well of him: but 
Ez-Zibrikan was not content with this, and said, “ 
By God, O apostle of God, he knows that I am 
more excellent than he has said; but he envies the 
place that I have in thine estimation: ” and 
thereupon 'Amr spoke ill of him; and then said, 
“By God, I did not lie of him in the first saying 
nor in the other; but he pleased me, and I spoke 
as pleased; then he angered me, and I spoke as 
angered: ” then Mohammad uttered the above- 
mentioned words. (TA.) Their meaning is, but 
God knows best, he praises the man, speaking 
truth respecting him, so as to turn the hearts of 
the hearers to him, (K,) or to what he says; (TA;) 


and he dispraises him, speaking truth respecting 
him, so as to turn their hearts also to him, (K,) or 
to what he says after. (TA.) A' Obeyd says nearly 
the same. Or, as some say, the meaning is, that 
there is an eloquence that is sinful like Af. (TA.) 

Also (tropical:) Skill; science: Mohammad 

said, A • 'i - A ill UU A 1 

(tropical:) [He who learneth a process of the 
science of the stars (meaning astrology or 
astronomy) learneth a process of enchantment], 
which may mean that the science of the stars is 
forbidden to be learned, like the science of 
enchantment, and that the learning of it is an act 
of infidelity: or it may mean that it is skill, and 
science; referring to what is acquired thereof by 
way of calculation; as the knowledge of eclipses 

of the sun or moon, and the like. (ISd, TA.) 

Also (tropical:) Food; aliment; nutriment: so 

called because its effect is subtile. (TA.) ‘-A 

A“ A means (assumed 

tropical:) Superabundant rain. (TA.) A-* 1 : 
see AA in two places. — Also, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, 
K, &c.,) and J, A“, (TA,) and [ AA (Msb,) and

the pi. of A“ (Msb) and of J, A“ (TA) and of

departure of the night and the coming of the day; 
so that it is the A" [lit. the “ time of 
the breathing,” by which is meant the “ shining 
forth,”] of the dawn: (A:) there are two times of 
which each is thus called; one, which 
is [specially] called AA [or the 

earlier As] (A, Mgh,) is before daybreak; 
(Mgh;) or a little before daybreak: (A:) and the 
other, at daybreak: (A, Mgh:) like as one says “ 
the false dawn ” and “ the true: ” (A:) the 
earlier A* 1 is also called [ »A^: (S, K:) or 
the A is the same as the A-”: or it is the last 
third of the night, to daybreak. (TA.) Using A* 
indeterminately, you make it perfectly deck, and 
say, AA A 1 [I came to him a little before 
daybreak], agreeably with the phrase in the Kur 
liv. 34; (S;) and in like manner, J. sA*s [in the 
earlier AA (S, K:) you also say I AA and J, »A*s

'Ajjaj, is erroneous: (TA:) and is A* A# ! AA A

daybreak of this last night]. (TA.) When, by A* 
alone, you mean the A* of the night 
immediately preceding, you say, A k A*" AA [I 
met him a little before daybreak this last night, O 
thou man], (S, K,) making it imperfectly deck 
because it is altered from AA (S,) or because it 
is for AA; (TA;) and it is thus determinate by 
itself, (S, K,) without its being prefixed to another 
noun and without J: (S:) and in the same sense 
you say AA (TA:) and you say, AA A- Jr 1 
A ^ [Go thou on thy horse a little before 
daybreak this night, O youth: so in the TA; but in 
two copies of the S, for A I find A]: you do not 
make it to terminate with damm, [like A and A 
&c.,] because it is an adv. n. which, in a place 
where it is fitting to be such, may not be used 
otherwise than as such: (S:) and [in like manner] 
you say, J, lA U sA^ ‘A [I met him in 
the earlier A" of this last night, O thou man]. 
(TA.) If you make A the proper name of a man, 
it is perfectly deck: and so is the dim.; for it is not 
of the measure of a noun made to deviate from its 
original from, like A: you say, J, A A 
1 A“ [Go thou on thy horse a very little before 
daybreak: so in the TA; but here again, in two 
copies of the S, for A I find A]: you do not 
make it to terminate with damm, [like A &c.,] 
because its being made of the dim. form does not 
bring it into the class of adv. ns. which may also 
be used as nouns absolutely, though it does bring 
it into the class of nouns which are perfectly 
declinable. (S, TA.) — — A“ also signifies 
(tropical:) Whiteness overspreading blackness;

used in relation to the time so called, of

meaning He (Mohammad) used to talk to him 
(’Omar) in a low voice, like him who is telling a 

secret. (TA.) jl jUl is The selling in which 

one says, “I will put forth my hand and thou shalt 
put forth thy hand, and if I produce my signet- 
ring before thee, it is a sale for such a price; and if 
thou produce thy signet-ring before me, for such 
a price: ” if they produce together, or do not both 
produce, they do thus again. (Mgh.) 4 0“', (S, M, 


A, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. (Msb;) [and

secret; (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) namely, a story, 
or the like: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and, contr., he 
manifested it; revealed it; published it; made it 
known. (S, M, Msb, K.) Both of 
these significations have been assigned to the 
verb in the phrase I jjk\j, in the Kur [x. 55 

and xxxiv. 32]: (S:) some say, that the meaning is 
They will manifest repentance: Th says, they will 
conceal it from their chiefs: the former [says ISd] 
is the more correct: (M:) the former meaning is 
also given on the authority of AO; but Sh says, I 
have not heard it on the authority of any other; 
and Az says that the lexicologists most strongly 
disapprove of the saying of AO; and it is said that 
the meaning is, they, the chiefs of the polytheists, 
will conceal repentance from the lower class of 
their people, whom they shall have caused to err; 
and in like manner say Zj and the 
[other] expositors. (TA.) In like manner also the 
two contr. significations are assigned to the verb 
in the saying of Imra-el- Keys, [in 

his Mo'allakah,] ujjyy jl, which As used to 
quote with us thus, J*** u/jk jl, meaning that 
they might publish, or make known, 
my slaughter. (S.) You say also, 4JJ 14“' He

the news of the Prophet by reason of the love that 
is between you and them; the objective 
complement of the verb being suppressed: 
or ij*ll may be an objective complement, the m 
being a redundant corroborative, as in 3A' 

and <i (Msb:) and this interpretation is 
correct; for jljl*] to a person necessarily 
implies revealing a secret to him and at the same 

time concealing it from another. (B.) » j! 4“' j

enunciative denoting wonder: [see lA 4:] and 
hence the saying, (K,) ^ U jit How 

quick was thy doing that! (S, K.) The 

saying 3“ originated from the fact that 

a man had a lean ewe, her snivel running from 
her nostrils by reason of her leanness, and it 
being said to him “ What is this? ” he answered, 
“Her grease: ” whereupon the asker said as 
above: the last word is in the accus. case as a 
denotative of state; and the meaning is, Quick, or 
how quick, is this snivel [coming forth] in the 
state of melted grease! or the last word is a 
specificative, under the supposition that the 
action is transferred [from its proper agent, 
which thus becomes a specificative], as in the 
phrase 3 and the meaning to be 

understood is, Quick, or how quick, is the melted 
grease of this! the saying is applied to him who 
tells of a thing's coming to pass before its time: 
(O, K:) it is a prov. (TA.) — u^3" 1 ; and its

a fem. noun; (M;) or the inf. n. is Isy, and 
and Sj y are more special [in meaning, as will be 
shown below, voce *i‘y], and ijy is pi. of *i‘y; 
(Msb;) or *iy is an inf. n. un., and < iy is 
a simple subst., and so is ijy, (S, TA,) and so 
is tyy (Msb, TA) also, as some say; (TA;) He 
journeyed, or travelled, by night, or in the night, 
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) in a general sense; (M, K;) 
accord, to AZ, in the first part part of the night, 
and in the middle thereof, and in the last part 
thereof; (Msb, TA;) and \ [tjy\ signifies the same 
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) in the dial, of El-Hijaz, (S, 
Msb,) inf. n. »[>*]; (M;) as also J, LSy^; (M, K;) 
and perhaps J, fy likewise. (Mgh.) [See 
also lS j and y below.] It is said in a prov., 
yj l [They went away in the manner of a 
hedge-hog's night-travelling; meaning they 
went away by night]; because the goes all the 
night, not sleeping. (M.) — — [Hence, as 
denoting unseen progress,] it is said also of 
the root of a tree, meaning It crept along beneath 
the ground; (Az, M, K;) aor. as above, (M,) inf. 

n. Is y. (TA.) And it is said of ideal things, 

as being likened to corporeal things; tropically, 
and by extension of the signification; (Msb, TA;) 
or metaphorically; [as, for instance,] of 
calamities, and wars, and anxieties: (M, TA:) and 
the predominant inf. ns. [in these cases] are tyy 
and u^y. (TA.) One says, t*| ? tjy 
(tropical:) [The root, or strain, of evil crept 
in the man]. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb, TA.) And ijy 
(tropical:) [The poison crept in him, or 
pervaded him]; and similarly one says of wine; 
and of the like of these two things. (El-Farabee, 
Msb, TA. [See also m-.]) And the lawyers 
say, (tropical:) [The wound 

extended to the soul], meaning that the pain of 
the wound continued until death ensued in 
consequence thereof: (Mgh, * Msb, TA:) and 
ojicU. Jt is’ys, AiS (tropical:) [His hand was cut 
off, and it extended to his upper arm], meaning 
that the effect of the wound passed by 

transmission: and LSy, and jM, 

(tropical:) The prohibition, and the 

emancipation, [extended, or] passed 
by transmission: phrases current among the 
lawyers, but not mentioned in books of repute, 
though agreeable with others here preceding 
and following. (Msb, TA.) One says also, <jlc. ^y 
(tropical:) Anxiety came to him [or upon 
him] by night: and -P* ijy (tropical:) His 
anxiety went away. (Msb, TA.) And similar to 
these is the phrase in the Kur [lxxxix. 3], P JPj 
yk (tropical:) And by the night when it 
goes away: (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, when one 


journeys in it; like as one says fP lP meaning “ 
night in which one sleeps: ” the [final] j [of the 
verb] is elided because it terminates a verse. 
(TA.) — — It is made trans. by means of m: 
(Msb:) one says, jy [He made him 
to journey, or travel, or he transported him, by 
night, or in the night; or it may be rendered he 
journeyed, or travelled, with him, by night, or 
in the night]; (M, Msb, K;) and in like manner, 
[and more commonly,] jy\ J, (S, M, Msb, K;) 
and [ (S, M, K;) like as one says, iki 

as well as ii. 1 . (S.) As to the saying in the 

Kur [xvii. 1], 1 jyl J, j'^ 0 '-=P j [Extolled 

be the glory of Him who transported his servant 
by night!], it is an instance of corroboration, (S, 
K, * TA,) like the saying, OP cP and P jUll 
IP: (S, TA:) or the meaning is [simply] » 0 P: (K, 
TA:) accord, to 'Alam-ed-Deen Es-Sakhawee, ip 
is added, although jLYI is not otherwise than by 
night, because the space over which he was 
transported is not to be traversed in less than 
forty days, but was traversed by him in one night; 
as though the meaning [intended] were, cljl P 
7^-0; and it denotes wonder: Pi is here used 
instead of because when they say jy 
the meaning generally is he occupied the whole of 
the night in journeying: Er-Raghib holds the verb 
in this instance to be from IP signifying “ a wide 
tract of land,” to belong to art. jj*«, and to be 
like JP and pi; the meaning being, who 
transported his servant over a wide tract of land: 
but this is strange. (TA.) — PP l s'y, (M, K,) 
aor. j yk, (M, TA,) inf. n. Isy, (TA,) He threw 
his goods, or utensils and furniture, upon the 
back of his beast. (M, K.) — — And j'y 
pjP (pc., inf. n. Isy, He removed from over me 
the garment: but j is more approved [as the final 
radical: see 1 in art, jjp. (M, TA.) You say, PP 
and l *^y I pulled off the garment: and P- 
isy | It was removed from over him, and 
removed from its place: the teshdeed 

denotes intensiveness. (TA.) 2 j'y, (K,) or jj ^ 
*iy, (TA,) inf. n. yi, He (the leader of an 
army, TA) detached a ^y [q. v.] (K, TA) to the

art.,] meaning A journeying, or travelling, by 


night, or in the night, in a general sense, is masc.

be] jy: (Msb:) or one says, j *^y Wy [We

the subst. [signifying a journeying, or travelling, 
by night, or in the night,] is f and ijy. (S,

latter word by the substitution of ls for j because 
of the kesreh: (M, TA:) accord, to the K, J,

himself in mean, or light, estimation; (MA, and 
Ksh and Bd in ii. 124 ;) and rendered himself 
low, base, or contemptible: (Bd ibid.:) but Lh 
says that with kesr [to the «— •], inf. n. 3i^

otherwise than with kesr [to the «— •], because

the verb mentioned in the K require 
consideration: (TA:) accord, to Fr, when [the 
dependence of] the verb in the phrase AAO 
became transferred from the to the possessor 
thereof, what followed the verb became an 
explicative, to indicate that the [or 

lightwittedness, &c.,] was therein; and by rule it 
should be d j) j for the explicative should 

not be otherwise than indeterminate; but it was 
left in its state of a prefixed noun, and put in the 
accus. case in the manner of an indeterminate 
noun as being likened thereto; [the meaning, 
therefore, accord, to him, is he was, or became, 
lightwitted, &c., as to his mind;] it is not 
allowable, however, in his opinion, to make this 
accus. to precede [the verb], because the 
explicative may not precede; and similar to this is 
the phrase cVLy and f. cjjL, 

meaning jLiand^ es-dj (S, TA:)but 
this saying [of Fr] is disallowed by the 
grammarians; for they say that explicatives are 
indeterminate, and that determinate nouns may 
not be used as indeterminate: some of the 
grammarians say that 3-dj J in the Kur [ii. 

124 ] means ffLi VI [but he who 

is lightwitted, &c., in his mind], i. e., who 
becomes [the prep.] ^ being suppressed 
[and the noun therefore put in the accus.

the approvable saying is, that it means 6 * X!

with another upon credit: accord, to ISd, 
ignorant or [meaning under the age

asserts it to mean, because it is added, “or not 
able to dictate, himself: ” this, says Er-

TAb is related to have said that women are

not sufficient (L, K) for him (K) or for his family: 
(L:) or caused by poverty to have little power of 
motion; (L, K;) thus expl. by Aboo-Is-hak; but 
this is improbable; for u£-“ has the meaning of 
an active part, n., and his explanation [like one of 
the others mentioned above] makes it to have 
that of a pass. part, n.: (L:) Yoo says the like 
of ISk: (Msb:) he used to say that the u4— i$ in a 
harder condition than the j3a : (S, L, * Msb: *) he 
says, I asked an Arab of the desert, Art thou j3a? 
and he answered, No, by God, but rather u£-“; 
(S, L, * Msb;) but 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this 
man may have meant that he was low, or abject, 
by reason of his distance from his people and his 
home; and that he does not think he meant 
anything but that: (L:) [J also adds,] it is said in a 
trad, that the u4-“ is not he whom a mouthful or 
two mouthfuls will turn back, or away, but is only 
he who does not beg, and who is not known so 
that he may be given [anything]; (S;) but Ziyadet- 
Allah Ibn-Ahmad says that the is he who sits 
in his house, not begging, and the u£-“ is he who 
begs and is given; and hence it is argued that the 
latter is in a better condition than the former; 
though it indicates that the former is more 
highminded than the latter: (L:) accord, to As, 
the 04— “ is better in condition than the j3s; a nd 
this is [said to be] the right assertion, (Mgh, L, 
Msb,) for the pi. of the former is applied in the 
Kur xviii. 78 to men possessing a ship, or boat, 
which is worth a considerable sum; (L, Msb;) but 
they may have been thus termed because they 
were humbled and abased by the tyranny of the 
king who took every ship, or boat, that he found 
upon the sea, by force; (L;) and it is said that 
these men were hirers, not owners, of the vessel: 
(TA voce q. v.:) 'Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, that 
the is better in condition than the j3s is 

shown by a passage in the Kur [ix. 60], where it is 
said that the poor-rates are for the and 
the for you will find the classes to be there 

mentioned in such an order that the second is 
better in condition than the first, and the third 
than the second, and in like manner the fourth 
and the fifth and the sixth and the seventh and 
the eighth: and he says that the same is shown by 
the fact that the Arabs sometimes used u4—“ as a 
proper name, but not (L:) or when these two 
words are used together, they differ in 
signification; and when used separately, they 
[sometimes] signify the same: (El-Bedr El-

it: A’Obeyd says, I asked respecting it, and was 
told, it is not the fibrous substance of the Theban 
palm-tree, but is a kind of tree well known in El- 
Yemen, of which ropes are made: and some 
say that it is the 4“ [or leaves] of the 4-4 [or 
panic grass]: and this [says SM] is what is 
commonly known among us in El-Yemen: (TA:)

that the words which I have supplied are 
necessary to explain the true meaning. That such 
is the case, appears from what here follows.]) It is 
said in the L that 40 signifies The griping, 
with the hand, a thing that is contaminated by 
dirt, or filth, so that what is in it comes forth; and 
thus is done with a gut. (TA.) It is also said to

he scraped off the skin of the 3-4 with the knife so 
that he made its blood to appear. (M. [The

different explanations in the M, being

this meaning, is tropical.]) You say, <4 4k« ; (s,

one who is not a king; (TA;) also written o'-44; 
(M, Msb, K;) which is the only instance of this 
form: (Msb:) it is masc. and fem.; (M, TA;) 
generally masc., in the opinion of the skilful; but 
sometimes fem.; so say IAmb and Zj and others: 
(Msb:) but ISk says that it is fem. (TA.) One says, 
(ISk,) or some say, (Msb,) j'44l <j 44 (isk,

him contempt. (Mgh.) — — Strength, 

or hardness, of anything: (M, K:) sharpness of

The vehemence of winter. (TK.) An excited and 
predominant state of the blood; or inflammation 
thereof. (IDrd, M, K.) The flaming, or blazing, of 
fire. (IDrd.) — — A proof; an evidence; an 
argument; a plea; an allegation; syn. <4. (s, M, 
Mgh, Msb, K,) and c3 Jr. (S, Msb:) a <=4 being 


thus called because of the force with which truth 
attacks the mind: (B:) or, accord, to Mohammad 
Ibn-Yezeed, from 44, (M, TA,) signifying “ oil of 
olives,” because it enlightens: (TA:) and in these 
senses it has no pi., because it is used in the place 
of an inf. n. (S, TA.) Accord, to I'Ab, it 
signifies <4 wherever it occurs in the Kur. (TA.) 
But in the words of the Kur [xvii. 35], <3jl 44. 4 
444, the meaning may be either [We have given 
to his executor, or heir,] authority, and power, or 
absolute authority and power, or the like; or a 
plea, or the like. (Mgh.) And again, in the 
Kur [lxix. 29], 4U4 ^4 4, the meaning may 
be My dominion, and my authority and power 
over men, has perished from me; or my plea. (Bd, 
B.) And sometimes it means A miracle; as in the 
words of the Kur [li. 38], J3 J 1 *3! 44 jl i) 
Q J3 [When we sent him to Pharaoh 

with a manifest miracle]. (TA.) Az says that it is 
sometimes masc. because it has a masc. form; 
and thus it is in the last of the instances 

above. (TA.) Also A ruler, or governor, or 

the like; a king; a sovereign; (S, K, TA;) a 
khaleefeh: (TA:) these are its most 

common applications [in the writings of post- 
classical times]: (TA:) thus applied because the 
person so called is made to predominate; to have, 
or exercise, superior power or force; to have 
dominion, or the like: or because he is one of the 
evidences of God: (Aboo-Bekr, TA:) or because he 
possesses proof or evidence [of his right]: or 
because by him pleas and rights are established: 
(TA:) or because he enlightens the earth, (Msb, * 
B,) and is of great usefulness; (B;) the word being 
derived from 44 [signifying “ olive-oil ”]: (Msb:) 
it is of the measure 0^: (S:) and when [thus] 
applied to a person, it is masc.: (Msb:) or it is 
masc. and fem.: (S, TA:) accord, to Mohammad 
Ibn-Yezeed, (TA,) fem. because it is [originally] 
pi. of 44 applied to “ oil; ” as though the 
kingdom shone by him; or because it has the 
signification of 44 and sometimes masc., 
because regarded as meaning a man; (K, TA;) or 
because regarded as a sing.: so says Mohammad 
Ibn-Yezeed; but Az observes that none beside 
him says this: Fr says that he who makes it masc. 
regards it as meaning 3=3; and he who makes it 
fem. regards it as meaning 44 (TA:) the pi. 
is 0 * 414 . (s, Msb.) It is also, itself, sometimes 
used as a pi.; as in the phrase 044*11 4, used by 
a poet, meaning 04=40 4 [The lord of kings]; i. 
e. the khaleefeh: [but this may be rendered the 
lord of sovereign power, &c.:] or, as some say, the 
latter word is here pi. of 44, like as 0*4 J is pi. 
of =4*3. (Msb.) <3144, and 444, or 414 ;

author of the K says that J has made a mistake in 
saying in the above-cited passage; that he 
should have said 4-4; but others had made this 
remark before the author of the K; and 'Abd-El- 
Kadir Ibn-'Omar El-Baghdadee says that the 
mistake is to be imputed to these, and not to J, 
who has only used a sing, in the sense of a pi., 
like as 3=4 is used in the Kur [liv. 45 ], for 34^5? I :

downy; it is a herb, or leguminous plant, which 
spreads itself upon the surface of the ground, like 
[the plant called] “=41l 54 j, having no root, and

explanation of this verb except one which will be

[Hence,] fjllull is also syn. with p44H, (s, K, TA,) 
as meaning The saluting, or greeting, one with a 
prayer for his safety, or security, or freedom, 
from evils of any kind in his religion and in his 
person; and the interpretation thereof is [the 
expressing a desire for] j-Uill; (Mbr, TA;) or the 


saluting, or greeting, one with a prayer for his 
life; or, by saying 4*4 plo [q. v . infra, 
voce pll]; gyn. <441. (TA.) You say, <*4- pi 
[meaning He so saluted, or greeted, him]. (M,

means <4o, i. e. He saved him; and should be 
rendered agreeably with this explanation in 
the phrase commonly used after the mention of

Khaleefeh; saying, 0±“>4I j*?l 4 44c. pto 
Salutation to thee, or peace be on thee, &c.,

which is pronounced after the last rek'ah of each 
of the prayers (i. e. after the sunneh prayers and

delivered the deposit [to him, or] to its owner: 
(Msb:) and J, 4>l4UI J) Upll pul (Mgh) signifies 
the same as <41 <*Iu [i. e. He delivered the 
garment, or piece of cloth, to the tailor]. (Har p. 

166 .) See also 4 , in two places. You say 

also, ja.4441 <u4 jjptfl pu The hired man gave

above; denoting an ideal delivering [or yielding of 
a thing to another person]. (Msb.) [Hence one 

says, IU 4l p^. He conceded that it was thus.]

giving [one's] approval (S, K, TA) unreservedly, 
(S,) to that which is ordained, or decreed, (S, K, 
TA,) by God; and the submitting to his 
commands; and the abstaining from offering 
opposition in the case in which it is not becoming 
[to do so]. (TA.) You say, <41 j4Y pu He assented

to it:] or he submitted to it; as also J, pul. (MA.) 
3 <*llu, (m, Msb,) inf. n. 4JUA (s, M, Msb)

peace or reconciled, with him; or he reconciled 
himself with him: [implying mutual concession, 
or a compromise:] (S, * M, Msb:) and 4*llu They 
made peace, or became at peace or reconciled, or 
they reconciled themselves, each with the 
other. (K.) 4 pul see 2 , in nine places. [The first of 
the meanings there assigned to this verb is, in my 
opinion, more than doubtful. In all its senses, it 
seems to be properly trans.: when it is used as an 
intrans. verb, an objective complement is app. 
understood. Thus,] pul is syn. with *-414 [ a s 
meaning He paid in advance, or beforehand]; (S, 
M, Mgh, Msb;) 0*41 [the price] being suppressed, 
though sometimes it is expressed; (Mgh;) as also 
l pu; (M;) and J. pul, as occurring in a trad., 
where it is said, ?j*4 iP] 4 glp 5U j p^i 
[Whoso pays in advance for a thing, he shall not 
turn it over, or transfer it, to another than him]; 
but Kt says that he had not heard this verb thus 
used except in this instance. (TA.) So the first of 
these verbs signifies in the saying, pill ul pul 
(S) or j4l eP (Mgh) [He paid in advance for the 
wheat], and [for the thing], as also J, pu. 

(M.) And hence the saying, jl 41 j li ^ p!4 14 
Ph P jpu IjLi [if he give in advance wool for 
felt, or goats' hair for a garment, or piece, 
of haircloth, it will not be allowable]. (Mgh.) And 
so in the phrase, <41 Ci4l4 [1 paid in advance to 
him]. (Msb.) — — Also [He resigned, 

or submitted, himself; <Ul being understood: or] 
he was, or became, resigned, or submissive; (M, 
K;) and so J, pulul : (s, M, Msb, K:) you say, <4 pul 
[He resigned, or submitted, himself, or he was, or

an ex. (before referred to) in the last sentence of 
the second paragraph: or he was, or became, 
sincere in his religion, or without hypocrisy, 
towards God: see P~4>]: (Msb:) [or] pul signifies 
he entered into pull, (S, Msb,) which here 
means pilULYI [i. e. the state of resignation, or 

submission]. (S.) And He became a Muslim; 

as also [ pU; (M, * K;) as in the saying, p I jalS jtS

(M:) or he entered [the pale, or communion, of] 
the religion of p^LYI. (S, * Msb.) p&LYI as

humility or submission, and outward conforming 
with the law of God, and the taking upon oneself 
to do or to say as the Prophet has done or said: 
for this, the blood is to be spared, and one may 
demand the repelling of evil: (T, * M:) and if 
there is therewith firm belief with the heart, it 
is uAjj: (T:) this is the doctrine of Esh-Shafi’ee; 
but the doctrine of Aboo-Haneefeh makes no 
difference between these two terms: (KT:) 
[agreeably with the former doctrine,] Th well and 
briefly says, pAtfl is with the tongue, and uApH is 
with the heart: and he says, in explaining 
verse 48 of ch. v. of the Kur, that every prophet 
has been sent with pAtfl, though the ordinances 
differ. (M.) — — One says also, c uAl 
Ap meaning I left it [app. an affair, as in an 
explanation in the TK,] after I had been 
[engaged] in it. (Ibn-Buzuq, K.) And 
occurs intransitively in the saying, p p£ ,^1 j jA 
pP meaning [He was a pastor of sheep, or goats; 
then] he left them. (M.) — — [Freytag assigns 
to ffol another signification “ Adscendere fecit 
(vid. a pO,” as from the Ham, p. 39: but this is 
app. a mistake, into which he has been led by a 
saying, there cited, of Zuheyr, which I read 
thus: iiijll P-PA /ill Is / (meaning. The descent, 
or as the descent, of the bucket that the well-rope 
has let go): and by its being there said that “ you 
should not prefer any reading of to that with 
damm, though it has been said otherwise: ” 
whereas the correct reading is, in 
my opinion, Is /, agreeably with what here 
follows:] Er-Riyashee says, on the authority of 
AZ, that ls/I, with fet-h, is downwards; and 
with damm, upwards; and he cites the saying 
above as an ex. of the word as meaning 
downwards. (TA in art. 1 jj*.) 5 A* pi He

tropical:) they kept pace, one with another;

of PPP 1 is [said to be] The wiping, or stroking, 
the AA ; i. e. the stone: afterwards it was used in 
relation to other things, and one said AS

immunity, or freedom; as also 4 (Sb, M:) 

IKt says that these two words may be dial. vars. 
[syn. each with the other]; or the former may be 
pi. of the latter [or rather a coll. gen. n. of which 
the latter is the n. un.]: (M, TA:) and Suh says, in 
the R, that most of the lexicologists hold them to 
have one [and the same] meaning: but that if 
they considered the language of the Arabs, and

the distinction, or limitation, denoted by the », 
they would see that between them is a great 
difference [inasmuch as the former has a 
large range of meaning which the latter has not, 
as will be seen from what follows]. (TA.) pP pL« 
is an announcement of the continuance 
of [or safety, &c.]: (Bd in xiii. 24:) [it may 
therefore be rendered Safety, &c., be, or light and 
abide, on you; or, generally, peace be, or light and 
abide, on you; for] it means nothing disliked, or 
evil, shall befall you henceforth: (Bd in xvi. 34:) 
and PP [may be rendered in like manner; 
for it virtually] means I will not do to thee 
anything that is disliked, or evil; (Bd and Jel in 
xix. 48;) nor say to thee henceforward what 
would annoy thee, or be disagreeable, or evil, 
to thee. (Bd ibid.) It may also be [rendered May 
safety, &c., or peace, be, or light and abide, on 
you; as] a prayer for 5 -«lp to those to whom it is 
addressed, from the state in which they are at the 
time. (Bd in xxviii. 55.) [It is generally held that 
this salutation may not be used by, nor to, any 
but a Muslim.] In the beginning of an epistle, 
the approved practice is to write PP PP 
without the article J; and in repeating it, at the 
end, to write it with that article. (Durrat el- 
Ghowwas, in De Sacy's Anthol. Gramm. Arabe, p. 
72 of the Arabic text. [In the latter case, the 
general practice in the present day is to 
write simply pPJIj, suppressing PP.]) In 
saluting the dead, one puts PP first, saying, PP 
<111 pp (Ham p. 367.) You also say, 'Ps liS j\S, U 
•^“ip 1 l [No, by thy safety, such and such 
things were not]. (S.) is also a name of God, 
(S, M, Msb, K,) [applied to Him in the Kur lix. 23, 
accord, to some for piUl jj i. e. p] 

because of his safety, or freedom, from defect, 
and imperfection, and cessation of existence; 
(IKt, M, TA;) or from variations, and as being 
the everlasting, who brings the creation to 
nought and will not come to nought; or, accord, 
to Suh in the R, He is so named [as being the 
Author of Safety, Security, &c.; i. e.] because He 
has rendered all his creatures safe, or free, from 
defectiveness, or unsoundness, and mankind and 
the jinn, or genii, from the betiding of injustice, 
or wrong, to them, from Him; and the expositors 
who assert that He is thus named because of his 
safety, or freedom, from imperfections, and evils 
of any kind, utter an unseemly saying, 
making pP to be syn. with J, fP, which latter 
applies only to him who is liable to evil of any 
kind, and who expects it, and then becomes safe, 
or free, from it. (TA.) pCJI P is an appellation of 
Paradise, (M, K,) [applied thereto in the Kur vi. 
127 and x. 26,] as being the abode of everlasting 


safety, or security; (Zj, M, TA;) the abode of 
safety, or security, from evils of any kind, 
from death and decrepitude and diseases [&c.]: 

(TA:) or as being the abode of God. (M, TA.) 

See also fp in four places. — — [As is 
there stated,] it signifies also Salutation, or 
greeting; (M, TA;) particularly the salutation 
of plpl [by saying PP p-* or pP pp expl. 
above]; (Bd in iv. 96;) a subst. (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) 
from <P (Msb,) [i. e.] from fPP (S, Mgh, 

TA,) like from PP (Mgh. [See 2, third 

sentence.]) In the saying in the Kur [xxv. 

64], UiP I jin jjUUJI pjJaU. lijj [And when the 
ignorant speak to them, they say, IPp], this last 
word signifies iPp (Sb, M,) or lilus [for flP 
ULu We declare ourselves to be clear, or quit, 
of you], and P [f or AS jli; pS jlii W e 

relinquish you], (Bd,) [and means] there shall be 
neither good nor evil between us (Sb, M, Bd) 
and you: it is not the pP that is used in 
salutation; for the verse was revealed at Mekkeh, 
and the Muslims had not then been commanded 
to salute the believers in a plurality of gods: (Sb, 
M:) [in iv. 88 of the Kur, which was promulgated 
afterwards, at ElMedeeneh, is a 
general command to return a salutation with a 
better or with the same; but the Sunneh 
prescribes that the salutation of PP pP or pP 
PP when addressed to a Muslim by one not a 
Muslim is to be returned only by saying PPj 
or pP j:] or the meaning in xxv. 64 is, they say a 
right saying, in which they are secure from 
harming and sinning. (Bd.) Sb asserts that Aboo- 
Rabee'ah used to say, P>P P UMa pal Ip 
meaning PP [for PIP P* pal, i. e. When thou 
meetest such a one, say, I declare myself to be 
clear, or quit, of thee]: and he says that some 
of them said PP meaning The case of me and 
thee is the [case of] being clear, or quit, each of 
the other; and the [case of] mutual relinquishing. 
(M.) [It is usual, in the present day, to say, ilp 
ppp ip meaning Do thou such a thing, and 
there will be an end of altercation between us.] — 
See also fP. — Also A kind of trees; (S, M, Msb, 
K;) they assert that they are evergreen; nothing 
eats them; but the gazelles keep to them, and 
protect themselves by their shade, but do not 
hide among them; and they are not great trees, 
nor of the kind called (AHn, M:) they are 
also called J, PP (K;) or this is pi. of [n. un. 
of P-], which is of another kind; like as P] is pi. 
of PP (ib, TA:) n. un. with ». (S, M.) PP pPJI 
was said to an Arab of the desert; and he 
replied, PP P'PP': and being asked, “ What is 
this reply? ” he answered, “They are two bitter 
trees: thou hast put upon me one, so I have put 


upon thee the other. ” (K.) — See also P-, in two 
places. pp see fp in two places: — and 
the paragraph here next preceding, last sentence 
but two. fP i. q. I fp (S, M, K,) which means 
Safe, secure, or free, (Msb,) from evils of 
any kind; (K, Msb, TA;) applied to a man: (M:) 
pi. (UP; (m, K, TA;) in some copies of the K ^Pp 
like pi. of pp (TA;) [but this is probably 
its pi. only when it is used in the sense of jyp or 
the like, as seems to be the case from what 
follows.] Also, (M,) applied to a heart: (S, M:) P9 
jp, in the Kur xxvi. 89, means With a heart 
free from unbelief: (M, TA:) or, divested of 
corruptness, or unsoundness: (Er-Raghib, TA:) in 
the Kur xxxvii. 82, some say that it means with 
a grieving, or sorrowful, heart; from fP in the 
sense here next following. (Bd.) — — Also i. 
q. jP [meaning Bitten by a serpent]; (S, M, K;) as 
also J, pP (S, K) and [ fjP>: (K:) app., (S,) as 
implying a good omen, of safety; (S, M;) or 
because the person is left (PP to that [bane] 
which is in him: (IAar, S, * M:) and sometimes it 
is metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:) 
wounded: (M:) or it means wounded, at the point 
of death, (M, K,) as some say: (M:) pi. pP 
(M, and Ham p. 214.) — Also, (M, K,) of a horse, 
(M,) The part, of the hoof, that is between 
the jP [or hair, or extremity of the skin, 
next the hoof], (M, TA,) or that is between 
the P>i [q. v.], (K,) but the former is the right, 
(TA,) and the interior of the hoof. (M, K, 
TA.) AiP [the most usual inf. n. of p]: see PP 
in three places. — Also n. un. of pP“ applied to a 
kind of trees [described above]. (S, K.) Pp a 
noun of the fern, gender, (Msb,) A certain bone 
that is in the upa [q. v., here meaning foot] of 
the camel: (S, K:) this is said by A'Obeyd to be the 
primary signification: (S:) or the of the 

camel are the bones of the [or foot]: (M:) 
[for] cPP is used alike as sing, and pi., and 
sometimes it has also a pi., (S,) which 
is cjliilp (S, M, K:) or it is a pi. [or rather a coll, 
gen. n.], of which the sing, [or n. un.] is pip 
signifying the [q. v.] of [any of] the fingers: 
(IAth, TA:) [but this is a strange explanation:] it 
is said that the last parts in which p [here 
meaning marrow or pulp and the like] remains in 
a camel when he has become emaciated are 
the and eye; and when it has gone from 

these, he has none remaining: (S:) the pi. cppp 
(S, TA,) or pip (M, Msb,) also signifies the 
bones of the jpp (S, M,) so says Kh, and Zj adds 
that they are also called the Pp (Msb,) of the

an authority, of the verse of ’AbdAllah Ibn-’Omar

themselves, or wearying themselves, [during the

says that J has erred in saying that the meaning 
is, “having no fodder in their bellies: ” but this is 
the explanation of the words jjVI ■ — alii., as IM

by what follows:] AHn says, some assert that 
the 3*3* is such of the produce of herbs as 
resembles the produce of the jkil [q. v.] and 
the like; and such as the produce of the reed, or

the explanation fi 4144s 4U4 4 ! j4!i (.£ j£al 
34, in the Kur [ii. 261 ], means (assumed 
tropical:) [But look at thy food and thy 
beverage,] it has not become altered [for the 
worse] by the lapse of years: (Fr, S, TA:) Az says 
that this is the right way of reading, 
by pronouncing the » in 14 in pausing after it 
and in continuing without pausing: Ks used to 
suppress the » in the latter case and to 
pronounce it in the former: and Aboo-'Amr 
EshSheybanee says that the original 
form [of u4] is the like change being made 
in it as is made in 44 [for 44 ;] and in 443 
[fo r ,_ 5 jUiil 44s]. (TA. [See also 5 
in art. 4 “ and t 4 “, last sentence.]) 4 a word of 
which the final radical letter is rejected, (S, Msb,) 
and of which there are two dial, vars., (Msb,) 
being, accord, to some, originally 3-4, (S, Msb,) 
like 3$4 (S) or °4*, (Msb,) and accord to 
others, » 4“, (S, * Msb,) like » j4“, and upon each 
of these originals are founded modifications of 
the word, (Msb,) therefore it is mentioned in the 
K [and S and other lexicons] in the present art. 
and again in art. 4“, (TA,) A year; syn. 34“-; 
(Msb;) or 4: (M, K:) or, as Suh says, in the R, 
the 34 is longer than the 4; the latter word 
being applied to the [twelve] Arabian 
months [collectively], and thus differing from the 
former word: (TA:) with the Arabs it consists of 
four seasons, mentioned before [in art. i> j, 
voce o A 3 ]: but sometimes it is tropically applied 
to (tropical:) a single J4s [or quarter]; as in the 
saying, 4 34*11 4=41 ^Is, meaning [The rain 
continued] during the J4 [or quarter, all of it]: 
(Msb:) [see more in art. 4“ and c4“:] the dim. is 
l 3$4 (S, Msb) accord, to those who make the 
original of 31* to be 3$4, (Msb,) and J, 414 (s, 
Msb) accord, to those who make the original 
of 34 to be »4“; (Msb;) and some say 4114, but 
this is rare: (TA:) the pi. is 4j4 (Msb, K) accord, 
to those who make the original of 34 to be 4-4, 
(Msb,) and 44 -* (Msb, K) accord, to those who 
make the original of 44 to be “14“ ; (Msb;) 
and 04“ also, (S, Msb, K,) like the masc. perfect 
pi., (Msb,) [agreeably with a rule applying to 
other cases of this kind,] with kesr, to the ij=, (S, 
TA,) and 04“ [in the accus. and gen. cases], 
(Msb, TA,) so that one says, 04“ [These are 
years], and 04“ 4 lj [1 saw years], (TA,) 
and the 0 is elided when it is prefixed to another 
noun, governing the latter in the gen. case, 
(Msb,) and some say 04“, with damm to 
the i_>“; (S, TA;) and in one dial., the lS is retained 
in all the cases, and the 0 is made a letter of 
declinability, with tenween when the word 
is indeterminate, [so that one says 04“,] and is 


not elided when the word is prefixed to another 
noun, governing the latter in the gen. 
case, because it is [regarded as] one of the radical 
letters of the word; and of this dial, is the saying 
of the Prophet, 4* j* 044* 44 ( l^llc 14*41 ^41 [o 
God, make them to be to them years like the 
years of Joseph]; (Msb; [but in my copy of the 
Mgh, I find “4 “ jj ^4“^;]) or with respect to 04“, 
like 04“, with refa [and tenween], there are 
two opinions; one is, that it is of the 
measure u44, like 04^, with a rejection [of one 
letter], though this is an anomalous pi., for 
there sometimes occurs among pis. that which 
has no parallel, as <_s4, and this is the opinion of 
Akh; the other is, that it is of the 
measure 3=4, changed to 3=4 because of the 
kesreh of the second letter; the pi. being in some 
instances of the measure 3=*a, like 4=4 and 44 ; 
but he who holds this opinion makes its final u to 
be a substitute for j, and that of 31* a substitute 
for ls: (S:) you may also suppress the 

tenween in 44 “; [in which case it seems that one 
says 44 “ in the nom. case (assimilating it to 4 ) 4 “) 
as well as in the accus. and the gen.; like as one 
does in the instances of olw and oijj, pis. of »j=, 
accord, to the K, though, as I have shown in 
art. jjj, there is some doubt on this point;] but 
the suppression of the tenween in 44 “ is more 
rare than its pronunciation: (T Ak p. 18 :) and 
another pi. is 44 “, [originally 4 “,] of the 
measure 34-3 (Er-Raghib, TA in art. 4“.) The 
phrase 44“ 3=4 41=, in the Kur [xviii. 24 ], is said 
by Akh to be for 44^1 4 = 31*3= [Three hundred of 
years]: and he says that if the 4 ) 4 “ be an 
explicative of the <4*, it is in the gen. case [to 
agree with -4'“]; and if an explicative of the 41=, it 
is in the accus. case [to agree with 413]. (S. [See 
also Bd on this phrase; and see De Sacy's Ar. Gr., 
2 nd ed., i. 423 .]) [44, relating to an animal or a 
plant or the like, means To the completion of a 
year: and 4 _i, to the completion of his, or its, 
year; i. e. in his, or its, first year.] And one says, 
l 4 l 4 4 lLal [i met him some years ago; three 
or more, to ten, years ago]: a phrase like 4 ls =41 
e=41l. (Az, TA in art. fj*=.) And J, 44 is a dim. 
of enhancement, of 34 : one says "4“ A 

severe year of drought or barrenness or dearth: 
(TA:) and 4 l= 4 ll I jilj j 4=4 [They 

lapsed into the severe years of scantiness of

upon the people of ElMedeeneh. (K, TA.) — —

barrenness: (Msb, K, TA:) or vehement, or 
intense, drought: (TA in art. 4“0 an instance of a

applied to “ a horse,” and 34 applied to “ camels:

barrenness, befell it. (Msb.) And in like manner 
one says of people, 44-11 ^ . Tj l. 4 (tropical:)

herbage and of a place in which to alight was sent 
to a tract, and found it dried up by want of rain,

he said, 3411, meaning (tropical:) Drought, &c.

a trad., 34H=j*4 Jc. 4 ? 1 4®. i. e. (tropical:) [O

twelve revolutions of the moon: the ^

lunar year] is three hundred and fifty-four 
days and a third of a day: it is also said, on the 
authority of Er-Raghib, that ^ is used as 
denoting a year in which is difficulty, and 
drought, or barrenness, or dearth; and f'i, as 
denoting that in which is ampleness of the

of herbage or the like; and by this is explained the 
nice point in the words of the Kur [xxix. 13], ‘-ill

He experienced evil, or that which he disliked 
or hated, (S, * K, TA,) or displeasure, (TA,) or 
grief, or anxiety. (M, TA.) P »P! occurs in a trad, 
as meaning He (the Prophet) became displeased, 
or grieved, or anxious, on account of it; i. e., on 
account of a dream that had been related to him: 
or, accord, to one relation, the right reading 
is meaning “ he sought the interpretation 

of it, by consideration. ” (TA.) ip is an inf. n. 
of iP, (Lth, S, M, K,) intrans., (Lth, M,) and 
trans.: (S, M, K:) and is also used as an epithet, 
applied to a man, (M, Msb, and Ham p. 712,) and 
to an action. (Msb.) You say f P j (S, M, Msb, 
K) [A man of evil nature or doings; or] a man

and »P — i*— a bad commodity: (O and TA in 
art. 1 — and if you make the former 
word determinate [by means of the article Jl], 
you use the latter as an epithet [also], (M, * Msb,

evil man, or the man who does what is evil &c.]: 
(Msb, and Ham p. 712:) and «pll JPJI [the evil 
deed]: (Msb:) [this last phrase I hold to be 
correct, regarding ip" in this case as originally 
an inf. n. of the intrans. verb *P, and therefore 
capable of being used as an epithet applied to 
anything; though] IB says that jUl used as an 
epithet is applied to a man but not to a deed: 
(TA:) [in what here follows from the S, denying 
the correctness of another phrase mentioned 
above on the authority of lexicologists of high

mistranscription, twice occurring, «■ jUl for ipll,

copy of that work into most other copies thereof,

saying * jP 34 j and »P 34 j, with fet-h to the o- 
in both; but not « pll 34 j, with damm to the o“, 
because ip" is a subst., meaning “ harm, injury, 
hurt, mischief, or damage,” and “ evilness of state 
or condition; ” and 34 j is prefixed, as governing 
a gen. case, only to the inf. n.: and he adds that 
one says, »jP 34 P IP, not prefixing [the former 
noun to the latter, but using the latter as 
an epithet]. (TA.) — — See also the next

the Kur [xiii. 18, i. e. The evilness of the 
reckoning], is expl. by him as meaning a 
reckoning in which no good work will 
be accepted, and no evil work passed over;

of no avail: or, as some say, it means a 
reckoning pursued to the utmost extent, in which 
no evil work will be passed over. (M, TA.) jP V

water, and especially, or mostly, the dates of El- 
Medeeneh; and in like manner, Aboo-Bekr and 
'Omar together are called 44*4 and the sun and

it means water and milk; and is applied hy a rajiz

saying of 'Aisheh, that she was with the Prophet 
when they had no food, but only the 444 which 
is expl. by the lexicologists as meaning dates and

as being likened to the paining of a whip; (Msb;) 
because punishment is sometimes with the 1=3“; 
(S;) and this word is used by the Arabs to denote 
every kind of punishment when it is extreme, 
though there be in it no beating: (Fr:) [therefore,] 
the above-cited saying in the Kur means, 
(tropical:) [And thy Lord poured upon them a 
portion, or a share, or vehemence, or severity, 
of punishment: or it means,] a mixture; prepared 
for them, of various punishments: or it is 
designed to show that what befell them in 
the present world was, in comparison with what 
is prepared for them in the final state, like the 
whip in comparison with the sword: (Bd:) or 
the meaning is (assumed tropical:) a kind of 
punishment. (Jel.) [Agreeably with this last 
explanation, it is said that] the phrase 1=3 
3 U=3“ gl jWin means (tropical:) They two are 
agreed upon one mode: (A:) or the meaning is 
(tropical:) [they two enter, or plunge, into; or 
venture boldly upon, and do;] one thing, or affair; 
(S, and K; but wanting in one copy of the former; 
and in the latter, in the place of 1=* is put 1=;) i. e., 

one sort [of thing or affair]. (S.) [-1=3“ 3a 

The measure of a whip, i. e. a whip's length, is an 
astronomical measure, which seems, from 
several instances that I have noted, in the work 
of Kzw &c., to be the same as jy=j is in modern 
usage; i. e. four degrees and a half, by rule; but, 
like the latter, not precise nor uniform in every 
instance.] — — [The pi.] 1=11= also signifies 
(tropical:) The seed-stalks of leeks; (TK;) the 
stalks, of leeks, upon which are the j#-* 3 thereof: 
(M, K:) so called as being likened to the -11=“ 
with which one strikes. (M.) — — And -1=3“ 
signifies also (tropical:) A remaining portion (A, 
K) of water, (A,) or of a pool of water left by 
a torrent, (K, [in some copies of which J=3JI is 
erroneously put for j=3JI J) extended like the -1=3“

because it changes the aor. from the strait time, 
which is the present, to the ample time, which is 
the future; (Mughnee voce [q. v.];) i. e., 
denoting with respect to that which has not 
yet happened; (Sb, S, K;) and postponement; 
(M;) and is used in terrifying and threatening and 
promising; (IDrd, K;) or it is a word denoting 
promising or threatening: (Msb:) it is syn. 
with iy accord, to some, or has a larger meaning 
than this latter accord, to others. (Mughnee.) You 
say, J4I — [I will do such a thing]. (Sb, S.) And 
one may not introduce a separating word 
between it and its verb, [except in a case 
mentioned in what follows,] because it occupies 
the place of the 0 “ in [&c.]. (Sb, S.) [But] it 
is distinct from u» by its [sometimes] having J 
prefixed to it; as in [the phrase in the Kur xciii. 
5 ], j [And thy Lord will give 

thee, and thou wilt be well pleased]: (Mughnee:) 
in this phrase, [however,] the J is [considered as] 
pre- fixed to the verb, not to the particle: (M:) or 
the phrase is elliptical, for ciuV . (Bd.) 

And it is distinct from in this, that it is 
sometimes separated [from its verb] by a 
verb divested of government both as to the letter 
and the meaning; as in the saying, *-* j4j ij jil Uj 
iLuj jia*. 3 pjh lS J4.I [And I know not, but I 
shall, I think, know, whether the family of Hisn 
be a company of men or women]. (Mughnee.) —

dust, (S, M, K,) in order that he may know, (S, K,)

he says, (TA, [in which a similar explanation is 
cited from ISd also,]) they mention the 3

thereby. (K, TA.) Thus, the saying 3a 

jUu jc., (s, K, TA,) in the Kur [lxviii. 42 ], (S, TA,) 
[lit. On a day when a shank shall he uncovered,] 
means (assumed tropical:) on a day

says 33 ^ j 1 for the sake of the measure and 
rhyme, for see what is said, in the 

explanations of the preposition 44 respecting the

likening him to the chameleon, which places 
itself facing the sun, and ascends half-way up the 
tree, or shrub, then climbs to the branches when 
the sun becomes hot, then climbs to a

says in the S], (TA,) [though trans.,] He dropped, 
left out, omitted, or neglected, (S, M, K,) and did 
so through inadvertence, (S, K,) a thing, (S,) or a 
letter, or word, of the Kur-an, (M, K,) or a 
verse thereof: (M:) mentioned by A'Obeyd: (S:) 
and in like manner, accord, to IAth, in reckoning, 
and in shooting, or casting: and Hr says 
that ls 4, with 4, is allowable, as meaning -1=41. 
(TA.) — — Also He was, or became, affected 
with o4w [or leprosy, which is sometimes 
termed 4 1 ; so that the verb in this sense also 

seems to be originally 141]. (TA.) And He 

was, or became, restored to health, [or free 
from 4 as meaning an evil affection, (as though 
the verb were in this sense likewise 
originally 4', the incipient I being privative, as it 
is in many other instances, like the Greek 
privative a,)] after a disease, or malady. (TA.) —

6 Ujl4 They two were, or became, equal, like 
each other, or alike; as also J, '“4!. (M, K.) 
I lS 4 j has two and more agents assigned to 
it: one says, 4 4 44 jb4 j 4 j is 4! [Zeyd and 
'Amr and Khalid were equal, or alike, in this]; i. 
e. 1344 whence the saying in the Kur [ix. 19 ], 4 
uj4*j V J, 41 [They will not be equal, or alike, in 
the sight of God]. (TA.) And one says, 4 ljj4 
J-41 They were, or became, equal in respect of the 
property, none of them exceeding another; 
as also Ij4! | 4. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., as 
some relate it, [ 04* 4 “'-4 ls 4 4, in which 
the meaning is said to be i_s4‘“ [i. e. He whose 
two days are alike, neither being distinguished

with defect [and thus become alike, they perish]: 
or when they become equal in ignorance: or when 
they form themselves into parties and 
divisions, and every one is alone in his opinion, 
and they do not agree to acknowledge one 


exemplar or chief or leader [so that they are 
all alike]: or, accord, to Az, when they are alike in 
evil, there being none among them possessed of 
good. (TA.) 8 lS 4 1 [seems, accord, to Bd, 
to signify primarily He sought, or desired, what 
was equal, equable, uniform, even, or the like: for 
he says (in ii. 27) that the primary meaning 
of £144 is 44 1 4*4 app. indicating the sense 

in which 4 4 1 is here used by what follows. 

And hence, accord, to him, but I would rather say 
primarily, as being quasi-pass, of =4,] It was, or 
became, equal, equable, uniform, even, level, flat, 
plane or plain, [or equal in respect of elevation or 
of depression, (see 2, first sentence,)] straight, 
right, direct, or rightly directed; syn. J4 \ (S, M, 
Msb, K, TA, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 27) 4 4, 
(TA,) said of a place, (Msb,) and 4, said of a 
stick, or piece of wood, & c. (Ksh ubi supra.) And 
J, (_s4, [if not a mistranscription for 44,] inf. 
n. 44, signifies the same as <s 4 1 [app. meaning 
as above], accord, to LAar; and so does [ is 4b as 
also 44, formed from it by transposition. 
(TA.) One says, 44 4 d>4! [lit. The earth, or 
ground, became equable, uniform, even, &c., with 
him, he having been buried in it], meaning 
he perished in the earth; as also J, 4, and J, 44

[even in its surface, being] affected with drought,

uneven, became straight, or even]: (Mgh:)

means It stood up or erect: and was, or became, 
even, or straight: hence one says, 4 is 4 1 
44 He, or it, went towards him, or it, 

with an undeviating, a direct, or a straight, 
course, like the arrow hot forth: and 

hence, 4! <_s4 1 ’ 1 p is metaphorically said of

Zeyd]; Li being redundant: and -4j 44 V also; 
like as one says, -43 A (M, K:) [J says,] with 
respect to the case of the noun following 4 there 
are two ways: you may make Li to he in the place 
of l 4, and mean that an inchoative is to be 
understood, [namely, j* or the like,] and put the 
noun that you mention in the nom. case as the 
enunciative; thus you may say, 44 V 44

of him who is thy brother; or above all, or 
especially, he who is thy brother]: (S, TA: [thus in 
a copy of the S: in other copies of the same, and 
in the TA, for Li4 ,4“:]) but this rendering is 
invalidated in such a phrase as -43 44 V j by the 
supression of the correlative of the noun in 
the nom. case where there is no lengthiness, and 


hy the applying to denote a rational being: 
(Mughnee:) or you may put the noun after it 
in the gen. case, making redundant, and 
making 4 " to govern the noun in that case 
because the meaning of 4 " is J": [and this is the 
preferable way:] (Mughnee:) in both of these 
ways is recited the saying of Imra-el-Keys, 4j VI 
J>1> Sjli o L^4 V 3 4 1 — ^ 04° 411 jajj [Verily

meaning is, 414 jk 41 4 Vj [and there shall

saying 1^4 34 u! Li4 Vj f44 4a j], accord, to 
Akh, L* is a substitute for the affixed pronoun »,

explaining that in 44 may be redundant, and 
the noun after it governed in the gen. case as the 
complement of a prefixed noun; and that may 
be used in the sense of l 4, and the noun 
following put in the nom. case as the enunciative 
of the inchoative j* which is suppressed;] that, 
accord, to some, the noun following may he in 
the accus. case, as being preceded by an 
exceptive; [or, as a specificative; (Mughnee;) in 
which case we must regard as a substitute for 
the affixed pronoun »;] but that this is not a good 
way; [and in this case, accord, to the generality of 
the authorities, it must he an indeterminate 
noun, not, like -43, determinate: (Mughnee:)] also 
that 44 should not be used without V preceding 
it: and that it denotes the predominance of what 
follows it over what precedes it: but it is 
added that V is sometimes suppressed [as is said 
in the Mughnee] because known to he meant, 
though this is rare. (TA.) One says also, Lil 44

one: (TA:) and Li 4 V (Lh, M, K) i. e. Such a 
one is not the like of thee. (TA.) [In both of these 
instances, L* is obviously redundant. Other 
(similar) usages of 4 ^ are mentioned voce 314, 

to which reference has been made above.] 

4" also signifies A [desert such as is 
termed] » jL33 ; (s, M, K) because of the evenness 
of its routes, and its uniformity. (TA.)

or midway, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) between us and thee, 
(Ksh, Bd,) or to the comer from each of the two 
extremities: (Jel:) or isy and ij'y 

means [i. e. a place marked], (so in a copy of 
the M and in one of the K,) or (so in other 
copies of the K and in the TA,) which is for 
meaning having a mark, or sign, by which one is 

guided, or directed, thereto. (MF, TA.) [Also 

Equal, or alike, in any respect.] One says, ^ jj*

Akh says, 3ijL is of the measure and 4“ may 
be of the measure or 31s, the former of which is 
the more agreeable with analogy, the j being 
changed into ls in y because of the kesreh 
before it, for it is originally 44“; and it is 
from meaning “ I neglected the thing: 

” [see 4:] (S:) accord, to Aboo-'Alee, the ls 
in is changed from the j in iy\y, in which 
latter some preserve it to show that it is the final 
radical: (M:) accord, to Fr, has no sing.,

the saying, J-i^JI 34~>l3^ [Equals like 

the teeth of the ass]. (TA.) It requires two [or 
more nouns for its subjects]: you say, ^y

Er-Radee, it implies wonder, [like several verbs

accord, to El-Marzookee and Hr and Zj and some

Aboo-'Othman El-Mazinee says that pLii 
and PPP may receive tenween, whether they be 
substs, or occupying the place of substs.: upon 
which AAF observes that if pLLL be in its proper 
place, it is a verbal noun, meaning LiL : if with 
tenween, it is indeterminate; if without tenween, 
determinate; and if translated from its office of a 
verbal noun, and made a subst. answering 
to ‘ "uj . 'S'i' l, and determinate, it is similar to in 
the phrase yLil y pL=4“, which is a subst. 
answering to (TA.) The p in 

(sometimes, TA) receives kesreh; (K;) though this 
is contr. to what is said by AZ and by IDrst: its 
being sometimes with kesreh is mentioned by Th, 
on the authority of Fr: and Er-Radee seems to 
infer that its being so was an opinion of As; and 
gives two reasons for his disallowal of the 
expression pm first, because occurs 

with kesr to the p; and second, because its agent 
cannot be otherwise than what denotes more 
than one: [but see what has been observed above 
on this point:] IArnb says that one must not 
say Ly j pi U plii, because, in this case, iP^ 
[virtually] governs only one noun in the nom. 
case: but that one may say, Li P'j LI pii plii ; 
and L! yj, Liyi U plli ; using pP as the dual 
of LiL; though correctly iP^ is a verbal noun: 
MF, however, observes that the Expositors of the 
Fs seem to say that Fr makes pP to be the dual 
of l±L; but that he only mentions it as a dial. var. 
of plLL; the following is adduced as an ex. Li pPA 
P ispj lsP [Different, or widely different, 
&c., are that which I intend and that which the 
sons of my father intend]: in which pLLi is read 
with both fet-hah and kesreh: and it is said in the 

O that pP is a dial. var. of p!iL. (TA.) IJ 

mentions 1 yL as an accidental syn. of plLL; and 
says that it is not the fern, of the latter: therefore 
the assertion of some, that it is used by poetical 
license in the following verse of Jemeel requires 
consideration: pjj yij pjjj ajj!

(TA:) Lth says that, applied to a man, it signifies 
one who is as though there were in him madness, 
or diabolical possession; hut Az says that this is a 
mistake; for, were this its meaning, the poets 
would not have used it in praise. (TA, in another 

part of the art.) Tall: (IDrd, Msb, K:) and so 

the fem. applied to a woman. (IDrd, Msb.) 

Bulky; big-bodied; or stout: or, as some say, 
youthful; or in a state of youthful vigour. (TA.) — 

— The lion. (Lth, S, K.) It is said in the K 

that also signifies [i. e. Time;

poet means by the expression, Ail £=A;i: but this 
cannot be the correct meaning, for the poet, 
namely El-Aasha, says, jiill ^ Ail 
by meaning himself, or some other thing.

to mind another: (A'Obeyd, Meyd, L:) the first 
who said it was Dabbeh Ibn-Udd Ibn-Tabikhah: 
he had two sons, named Saad and So'eyd: and 
some camels belonging to him ran away by night, 
so he sent his two sons to seek them; and they 
separated; and Saad found them and restored 
them; but So'eyd went on seeking them; and El- 
Harith Ibn-Kaab met him; and there were upon 
the young man two [garments such as are called] 
burds (JAw), which El-Harith asked him to give 


to him, but he refused to comply with his desire; 
whereupon he slew him, and took his two 
burds: and Dabbeh, when he saw a dark object in 
the night, used to say, 4*-“ f 1 -4AI [“ Is it Saad or 
So'eyd? ” (see ^*—)]; and this saying of his became 
current as a prov.: some time after this, having 
gone on pilgrimage, he met El- Harith Ibn-Kaab 
at 'Okadh, and saw upon him the two burds of his 
son So'eyd, and asked him respecting them; and 
he answered that he had met a young man 
wearing them, and slain him, and taken them: 
Dabbeh said, “With this thy sword? ” and he 
answered, “Yes: ” and he said, “ Give it me that I 
may look at it, for I think it to be sharp: ” and El- 
Harith gave it him: and he took it, and shook it, 
and said, j- AyAJI jl; and slew him with it: 
whereupon it was said to him, “O Dabbeh, in the 
sacred month? ” and he said, J4JI AuUl 3A

lopped off, (in consequence of which, as is said in 
the Faik, it becomes taller, MF, TA,) and that he 
who is (assumed tropical:) conspicuous for 
tallness is not thus called unless somewhat

endeavoured to excuse himself by saying that he 
had a camel which took fright and ran away, and 
he was seeking for something wherewith to 
shackle him: the Prophet used afterwards to 
taunt him by inquiring of him respecting the 
running-away of his camel: what Kr says, and J

(O:) pi. 4 (o, K, TA,) and accord, to the K 4 gil

TA;) he became, and acted, like the 444. (TA.) 
Q. Q. 2 4=4 ; *: see what next precedes. 4“ A 
rope, (S, Msb, K,) in a general sense: (K:) or a 
long rope: (Kh, S, K:) or a long and strongly- 
twisted rope by means of which one draws water: 
(TA:) pi. 44“k (S, Msb, K.) Mention is made, in a 
trad., of a horse as being J* j*4 [f e. Tied 

with two ropes, or long ropes, &c.,] because of his 
strength. (TA.) And one says of a strong-spirited 
horse, [Verily he leaps between 

two ropes, or long ropes, &c.]: a saying applied as 
a prov. to him who exults, or exults greatly, 
or excessively, and behaves insolently and 
ungratefully, and is strong. (TA.) An Arab of the 
desert described a horse (S, Msb) that did 
not become abraded in the sole of his hoof (so in 
a copy of the S) by saying, 4451 4 u'-44 4t£ [As 
though he were a devil in ropes, or long ropes, 
&c.]. (S, Msb.) 04“ ls 4 (S) or u4“ <** (K) [A

(tropical:) A deep well, (S, K, TA,) curving in its 
interior: (TA:) or a well from which the bucket is 
drawn out by means of two ropes, from its two 
sides, wide in the upper part and narrow in the 
lower part; (K, TA;) so that if one draws out 
the bucket from it by means of one rope, one 
draws it against the casing, and it becomes rent. 
(TA.) And u4“ 4 j (assumed tropical:) A long 
and crooked spear. (TA.) 0 > 4 “ Distant, or remote.

known meaning [i. e. A devil; and with the 
article J, the devil, Satan]: (S, K:) any that 
is excessively, or inordinately, proud or corrupt 
or unbelieving or rebellious, or that is insolent 
and audacious in pride and in acts of rebellion, of 
mankind, and of the jinn, or genii, and of 
beasts; (A'Obeyd, S, Msb, K;) as is shown in 
relation to the first and second of these by what is 
said in the Kur vi. 112, and ii. 13 and 96: (TA:) 
the u is radical, (S, Msb, TA,) the word being of 
the measure 34a, from o4i, (Msb, TA,) 
signifying “ he was, or became, distant, or 
remote,” (TA,) or signifying “ he was, or became, 
remote, or far, from the truth, and from the 
mercy of God; ” (Msb;) as is indicated by the 
pi. 444; [for] the reading of El-Hasan in the 
Kur xxvi. 210, u444ll, is anomalous, [like 044* 
for u4-4,] and is said by Th to be a mistake: (TA:) 
or, as some say, the 0 is augmentative, (S, Msb, 
TA, *) and the is is radical, so that the word is of 
the measure u>*i, (Msb,) from 40s, aor. -44), 
(Msb, TA,) signifying “ it was, or became, null, 
void, of no account,” and the like, and “ it 
burned,” or “ became burnt,” (Msb,) or signifying 
“ he burned with anger: ” but the former opinion 
is the more common: (TA:) [in the Kur, the word 
is always perfectly deck; and so it is said to be by 
SM, in art. 44 of the TA; unless used as a proper 
name: but J says,] if you make it to be of the 
measure J4*a from 444 said of a man, [or rather 
because they say of a man 4=44] you make it 
perfectly deck; but if you make it to be from -44 
[“ he burned ” a thing], you make it imperfectly 

deck, because it is of the measure (S.) 

Also The serpent: (S, K:) or a certain species of 
serpents; (Fr, S, TA;) having a mane, of foul 
aspect: or, as some say, a slender, light, or active, 

serpent. (TA.) Respecting the saying in the 

Kur [xxxvii. 63], u444ll 4 jjj <“ 441L [its fruit 
is as though it were the heads of the u444], Fr 
says that there are three ways in which it may 
be explained: one is, that the ^4 is likened to the 
heads of the u444 [meaning devils] in respect of 
foulness, or ugliness, because these are described 
as foul, or ugly: (S:) or it is likened to the evil 
in disposition of the jinn, because these are 
imagined as foul, or ugly: Zj says, in explaining it, 
that one says of a thing deemed foul, or ugly, 4t£ 
444 4k j [as though it were the face of a devil], 


and 444 4 j 44 [as though it were the head of 
a devil]; for though the 444 is not seen, he is 
conceived in the mind as the foulest, or ugliest, 
of things: (TA:) the second is, that [the meaning 
is foul, or ugly, serpents; for] the Arabs apply the 
name 444 to a sort of serpents, having a mane, 
foul, or ugly, in the head and face: (S, TA: *) the 
third is, that a certain foul, or ugly, plat is 
named 0«44ll o*> jjj; (S, TA;) which is expl. in 

the K only as meaning a certain plant. (TA.) 

44 444 [lit. The devil of the waterless deserts] 

means (assumed tropical:) thirst. (K.) 444 

signifies also (assumed tropical:) Any blamable 
faculty, or power, [or propensity,] of a man. (Er- 
Raghib, TA.) One says, 4J=4 <>£j i. e. (assumed 
tropical:) [His anger got the ascendency over 
him; or] he was, or became, angry. (TA.) And £ 4 
4144 (assumed tropical:) He plucked out his 
pride. (TA.) — — Also, [probably as being 
likened to a serpent,] (assumed tropical:) A mark 
made with a hot iron in the upper part of the 
haunch of a camel, perpendicularly, upon the 
thigh, extending to the hock; (K, TA;) from the “

contr. significations [in one and the same dial.]: 
he says that the two meanings are peculiar to the 
dials, of two peoples, (Msb, TA, *) each meaning 
belonging to the dial, of one people exclusively. 
(TA.) [Hence, as it seems to be indicated in the S 
and A, or from meaning “ a tribe,” as it 
seems to be indicated in the Ham p. 538,] one 
says, 3 ji>, (S,) or (A, Ham,) 

(tropical:) [Their union became dissolved, or

meaning they became separated after being

[What is this judicial decision] with which thou 
hast divided the people? (S. [In the TA, on the 
authority of IAth, P Cuxi ^ 1 , which means, 

“ which has excited evil among the people.

tropical:) The man broke up, discomposed, 
deranged, or disorganized, [or rendered

which has a similar signification, but implying 
muchness]: (S, Msb:) and [in a general sense,] he 
repaired, mended, amended, adjusted, or put 
into a right, or proper, state: (A, K, TA:) and it 
signifies the contr. also [of the former meaning 
and] of this, in the same, or in another, dial.: 
(TA:) [i. e.] he cracked a thing [such as a wooden 
bowl &c.]: (A, Msb:) and he corrupted, rendered 
unsound, impaired, or marred. (A, K, TA.)

TA.) One says, [What diverted thee,

He quitted his companions, desiring others.] One

towards them [with such a number of men], and 

quitted his companions. (K, TA.) And He, or 

it, appeared [distinct from others]: (K, TA:) 
whence the month [u 4 *-“, q. v.,] is [said to be]

2 [app. signifies He collected several things; 
or he collected much: and] he separated several 
things; or he separated much. (O.) — — Also 
He repaired a cracked wooden bowl [or some 
other vessel] in several places [by closing up its 
cracks, or by piecing it]: (S, O:) [and app., in 
a general sense, he repaired, mended, amended, 
adjusted, or put into a right, or proper, state, 
several things; or he repaired, &c., much: and it 
seems to signify also the contr. of these two 
meanings: i. e. he cracked several things; or he 
cracked in several places: and he corrupted, 
rendered unsound, impaired, or marred, several 


things; or he corrupted, &c., much.] — It is also 

intrans.: see 4. Thus, said of seed-produce, 

It branched forth, or forked, after being in leaf, or

he separated himself from another or others, 
never to return; (S, K;) as also J. or j 
accord, to different copies of the K, the latter 
as in the L. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, En- 
Nabighah El-Jaadee, (IB, TA.) ^ o* '-“Li! I jjlSj 
' (S, IB, TA,) or u-Li accord, to 

different readings: [app. meaning, And they were 
men of divided races or tribes, or were divided 
races or tribes of men; so they perished; or 
separated, never to return:] IB says, after 
mentioning the former reading, i. e. they were of 
men who should perish; so they perished: having 
previously mentioned the latter reading, and 
added, i. e. they were of those whom m j*" should 
overtake. (TA. [IB’s explanations seem at first 
sight to indicate that he read and 

neither of which is admissible: each of his 
explanations app. relates to both readings; as 
though he understood the poet to mean, they 
were men separated from different tribes, to be 
overtaken by others; so they perished.]) 5

of and the latter of s"-*: (TA:) [the former, 
therefore, is most correctly to be regarded and 
used as intensive in its significations, or 
as relating to several things or persons: but it is 
said that] both signify alike: [app. It became 
collected; it became brought, gathered, or 
drawn, together; or it became united: and also] it 
became separated, put apart or asunder, divided, 
disunited, or dispersed or scattered: (S, K:)

ass, so that he goes round: AHn says that it is of 
two species, that of the dog and that of the camel: 
that of the dog is well known, inclines to 
slenderness and redness, and touches nothing 
but the dog: that of the camel inclines to 
yellowness, is larger than that of the dog, has 
wings, and is downy under the wings: sometimes 
it is in such numbers that the owners of the 
camels cannot milk in the day-time nor ride any 
of them; so that they leave doing this until night: 
it stings the camel in the soft parts of the udder 
and around them, and beneath the tail and the 
belly and the armpits; and they do not protect the 
animal from it save by tar: it flies over the camels 
so that one hears it to make a humming, or 
buzzing, sound. (TA. [See also jjj*“, under

beast when it is frightened; and that the Arabs 
transferred its attribution from beasts to human

speaking of the ,*4“ [or intercessor] to the king

the asking, or requesting, the passing over &c.,

things, in the judgment of a man, and their being 
equal: this is sometimes because of there being 
two indications, equal in his judgment, of the two 
inconsistent things; or of there being 
no indication thereof: and sometimes it relates to 
the question whether a thing be, or be not; and 
sometimes, to the question of what kind it is; and 
sometimes, to some of its qualities; and 
sometimes, to the accident that is the cause of its 
being: it is a species of but is more special

follows:] is the thanking a benefactor; or 
praising, eulogizing, or commending, him, (S, A,) 
for a benefits: (S:) or the being grateful, or 
thankful; or acknowledging beneficence; and 
speaking of it largely; and [in the copies of the K,

on account of favour received; (K;) and u 1 is 
[the same, being] contr. of (S:) 

[sometimes] differs from (Msb in art. c^.;) 
for jSJ; is only on account of favour received; 
whereas is sometimes because of favour 
received, (Th, Az, TA in art. and Msb ubi 
supra,) and sometimes form other causes; (Th 
ubi supra;) [and thus] the latter is of more 
common application than the former; (S in 
art. ^-;) therefore you do not say ^ 

but you say (Msb ubi 

supra:) or is more common than ^ with 
respect to its kinds and means, and more 
particular with respect to the objects to which it 
relates; and the latter is more common with 
respect to the objects to which it relates, and 
more particular with respect to the means; for 
the former is, with the heart, the being humble, 
or lowly, and submissive; and with the tongue, 
the act of praising, eulogizing, or commending; 
and acknowledging beneficence; and with the 
members, the act of obeying, and submitting 
one's self; and the object to which it relates is the 
benefactor, exclusively of his essential 
qualities; therefore one does not say ^ ^ 

[we thanked God for his existence, or 
praised Him, Sec.]; hut He is on that 

account, like as He is for his beneficence; and 
is also for beneficence: thus relates to every 
object to which, as an object, relates; hut 
the reverse is not the case: and everything 
whereby is thereby is j^; but the reverse is 
not the case; for the latter is by means of 
the members, or limbs, and the former is by 
means of the tongue: is of three kinds; with 

the heart, or mind, which is the forming an 
[adequate] idea of the benefit; and with the 
tongue, which is the praising, eulogizing, or 
commending, the benefactor; and with the 
members, or limbs, which is the requiting the 


benefit according to its desert: it rests upon five 
foundations; humility of him who renders it 
towards him to whom it is rendered; his love of 
him; his acknowledgment of his benefit; the 
eulogizing him for it; and his not making use of 
the benefit in a manner which he [who has 
conferred it] dislikes: it is also explained as 
devotion of the heart to love of the benefactor, 
and of the members to obey him, and the 
employment of the tongue in mentioning 
him and eulogizing him: [and there are several 
other explanations of it which it is unnecessary to 
add:] some say that it is formed by transposition 
from jiS, the “ act of uncovering, or exposing to 
view: ” others, that it is from l s j^ “ a full 

fountain, or eye; ” accord, to which etymology it 
would signify the being full of the praise of 

the benefactor. (B, TA.) on the part of

the saying in the Kur [xii. 86], 4 461 Ail 
A 1 4! 44 J [I only show my grief and my 
lamentation to God]; and in the same [lviii. 1], 4! 

l All [And showeth her grief, or sorrow,

the opening of the small skin for water or milk 
called » 44 and showing what is in it; so that it is 
as though originally metaphorical [though what 
is termed 4a 4- (expl. in art. 4)]; like the

disease, in some one of his members; but

brute; for ex.,] As says, in explaining m^AI as 
meaning “ a certain disease that attacks the 
camel,” c4*4 [ 4 A [he has a pain in

here, as Sgh has observed: (TA:) [accord, to F, it 
seems to be a rel. n. applied to a bit, or bridle; for 
it is said to be so applied in the K, as well as in 
the O, in art. A, in which both explain it as 
meaning Difficult; and also to a skin; for 
immediately after asserting that J has committed 
a mistake, F adds,] and AA like A=s is a town 
in Armenia, whence [are brought] bits, or bridles, 
(eA) and skins, (K,) [and SM adds that they are 
termed AA but what I find J to have stated is as 
follows:] A“A [thus in one of my copies of the 
S,] or AAI, [thus in the other of those copies,] in 
relation to weapons, is an arabicized word, and is 
in Turkish A or A. (S. [But in the JM, this last 
word is written, as from the S, lA: it may 
therefore be correctly A^, or which, though 
used in Turkish, is a Pers. word,

generality of the expositors [of the Kur- an]; and 
this is said by Ibn-' Ateeyeh to be the 
most correct explanation: (TA:) said by Aboo- 
Moosa to mean the iron, or leaden, thing in 
which is the wick [of the lamp]: thought by Az to 
mean the tube which is the place of the wick in 
the glass lamp, as being likened to the which 
is thus called: (TA:) some expl. it as having this 
meaning in the Kur xxiv. 35, and say that 
the £33=*-** there mentioned is the lighted wick: 
(Bd:) accord, to Mujahid, the pillar, or the 
like, (j upon the top, or head, of which 
the £131=? [meaning lamp] is put: or the iron 
things by means of which the 3*45 [or lamp] 
is suspended: IJ says that its I is originally j, and 
hence it is [often] written » jl3* : and Zj says that 
it is an Abyssinian word, and used in the 
language of the Arabs: (TA:) [the pi. is 
like pi. of oIAIm:] Kaab says that, in the verse

says, V j 313 V [Mayest thou not experience

probably used in other senses, said of a 

mountain, &c.: see ft* below.] See also 4, 

near the end. 2 ciiiiJ; and see above, in two 
places. 3 CiLi, (k,) inf. n. (S, TA,) They 

smelt each other; (S, * K;) as also J, 1 -LSj, (K,) inf. 

n. (J-iS. (S.) [Hence,] (tropical:) Look

‘tft, S, K, TA,) and draw near to him, (K, TA,) 
and seek after the knowledge of what is with him, 
or in his mind, (»^ L.,) by means of informations 
and disclosure; as though each smelt what was 
with the other in order to act according 
thereto. (TA.) And hence the saying, p 

(tropical:) [We endeavoured, or looked, 
to ascertain their condition; then we 
engaged them in near, though not close, conflict]. 
(TA.) You say also, ilJi-jll meaning [simply] 

(assumed tropical:) I drew near to the man. 
(S.) [used tropically] signifies (assumed 

tropical:) The looking into a thing. (KL.) And 
(assumed tropical:) The approaching the enemy 
so that the two parties see each other. (S.) 4 
He made him to smell it, or perceive it by the 
nose. (K.) You say, [I made him to 

smell the perfume]. (S, Msb.) And [hence] 

one says to the prefect, or governor, or prince, or 
commander, (assumed tropical:) 

[Suffer me to approach thy hand that I may 
kiss it]; (S, * TA;) a phrase like (TA,) 

but better than the latter phrase: so says Kh. (S.) 

And and ctLil, (tropical:) 

He, and she, i. e. the operator, took, (K, TA,) or 
cut off, (TA,) a small portion of the prepuce, and 
of the jft [q. v.]: (K, TA:) or the latter signifies 
she cut off a portion of the »'jj [q. v.], 
not extirpating it. (TA.) And ■ — (s, * 


K,) inf. n. (S,) (assumed tropical:) He made 
the consonant to have a smack of the dammeh or 
the kesreh, (lit., made it to smell, S, or to taste, K, 
the dammeh or the kesreh,) in such a manner (S, 
K) that the (S,) or that the dammeh or 

kesreh, (K,) was not heard, (S, K,) what is 
termed fLuil being less than what is 

termed ft jkll ft'j, the former being apparent only 
by the motion of the lip, (S,) or of the upper lip, 
(so in one of my copies of the S,) no account 
being taken of it, (S, K,) i. e. of the dammeh or 
kesreh, (K,) it not being reckoned as a i£.ft. 
because of its feebleness, the consonant in this 
case being quiescent or like that which is 
quiescent, (S,) and the prosodical measure not 
being broken thereby: (K:) for ex., in the 
following verse, Vj Sil s ft*jji ^ u ft 
jkl [meaning Is and (as is said 
in one of my copies of the S,) i. e. When I sleep, 
he who lets beasts on hire will not render me 
wakeful by night, nor do I hear the bells of the 
camels on which people ride], the Arabs [or, as is 
said in the TA, some of the Arabs] make the j 
[in uft'jftl to have a smack of the dammeh; hut if 
you took account of the i£.ft of the [in this 
case,] the measure of the verse would be broken, 
[the foot] becoming, in the 

scanning, jictiii, which may be only in the JASf 
whereas this verse is of the ft'j: (Sb, S:) another 
case of is that of the s in ftift, [in which that 
letter is quiescent, but made to have a smack of 
kesreh,] as is the same letter in every similar 
case, in a dim. noun, when followed by a doubled 
letter. (Zj, T in art. m j .) Also He pronounced the 
consonant with a 'ftft. [or vowel-sound] between 
damm and kesr, apparent only in utterance, not 
in writing; as in Jj? and ftft in the Kur xi. 46. (I 
'Ak pp. 130 and 131.) [See also fjj, 

voce p j.] [Golius explains as signifying 

also “ Reduxit, fecit ut converteret se ah aliqua re; 
” as on the authority of the KL; in my copy of 
which, however, I do not find this meaning.] — 
(S, K,) inf. n. fLuil, [as an intrans. verb,] said 
of a man, (S,) also signifies He passed by, or 
along, raising his head; (S, K, TA;) and 
magnified, or exalted, himself; behaved proudly, 
or disdainfully; or elevated his nose, from pride. 

(TA. [See also 1, near the end.]) And He 

turned away from a thing. (K.) One says t*i ft lyj 
1 j] ft j, i. e. [While they were in a certain 
direction, lo,] they turned away; (S, TA, as from 
AA;) or J, I fti. (Thus in one of my copies of the S

oneself with the garment so as to cover with it his

he may put forth his hand, or arm: (O:) this is 
also termed jiEll; anc j sometimes one reclines in

accord, to the explanation of the lawyers, it is the 
wrapping oneself with one garment, not having 
upon him another, then raising it on one side and 
putting it upon his shoulders: [so says Sgh; and 
he adds,] he who explains it thus has regard to 
the dislike of one's uncovering himself and 
exposing to view the pudenda; and he who 
explains it as do the lexicologists dislikes one's 
covering his whole body for fear of his becoming 
in a state in which his respiration would become 
obstructed so that he would perish: (O:) or it is 
one's covering his whole body with the *33

raising aught of the sides thereof. (Msb.) [See

said that [hatred (which it signifies) is attended 
by anger and] anger is accompanied by agitation 
of the heart, there is no necessary connection 
between hatred and anger, and it is anomalous 
also as being of a measure not proper to [the inf.

that Si jit; signifies also Hatred:] or because of 
their removing far from their [original] district: 
or, accord, to El-Khafajee, because of their high 
lineage, and good deeds; from the phrase Jij 
it jit;, meaning A man of pure lineage and of 

manly virtue; and AO says the like. (TA.)

expl. by Meyd as meaning What is 
esteemed sordid, of words and of actions.] —

the latter half of the paragraph. 3 A also 

signifies The cutting [a thing] in pieces. (O, K.

[a person or thing]. (K. [See 5.]) See also 

the next paragraph, near the end. 3 inf. 
n. SJiilii and 3A, He mixed his cattle with his [i.

[contributions to the poor-rate such as are 
termed] 3AI [pi. of 3“] are incumbent on 
a man, or two men, or three, when their cattle are 
separate, and one says to another, AA i- e. Mix 
thou my cattle and thy cattle; for if they are 
separate, a 3“ will be obligatory, or incumbent, 
on each of us; and if they are mixed, the case will 
be light to us: so the 3 A signifies the sharing in 
the 3“ or in the (L, TA.) [See also what 

follows in this paragraph: and see 3A] One says 
also i 1 jiilij V [for I V] Ye shall not put 
together what are separate [of cattle]; 3 i 'All 

being syn. with SilAll. (TA.) 3A signifies 

also The taking somewhat from the 3A and 
hence the trad., 3A V: (K, TA:) this means There 
shall not be taken from the 3^ [any contribution 
to the poorrate] unless it is complete [in 
number]: (A’ Obeyd, S, TA:) the 3^ being, of 
camels, such as exceed five, up to ten; and what 
exceed ten, up to fifteen: (A 'Obeyd, TA:) Aboo- 
Sa'eed Ed-Dareer says, up to nine; and up to 
fourteen: but this is pronounced in the L to be 
wrong: (TA:) [Mtr also says,] it means there shall 
not be taken aught of what exceed five, up to 
nine, for example: or, accord, to Aboo-Sa'eed Ed- 
Dareer, it is like the mixing; but this requires 
consideration: (Mgh:) Aboo-Sa'eed says that V 
3 A means a man shall not adjoin Q 3A ^ [thus 
written here and thus expl. in the TA]) his sheep 
or goats, and his camels, to the sheep or goats 
[and the camels] of another person, in order to 
annul what is obligatory, or incumbent, on him, 
of the poor-rate: this is [for instance] in the case 
in which each of them has forty sheep or goats; 
so that it is incumbent on them to give two sheep 
or goats; but when one of them adjoins ( J, Ui.i=J 
3^ A [thus in this instance in the TA, perhaps a 
mistranscription for 3A]) his sheep or goats to 
those of another, and the collector of the poorrate 
finds them in his [the latter's] possession, he 
takes from them one sheep or goat. (TA.) 4 3A 

see 1, in five places. 3A [as inf. n. of 3A 

from AA 3^1 expl. in the first paragraph,] also 
signifies The having the hand attached to the 

neck by means of a 3^ [q. v.]. (AA, TA.) See 

also 3, in the latter half. — Accord, to IAar, (O, 
TA,) 3“! also signifies He took (O, K, TA) 
the 3A i. e., (O, TA,) the [fine termed] uA: (O, 
K, TA:) or it was, or became, obligatory, or 


incumbent, on him to give the uSjl; thus having 
two contr. meanings [assigned to it]: (K:) or it 
signifies also, accord, to IAar, it was, or became, 
obligatory on him to give what is termed a 3A 
and this is the case until his camels amount to 
five and twenty, when what is due of them is [a 
she-camed such as is termed] lA-A A!. (O.) A 
man of the Arabs said, 3A u-“ A, which may 
mean Of us is he who gives the 3A i. e. cords, pi. 
of 3'A or it may mean, who gives the 3A i.

termed AJJ of camels, and of sheep or goats, 
(M, TA,) in relation to the poorrate: (S, Mgh, K, 
TA:) so called because nothing is taken 
therefrom; so that it is adjoined (3A i. e. AA) 
to that [number] which is next to it [of the 
numbers below it]: (JK:) accord, to some, it is 
syn. with 3A j; (Mgh, Msb;) but some say that it 
relates peculiarly to camels; (M, Mgh, Msb;) 
and lAj, to bulls and cows: (Mgh, Msb:) used in 
relation to sheep or goats, it is what is between 
forty and a hundred and twenty; and in like 
manner as to other numbers [that impose the 
obligation of giving a A=jjs] ; K, TA:) Ahmad Ibn- 
Hambal is related to have said that the 3“ is 
what is above the S-Ajs, absolutely; as, for 
instance, what is above forty sheep or goats: (TA: 
[I here render the word uj j “ above,” though it 
also means “ below,” because nothing is due from 
sheep or goats fewer than forty:]) as A'Obeyd 
says, it is, of camels, such as exceed five, up to 
ten; and what exceed ten, up to fifteen: (O, * TA: 
[see also 3:]) Ks states, on the authority of some 
one or more of the Arabs, that it is up to twenty- 
five; and says that it is what does pot impose the 
obligation of the ^Ajs; meaning what is between 
five and twenty-five: (Fr, TA:) [but it is also expl. 
as applied to the due itself that is to be 
contributed to the poorrates for certain numbers 
of camels: thus] Aboo- 'Amr Esh-Sheybanee says, 
the 3^ for five camels is a sheep or goat; for ten, 
two sheep or goats; for fifteen three sheep or 
goats; and for twenty, four sheep or goats; the 
term 3“ being applied alike to the sheep or 
goat, and to the two sheep or goats, and to the 
three sheep or goats, and to the four sheep or 
goats; what exceeds this last being 
termed AJ: (TA:) or, in the case of the poor- 


rate, the lowest JAVI 3AJI) 3A is a sheep or

All jji): (As, S, O, Msb, K:) the term 3' A, (S, M, 
Msb,) pi. of 3A (M,) being applied to the fines, 
for wounds, that are sent with the complete

rests the obligation to send such; (S, O, Msb;) as 
though they were attached to the main, 
or greatest, fine: (S, M, * O:) and an addition, in 
the bloodwit, (M, Msb,) of five, (M,) or of six, (M, 
Msb,) or of seven, (Msb,) to the hundred camels 
[which constitute the complete bloodwit], (M, 
Msb, *) in order that it may be described as 
ample: (Msb:) [for,] as IAar and As and El- 
Athram say, the man of rank or quality, when he 
gave [the bloodwit], used to add to it five [or 
more] camels, to show thereby his excellence and 
his generosity: (TA:) a redundancy [in the case of 
the bloodwit]; (O, K;) one of the explanations of 
the term given by As: (O:) or in the case of 
bloodwits (AA, the lowest JAVI 3AI) 3A is 
twenty camels whereof every one is a A-A 
and the highest 3^ (JA 3^1) is twenty camels 
whereof every one is a A A: (O, K:) and some say 
that AA 3Ai means the sorts of bloodwits; the 
bloodwit for purely-unintentional homicide being 
a hundred camels, which those who 
are responsible for it undertake to give in fifths, 
consisting of twenty whereof every one is an A 
A-A and twenty whereof every one is an A) 
OjJI, and twenty whereof every one is an uA A!, 
and twenty whereof every one is a A, and twenty 
whereof every one is a these also being 

termed 3' A. (TA.) It signifies also A fine, or 

mulct, for a wound or the like; (O, Msb, K;) as, 
for instance, for a burn, (O, TA,) or such as a 
wound on the head that lays bare the bone, (Msb, 
TA,) and other wounds, (Msb,) and for a tooth 
[knocked out], and for an eye blinded, and for an 
arm or a hand vitiated, or rendered unsound and 
motionless, or stiff; and for anything short of 
what requires the complete bloowit: (TA:) or, as 
some say, a fine for that which does not render

substance, and such that it may be known, and 
that a thing may be predicated thereof: (KT:) MF 
says that it is app. an inf. n. used in the sense of a 
pass. part, n., meaning what is willed, and meant, 
or intended, [in which sense j k±kii (pi. cjUAi) is 
often used,] without restriction to its actuality 
or possibility of being, so that it applies to that 
which necessarily is, and that which may be, and 
that which cannot be; accord, to the 
opinion adopted by the author of the Ksh: [or, as 
an inf. n. in the sense of a pass. part, n., it may be 
expl., agreeably with what is said to be the proper 
meaning of the verb, as signifying what is caused 
to be or exist; accordingly,] Er-Raghib says that it 
denotes whatever is caused to be or exist, 
whether sensibly, as material substances, or 
ideally, as sayings; and Bd and others expressly 
assert that it signifies peculiarly what is caused to 
be or exist; but Sb says that it is the most general 
of general terms; and some of the scholastic 
theologians apply it to what is non-existent; such, 
however, are overcome in their argument by 
its not being found to have been thus used by the 
Arabs, and by such passages as VI AJU jyi 
ks-kj [Everything is subject to perish 
except Himself (Kur xxviii. last verse)] and o? u! j 
jtOjj VI cyA [And there is not anything but it 
glorifies Him with praising (Kur xvii. 46)], for 
what is nonexistent cannot be described as 
perishing nor imagined to glorify God: (TA:) the 
pi. is (s, Msb, K, &c.,) imperfectly deck, 
(Msb, TA,) or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., 
(Sb, TA,) respecting the formation of which there

hereafter], (Msb, TA,) and oljljii, (S, K,) a pi. pi.

or is jlA, but is jkA only is meant by J, as is shown 
by what here follows,] originally ykAl, with 
three s s, not ylAl as J says, [or rather as the 
word is written in copies of the S, for J may 
have held it to be ylAi or iyk“l, as he says that 
the » was changed into s thus occasioning the 


combination of three ss, so that he held 
its secondary form to be ylAl, as will presently be 
shown,] because the first s is radical, not 
augmentative, (IB, K,) the medial s of the 
three being suppressed, and the final one 
changed into I [though written s], and the initial 
one changed into j, (S,) and another form of pi. 
is Alii, (s, Msb, K,) with the s preserved, not 
changed into j [as it is in lSjIAI], (TA,) [likewise] 
a pi. of AliAl, (Msb,) and AAA also is mentioned, 
(K,) as formed [from iAA] by the change of « 
into s and adding I, (TA,) and »jAA, which is 
strange, (Lh, K,) as there is no » in AlkA, (Lh,) or 
in e(s-A (K:) with respect to the first of 
these forms, [the quasi-pl. n.] AlkAl, the most 
probable opinion is that of Kh: (Msb, TA:) 
accord, to him, (S, Msb, K,) it is originally of 
the measure iAAi, (S, K, *) in lieu of 3 -*ai, (K,) and 
therefore imperfectly deck, (S,) [i. e.] it is 
originally iAjA ; (Msb,) and the two 
hemzehs combined in the latter portion being 
found difficult of pronunciation, the former of 
them is transposed to the beginning of the word, 
so that it becomes of the measure (Ail ; (s, Msb,) 
as is shown by its having for its pis. i^jAil and AAil 
and AjIjUA: (S:) accord, to Akh, it is [originally] 
of the measure (S, K;) but if it were thus a 
broken ph, [not a quasi-pl. n.,] its dim. would not 
be J, iiAil, as it is, but AjAIA (S:) accord, to Ks, it is 
of the measure J-*A, and made imperfectly deck 
because of frequency of usage, being likened 
to iAAi; but were it so, A-Al and AaAI would be 
imperfectly deck: (S, K:) accord, to Fr, £yA is 
originally yA and therefore has a ph of 
the measure «AAil, afterwards contracted to eAAi; 
but were it so, it would not have for its ph lSjAA. 
(S. [Much more respecting this ph is added in the 
TA, but it is comparatively unprofitable.]) The 
dim. of «yk is J, £yA and [ «yA; (S, K, TA, but 
only the former in some copies of the K, the word 
being written in other copies *you»;) not f is is A,

of the S and accord, to the copies of the K

[app. lit. signifying How unmindful of thee is he 
as to anything!] mentioned by Sb as meaning £ 1 
4A 4411 [Dismiss doubt from thee (respecting 
him as to anything)]: IJ says that 6A is here put 
in the accus. case as an inf. n., as though the 
saying were 4A <lAi U, because the verb of 
wonder does not require to be corroborated by 
the inf. n. [proper to it]: (L, TA:) [or it is a 
specificative:] IF says that it is a phrase 
of dubious meaning; and that the most probable 
explanation of it is this; that 6- is here lit. 
interrogative, but in meaning denotative of 
wonder; and that 6A is governed in the accus. 
case by some other word, or phrase, as though 
the saying were dismiss a thing by which he is 
not occupied in mind, and dismiss doubt as to his 

being occupied in mind by it. (TA in art. A.)

(TA.) 4 Anything with which a wall is plastered, 
(S, A, K,) consisting of gypsum and the like; (A, 
K;) J says, of gypsum or 44; but this last word is 
a mistake, [probably originated by an early 
transcriber of the S,] for -LiU, i. e. mud, or clay: 

(K:) or [peculiarly] gypsum. (Msb.) Az says 

that some of the Arabs sometimes call thus 
A 4 [i. e. fortress, fort, or fortified 

place]. (TA.) 4“ Plastered with 4; and so, as 
some say, J, 44 (T:) or built with gypsum: 
(Msb:) or made with 4, (S, A, K,) i. e. gypsum; 
and so, some say, 4 44 (A:) or the latter 
signifies raised high, or made lofty; (A ’Obeyd, S, 
A, K;) and so the former, applied to a place, 
(A,) or building: (TA:) the former has this 
meaning in the Kur xxii. 44: (Jel:) J says in the S, 
Ks says, 4“ is applied to a sing., from the saying 
in the Kur, [ubi supra,] 4“ 4 s ® j; and 4 4-4, to a 
pi., from the saying in the same, [iv. 80 ,] £ jjj 4 
s 44 : but this is a mistake: what Ks says is 
that “4*4, with » and teshdeed, is a pi. [i. e. 
a lexicological, not a grammatical, pi.] of 4*4: 
(IB, K: *) or the saying of Ks [if as quoted in the 
S] may be expl. accord, to the opinion of those 
who hold that 4“ and 4-4 both signify plastered 
with 4, on the supposition that the Arabs did 
not use “44 as applied to a pi., but only to a 
sing.: (Az, L:) [for] Fr says that the pass. part. n. 
of the unaugmented verb only is used when 
applied to a sing, and not denoting repetition, or 
muchness; but either this or the pass. part. n. of 
the verb of the measure may be used when 
applied to a sing, and denoting repetition, or 
muchness, and when applied to a pi.: thus 
you say £ j4 44 [“ a slaughtered ram ”]; but 
not hut you may say 34=4 44 [as meaning “ 
a garment in which holes have been repeatedly 
made,” or “ in which many holes have been 
made,” or “ much pierced with holes,” as well 
as 44 meaning “ a garment in which a 

hole has been made,” or “ in which holes have 
been made,”] and 3*4 [“ slaughtered 

rams ”]: and hence you may say 4 4*4 >4a; 
because 44“ denotes building, and the act of 
building is repeated, and a building becomes high 
by degrees. (L.) 4*4: see the next preceding

says of the lS j 4, by the name of which the Arabs 
call bowls (o4 and ^L-aS) and the sheaves of 
pulleys, that it is walnut-wood, but it becomes 
blackened by grease, and therefore is thus called, 
and it is not 4: so says AHn: and he adds, the 
case is as he has described it; for the 4 does not 
become thick so as that bowls may be carved 
from it: (Sgh, TA:) of this latter, only combs and 
the like are made; and it is black: it is also said, in

burnt: (TA:) and, said of clarified butter, and of

it burned; (S;) because, in that case, it perishes;

(tropical:) He became inflamed by anger; 
against him: (K, TA:) or he became as though he 
were inflamed in his anger; accord, to As,

he burned, and became inflamed, by vehement 
anger. (TA.) — — (tropical:) He (a man, TA)

(TA.) J-44 [i. e. 4=4 or 4 = 4 , accord, to 
different authorities, as shown below, A devil; 
and with the article Jt, the devil, Satan;] is, 
accord, to some, from -44, (Msb, K, TA,) as 
signifying “ it was, or became, null, void, of 
no account; ” and the like: (Msb, TA:) or “ he 
perished: ” (K, TA:) or “ he went away: ” or “ it 
burned,” or “ became burnt: ” two reasons given 
for this derivation are, that among the names of 


the devil are 4411 and J44 : and another is this; 
that several read, in the Kur xxvi. 210 , jjj=l4ll 
[instead of u4l4ll]; but some say that it is 
from 44, signifying “ he became distant,” or “ 
remote: ” Sb gives both of these derivations: 
respecting the former of which, it should be 
observed that if from -44 as signifying “ it 
burned,” or “ became burnt,” it is proper; but if 
from the same in any of the other senses 
mentioned above, it is tropical: and if belonging 
to this art., it is imperfectly deck, being of the 
measure (S in art. 44 in which see it:) 

[but in the Kur-an it is always perfectly deck: and 
SM says that] it is perfectly deck, unless used as a

as also j and o“, because proceeding from the tip

termed 44, which are obstacles to 4I ; (M in 
art. - >-=:) it is not conjoined with u“, nor with j,

Arabic word. (TA. [See also art. -j--=.]) It is 
a radical, and a substitute; not an augmentative. 
(M in art. ■>>“=.) It is sometimes substituted 
for i_>“; and, as MF observes, what Ibn-Umm- 
Kasim says appears to mean that this 
substitution is allowable unrestrictedly; but Ibn- 
Malik, in the Tes-heel, makes it subject to 
conditions, saying that it is allowable accord, to a 
certain dial, when the u= is followed by £ or £ 
or (j or -1=, even when separated therefrom by a

literally (as in the instances above) or virtually

One who gives what is termed [meaning

substitution [of for 1=] and incorporation [of

omen: (Msb:) there are two species thereof; one 
species is called by the people of El-'Irak lS^LII [a

whiteness of its belly; and f.i i -A Vt, because of the

woodpecker, picus viridis], because of its

arm and the part between his right shoulder- 
joint and neck, so as to cover them both: 
(A'Obeyd, S, K:) or the wrapping oneself with the 
garment without making to it a place from which 
to put forth the hand: (Msb:) or, (K,) as the 
lawyers explain it, (A'Obeyd, S,) it is the 
wrapping one's body and arms with one garment, 
not having upon him another, and then raising it 
[in the K, as is said in the TA, <<-44 is erroneously 


put for 4a jj] on one of its sides, and putting it 
upon his shoulder, so that his pudendum appears 
from it: (A'Obeyd, S, K:) [but] with the Arabs, 441 
»ULall means the covering one's whole body with 
his garment, and not raising a side from which to 
put forth his hand: (Mgh:) when you say, of a

And accord, to Ibn-'Abbad, followed in the O and 
TS and K, one says also, i34AI A 3 '* meaning 
The unskilful learned, and did soundly,

a mistake, occasioned by his deeming dubious, or 
obscure, a passage in the Nawadir of IAar, where

A noun significant of a sound: nouns of this 


kind being of two classes; namely, nouns applied 
to the purpose of addressing irrational beings, or 
what are virtually in the predicament of irrational 
beings, as young infants; and onomatopoeias, or 
nouns imitative of sounds: the former class 
consists of two descriptions of words; namely, 
ejaculations used for the purpose of chiding, 
as A* (to horses) and (to mules) and jA 
(to a young infant); and ejaculations used for the 
purpose of calling, as (to camels) and A" (to 
an ass): of the other class are jA (imitative of the 
cry of the crow) and 3^ (imitative of the sound 
produced by the falling of stones) and m 5 
(imitative of the sound produced by the fall of a 
sword) &c.: nouns significant of sounds are 
generally indecl., because they resemble certain 
particles in neither governing nor being 
governed; but some of them are occasionally deck 
[like other nouns]. (ElAshmoonee’s Expos, of the 
Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Malik, section JAiVI cAA
