PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 



The eighth letter of the alphabet: called l 4. It is 
one of the letters termed [or vocal, i. e. 

pronounced with the voice, not with the breath 
only]; and of the letters termed 4*4 
[pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue 
against the upper gums and suddenly 
withdrawing it], like -4 and 4 . (TA.) It is 
substituted, agreeably with general usage, for 
the cii of the form iU*3al and its variations, when 
the first radical letter is j, as in -4jl [for 4 j!]; 
or i, as in [for j 43I ; originally j43l]; 0 r ■>, as 
in [for 0-4J, originally '>)!]; and sometimes 
after j, as in I j*-«4J ; a dial. var. of I j*44!: also, 
sometimes, for the pronominal affix 4 after ■>, as 
in jfy- for 431k; and after j, as in for 4 >=>•: it is 

also substituted for the 4 of ^jj, contr. to 
analogy: and it occurs substituted for - 1 =, contr. 
to general usage, as in ijVj* for (MF.) —

sped, and ran, or rose in his running; syn. j £ j4i 
>4J : (K:) accord, to AA, i M3 is [a subst., 
or quasiinf. n., signifying] a quick pace or manner 
of going: and [the inf. n.] 413 is syn. with 
and in the Nawadir [app. of Aboo- 
Amr EshSheybanee] it is said that I3j3 (inf. 
n. 4j3) and (inf. n. 4^2) and iijS (inf. n. 4j£) 
are syn. with 13c.; and that 413 and ( A- signify a 
camel's proceeding with short steps, at a rate 
quicker than that of the pace termed 4*- [q. v.]: 
accord, to the Kf, these two words signify the 
going a pace quicker than that termed [q. v.], 
not so quick as that termed [q. v.]. (TA.) You 
say, 41313 The beast ran a pace quicker than 
that termed 3^-- (M.) And ?>J ^ 4- He followed 
him, having him near before him. (M, * K, * TA.) 
And hence, 1313 He ran (> 4 ki) to escape from 
him, being followed by him, and being near 
before him; as also i 13131. (M.) — He put a thing 

in motion. (M, K.) And, contr.. He rendered 

a thing, still, or motionless. (M, K.) R. Q. 2 t3l3l; 

see above. Also It (a stone, TA) rolled; or

TA,) and went away: IAth says that it may be 


from »3*3l. (TA.) It became, or was put, in 

motion. (TA.) And, contr., It became, or was 

rendered, still, or motionless. (TA.) 1313; see Mi, 
in three places. Mi inf. n. of R. Q. l [q. v.]. (S, M, 
K.) — — Also The hasty replying of a foolish, 

or stupid, person. (T, TA.) The sound of the

poetic license, 4 : (M:) or the iM- are three 
nights of the latter part of the month, 
before those called 3441 ^LJ; (T, S:) thus says A 
'Obeyd; and IAar says the like: or they are the 
three nights that are after the 3^-»; and are 
so called because the moon hastens therein to 
become invisible; from the phrase j#*31l shl3 : As 
says that three of the nights of the month 
are called the 3^-»; and three, the lS- 4; and these 
latter are the last; and AHeyth says the like. (T.) 
i M31I signifies also The last part of the night.

phrase immediately preceding. (Mgh, Msb.) It is

latter of them in many other instances: in the S

present day. This latter signification may also be 
intended in the S, M, A, Msb, and K, by 
the explanation “ contr. of JA,” as well as the “ 
back, or hinder part,” of anything: for lA very 
often signifies the “ anterior pudendum ” of 
a man or woman, and is so explained. The anus is 
also called jA Ai. and jA jA and jA £ A.] 
Its pi. jA is also applied to the part which 
comprises the cAl [or anus] and the A [or 
vulva, i. e., external portion of the female organs 
of generation,] of a solid-hoofed animal, and of a 
cloven-hoofed animal, and of that which has 
claws, or talons: or, as some say, of a camel, or an 
animal having feet like those of the camel: and

such animal. (M, TT.) (assumed tropical:)

conclusions, of the prayers]. (A.) See also is A. In 
the Kur [I. xxxix.], -AA jA' 3 signifies (assumed 
tropical:) And in the latter parts, or the ends, of 
the prayers: and jA]j [ AA [virtually] signifies 
the same [i. e. and in the ending of 
prostration], and is another reading of the text: 
Ks and Th adopt the former reading, because 
every single prostration has its latter part: or, 
accord, to the T, the meaning is, and in the two 
rek'ahs (lAAO after sunset; as is related on the 
authority of 'Alee the son of Aboo-Talib. (TA.) 
The similar expression in the Kur [lii. last 
verse] jA' j is explained by the lexicologists 
as signifying (assumed tropical:) And during the 
consecution of the stars, and their taking towards 
the west, to set: but [ISd says,] I know not how 
this is, since A by which they explain it, is an 
inf. n., and jAl is a pi. of a subst.: jAjj j. eA-A 
which is another reading of the text, signifies and 
during the setting of the stars: and Ks and Th 
adopt this latter reading: (M:) or, accord, to the

daybreak. (TA.) Also The hinder part, (M,)

this [says ISd] is the best explanation that I have 
seen of » A: (M:) or (so accord, to the M, but in 
the K “ and ”) it signifies (assumed tropical:) the 
issue, or result, of a thing or an affair or a case; 
(M, K;) as in the saying of Aboo-Jahl to Ibn- 
Mes'ood, when he [the former] lay prostrate, 
wounded, »A" A (assumed tropical:) In 
whose favour is the issue, or result? and was 
answered, “In favour of God and his apostle, O

also 1 »A, (S,) and 1 »jA: (IAar, A, K:) you

His adversary was defeated; and Ac meaning 
(tropical:) He was himself defeated: (A:) and A 
»jA, meaning (assumed tropical:) Who is 
the defeater? and “ jA A 3 (assumed tropical:)

sense is jA: (TA:) which also signifies conflicts

God caused, or may God cause, to befall them 
conflicts and defeats. (TA.) — See also A, in two 
places. » A The direction, or point, towards which 
one turns his back; contr. of AS. (S, K.) One

is not known. (S, A.) See also »jAJ. — And 

see A- 3 , near the end. “ A: see “A: — and see 
also A. s A: see 1. is A: see the next paragraph,

learning answers thee quickly; but the backward 
says, I must consider it. (Th, T.) And eA" •* 

JA (assumed tropical:) I followed my

the knowledge of] the real nature of his hallowed

My knowledge comprehended that such a thing

intrans. v., or a trans. v. of which the objective

signifies [He attained a knowledge of the

the uttermost of a thing. (TA.) See also 6, in the 

former half of the paragraph, in two places. 

Also It (a thing) attained its proper time: (Msb, 
K:) it attained its final time or state, or its utmost 
point or degree. (K.) [He (a boy, and a beast,) 
attained his perfect, ripe, or mature, state; and in 
like manner ^ ji i$ said of a girl: or it is like 4

(Msb and K in art. _>**•.) And if-* 3 j3 The 
water of the well reached its 3 Jj ; i. e. its bottom 
(Aboo-' Adnan, TA.)— — Also It passed away 

and came to an end; came to nought; became 
exhausted; or failed entirely: (S, K:) said in this 
sense of flour, or meal: (S:) and thus it has 
been explained as used in the Kur [xxvii. 68], 
where it is said, [accord, to one reading,] 3 Jsl Jj 
J* [Nay, their knowledge hath 

entirely failed respecting the world to come]. (TA. 
[See also 6.]) Sh mentions this signification as 
heard by him on no other authority than that 
of Lth; and Az asserts it to be incorrect: but it has 
been authorized by more than one of the leading 
lexicologists, and the language of the Arabs does 
not forbid it; for it is said of flour, or meal, and in 
this case can only mean it came to its end, and 
entirely failed, or became exhausted; and fruits, 
when they are ripe (ejSjjl bl) are exposed 
to coming to nought, and so is everything that 
has attained to its extreme term; so that the 
signification of “ coming to nought ” is one of 
the necessary adjuncts of the meaning of 3l jjl. 
(TA.) [In like manner,] i 3ji signifies It (a 
thing) continued uninterruptedly and then come 
to nought: (IJ, TA:) and agreeably with this 
signification is explained the saying in the Kur 
[xxvi. 6i], up UJ [Verily we are coming 
to nought, by those who read thus instead 

of jjljjul being overtaken]. (TA.) You say 

also, is jji-kll Jjull 3 ji, meaning [The payment 
of] the price was, or became, obligatory on the 
purchaser: this is an ideal reaching, or 

overtaking. (Msb.) 6 1 J3 i. q. 1 (S) [i. e.] 


They attained, reached, overtook, or came up 
with, one another; as also I jSjbl, and j I 
(Sh, TA;) [or] the last of them attained, reached, 
overtook, or came up with, the first of them. (S 
Msb, K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 36], (S,) ^3=- 
1-4*1 I jSjbl bl [Until, when they have 

overtaken one another, or have successively 

arrived, therein, all together]: originally IjSjIjj. 
(S, K. *) And u^j3I 3 Jj! [The two moistures 
reached each other; (like yljjjll 15“!;) 

meaning] the moisture of the rain reached the 

moisture of the earth. (S.) And [hence] 3 Jj! 

signifies [It continued, or was carried 
on, uninterruptedly; it was closely consecutive in 
its parts, or portions;] one part, or portion, of it, 
followed, or was made to follow, 

another uninterruptedly; said of anything. (TA.) 
You say, jj31l 3 Jj! [The course, or pace, or 
journeying, continued uninterruptedly]. (S and 
TA in art. &c.) And JjiVl cA Jj! The tidings 

followed one another closely. (TA.) [Hence, 

when said of knowledge, meaning, accord, to Fr, 
It continued unbroken in its sequence or 
concatenation.] j -ill jjl Jl (K, TA,) in 
the Kur [xxvii. 68], (TA,) [virtually] means Nay, 
they have no knowledge respecting the world to 
come: (K, TA:) or, as IJ says, their knowledge is 
hasty, and slight, and not on a sure footing, &c.: 
Az says that AA read 3jjl 3) [of which an 
explanation has been given above (see 4)]: that 
TAb is related to have read j 3jjiUl [&c., i. e. 
Yea, hath their knowledge reached its end &c.?], 
as interrogatory, and without tesh-deed: and 
that, accord, to the reading 31 jjl Jj Fr says that 
the proper meaning is, [Nay,] hath their 
knowledge continued unbroken so as to extend to 
the knowledge of the world to come, whether it 
will be or not be? wherefore is added, 33 ^ ^ Jl 
4L -a Jj tJL> ; he says also that Ubei read, fl 
3jl3; and that the Arabs substitute 3) for ft, 
and fl for 3), when a passage begins with 
an interrogation: but this explanation of Fr is not 
clear; the meaning is [said to be] their knowledge 
shall be unbroken and concurrent [respecting the 
world to come] when the resurrection shall have 
become a manifest event, and they shall have 
found themselves to be losers; and the truth of 
that wherewith they have been threatened shall 
appear to them when their knowledge thereof 
will not profit them: accord, to Aboo-Mo'adh the 
Grammarian, the readings j 3jjl Jj &c. and Jj 
3jbl &c. mean the same; i. e. they shall know in 
the world to come; like the saying in the Kur [xix. 
39], 3-4 ' j hi £-43 &c.: and Es-Suddee says of 
both these readings that the meaning is, their 
knowledge shall agree, or be in unison, in the 
world to come; i. e. they shall know in the world 


to come that that wherewith they have been 
threatened is true: or, accord, to Mujahid, the 
meaning of fi-3c. 3 JjI Jj &c. is said to be, is 
their knowledge concurrent respecting the world 
to come? Jj being here used in the sense of J: 
(TA:) or it may mean their knowledge hath gone 
on uninterruptedly until it hath become cut 
short; from the phrase iP^ Jj 3 Jj! meaning The 
sons of such a one went on uninterruptedly 
into destruction. (Bd.) — <£ J3; see 4, in two 
places. It is used in the [primary] sense of 31 jii in 
the saying in the Kur [lxviii. 49 ], 331 31Jjj ji V jl 
J J3J jjl 3j j* [Had not favour (meaning mercy, 
Jel) from his Lord reached him, or overtaken 
him, he had certainly been cast upon the bare

(W p. 35. [The verse there commences with 3; 
but J is required by the metre, and is more 
approved in every case except the case of a

relief, and benefaction: [so that it signifies He 
aided, or relieved, him; he benefited him; he 
repaired his, or its, condition; he repaired,

art. J$e.) [In the KT, Pijpll is also explained as 
signifying The purchaser's taking from the seller

weight of five; and some were of the weight of 
twelve [carats], and were called the weight of six; 
and they put the three weights together, and 
called the third part thereof the weight of seven:

was twelve carats, which is six i 3 A A but the A A 
is sixteen carats; the of this being 
a carat and two thirds: (Msb:) or dirhems should 
be fourteen carats [i. e. seven daniks]; ten being

demolished. (K.) He broke a wall, and 
a mountain. (Lth, TA.) He beat a thing and broke 
it so as to lay it even with the ground. (S.) Hence 
the saying in the Kur [lxix. 14 ], »3=J j 352 453s, (S,) 
i. e. And they shall be beaten together with one 
beating, and the whole shall become fine dust: or

and without mountains: or it means,

demolished and non-existent. (Jel.) See also 33 

below. 33 also signifies The spreading (o“3 

[for which u35 is erroneously put in the CK]) of 
earth, and making it even. (K.) When a roof, or

says of the stallion-camel when he covers, 3.535

shown by an explanation of its fern, in this 
paragraph:] or land, or ground, broken, and

in the former instance, and shall make it, in the 
latter instance,] even, or level, (AZ, Az, Ibn- 
'Arafeh,) without any hill: (Ibn- 'Arafeh: 

[this addition relating to the former instance:]) or 
crumbled: (Ksh, * Bd:) or, accord, to Akh, IS- 2 may 
be here an inf. n.; as though the meaning were 
l ISi ASS; [see 1:] or it may be elliptical, 
meaning 33 4 3*4; another reading is J, 333 3**., 
(S,) meaning in the former instance a hill rising 
from the ground like the 343; (Ksh:) or 
meaning 533 Ui jl 34*, (S,) i. e. He made it even, 
or level, ground; (Ksh, Bd;) because the word Ji4 

[to which 352 virtually relates] is masc. (S.)

irregular, pi. of the same,] is said to signify

& c., generally built against a wall]: (Msb:) 
pronounced by the vulgar J, 352 [and commonly 
applied by them to a long seat of wood]: (TA:) 
and J, 03- 2 signifies the same; (S, Msb, K;) but 
accord, to some, this belongs to art. u^- 2 [q. v.]: (S, 
Msb, TA:) the pi. of the former is 352, like as the 
pi. of 3*4*9 is j— *s : (Msb:) and the pi. of j 03- 2 
is u3l53. (TA.) [For another modern application,

amounting to a mountain: (TA:) or the pi. 
signifies natural [mounds, or hills, of dust or 
earth, such as are called] J54 : (TA:) the pi. 
is Ciljl£3, (As, S, M, K,) because it is used as a 
subst.: (TA:) or it has no sing.: (K:) ISd says, this 
is what the lexicologists say; but in my opinion 
the sing, is 433. (TA.) 03- 2 : see 352, in two places:

and he answered, "I ask of God Paradise, and

seeking Paradise and the praying for protection 
from the fire [of Hell]; and on account of them: 
(JM:) accord, to some, it is from ApII Jj 33 CP 3 - He 
went round about the water: [hence it may mean 
we utter our prayer respecting them with a low,

about them like flies; seeking to enter the one, 
and to keep outside the other:] As says that it 
may be from the signification of the sound [of 
buzzing], or from that of going round about: 
(TA:) or, accord, to one relation, the Prophet 


said, Op 3 - 13 ' 3 4 3t [From a consideration of them we 
utter our prayer with a low, or faint, voice;] i. e. 
our pppjp arises from them; and is because of

different copies of the S:) whence uiu 343 and

habitual liar: and accord, to AZ, the Arabs used to 
say, Uli -ilic jin* 3 V glj 3 * 3 [Lies will not avail thee 
aught]: and O 343 signifies the same as j 34 - 3 . (TA.) 
— — lij 343 is also a noun, (K,) i. e. a verbal 
noun, (TA,) signifying He was, or has become, 
unoccupied, or without work; syn. (K;) 

like for £ and cil* 34 for 3,3 . (TA.) Hence 
the prov., (TA,) ui^l jjj 343 , (As, K,) without 
the conjunction j [after the first 
word], and uu 343 being written as one word, 
(TA,) meaning Saad the blacksmith became, or 
has become, unoccupied, or without work; not 
being employed because of the people's being 
diverted from other things by drought (As, K) 
and distress. (TA.) Some say u^l ■ 3c '- j : and Aboo- 
'Obeydeh Maamar Ibn-El-Muthenna relates it 
thus: jP -i*— uu 343 , with in the accus. case, 
and says that uu 343 is governed in the accus. case 
by a verb understood; apparently meaning that it 
is a noun signifying dual of j- 343 , not a 

verbal noun, as though the prov. meant Cast ye 
away what is false, or vain, and Saad the 
blacksmith: but what he says is not correct. (TA.) 
Or a certain blacksmith asserted his name to be 
Saad for some time, and then his lying became 
manifest; so this was said to him; meaning, Thou 
hast added falsehood to falsehood, O Saad the 
blacksmith. (K.) It is also related separately; (K;) 
and so J and others relate it; saying uu 3 » 3 : (TA:) 
[in one copy of the S, I find it written ujj 3 » 3 : in 
another, » 3 [:ujj 3 » 3 being an imperative 
from ilAjll; its final radical letter being 


J 

transposed to the place of the medial, so that 
it becomes »j 3 , and the j being then rejected 
because of the two quiescent letters, (K,) so that 
it becomes » 3 , like as is done in the case 
of 3 : (TA:) and ju 3 being from j 3 , “it was 
consecutive; ” (K;) by the dual form being meant 
repetition, as in the case of i ^ 33 i &c.: (TA:) so 
that the meaning is Be thou very lying (K) and 
cunning, (TA,) O Saad (K) the blacksmith: (TA:) 
and this explanation, says IB, is good, 
except inasmuch as that the 3 in u 3 J 3 thus derived 
should be with fet-h; or, he adds, it may be with 
damm to assimilate it to the 3 in » 3 [like as l^II is 
terminated with kesr to assimilate it to ujj 3 ]. 
(TA.) Or the origin of the saying was this: Saad 
the blacksmith was a Persian, who went about 
the districts of ElYemen, working for the people; 
and when he became without work in a district, 
he used to say, in Persian, jjj 33 » 3 : [so in a copy of 
the S; and this, or jjj 33 » 3 , is the correct 
reading: in another copy of the S, jjj 33 » 3 : and in 
the copies of the K, 3 jj 33 » 3 :] (S, K:*) meaning, [O 
town, or village,] farewell: to acquaint them that 
he was going forth on the morrow: (K:) or 
meaning I am going forth to-morrow: (S:) in 
order that he might be employed: and 

they arabicized the expression, and made him the 
subject of a prov. with respect to lying; and said, 
When ye hear of the blacksmith’s departure at 
night, he is assuredly coming in the morning. (S, 
K.) Some say that the prov. is elliptical, for J ^ 3 
jll jLj Jja [False is the saying of Saad &c.]. (TA.)

[right or approved] limit; (S;) or denoting low, or 
mean, estimation or condition; (Lth, T, M;) or a 
condition lower, baser, viler, &c., than that of 
another, in grounds of pretension to respect or 
honour [or in any approvable quality]; (Lth, T;)

highness, or eminence, of rank or condition, or 
in nobility; (T;) [and hence, exceeding another,

significations. (K.) You say, A jj 4 j 

meaning Zeyd is [below thee, or] in a condition 
lower, baser, viler, &c., than thine, in grounds of 
pretension to respect or honour [&c.]: and when

in rank or condition,” or “ is noble,” another 
replies, ■SL gjj j meaning And above that. (T.) — 

— Also Beneath, below in situation, or under; 
syn. caAi. (t, TA.) Using it in this sense, you 
say, <^jA -A <A>ja yA [May the cheek of thine 
enemy be beneath thy foot]: (T, TA:) and A jj gJi.

respect of place, or in front: and [the contr.,

3I3I jjj Uua [There is no poor-rate to be 
exacted in the case of what is other than, or

as a subst. (M, TA) with 0 -? prefixed to it, 
[very often in this case, in the Kur and elsewhere, 
as meaning jf- and sometimes in other senses 
explained above,] and likewise with ^ (M, K, TA,) 
though rarely. (K.) One says, ^ j- 3 li* and ^ 
[This is below thee, or above thee: &c.]. (M, 
TA.) And it is said in the Kur [xxviii. 23], 

(m, TA) And he found in a 
place below them two women: (Bd:) or beside 
them, or exclusively of them. (Jel.) One says 
also, I- 3 * or ^hj- 3 [meaning This belongs 

to me exclusively of thee]; i. e. thou hast no right 
nor share [with me] in this. (Kull p. 186.) The 
phrase 30 3 o* [app. as meaning 

Among whom was such as was not below him in 
respect of knowledge of poetry] is used by Akh in 
his book on rhymes. (M, TA.) — — It also 
denotes a command, (T, K,) and an incitement 
(Fr, T, S, K) to do a thing. (S.) Using it in the 
former sense, you say, 3* j:JI tib jJ, meaning Take 
thou the dirhem; (T;) or and ^ 

meaning Take thou the thing: (M:) and 
using it in the latter sense, you say, <^3, (S, 
K, TA,) meaning Keep thou, cleave thou, cling 
thou, or hold thou fast, to him; and take care of 
him: (TA:) or lijj ^ Keep thou, & c., to 
Zeyd, taking care of him. (T.) Temeem [meaning 
a party of the tribe so named] said to El-Hajjaj, 
when he had slain, i. e. crucified, Salih Ibn-’ Abd- 
Er-Rahman, “ Permit us to bury Salih: ” and he 

replied, » j- [Take ye him]. (S, TA.) And 

it also denotes a threat. (T, K.) So in 
the sayings ^j- 3 [Beware thou of wrestling 

with me] and ^ [Beware thou, and 

then set thyself against me to do evil if thou 

canst]. (T, TA.) It is said that no verb is 

derived from it: (T, S, M, Msb:) but some assert 

, i 

that u' J and [mentioned in the first paragraph 

of this art.] are derived from it. (S.) The 

dim. of Oj-i is J, 6 ) 3 : (Ham p. 404:) and J,

poet; but, [ISd says,] of what word I know not, 
unless they said { [for uj- 3 ]. (M.) 3 j- 3 : see the 
next preceding sentence, ihj ^ see the next

is substituted for one of the j s ; as is shown by its 
pi., (S, Msb,) which is jJjl j- 3 ; (S, M, Msb, K;) for if 


the lS were radical, they would say ujjU 3 ; (S;) but 
accord, to IDrd and IJ, (IB, TA,) it has this 
latter pi. also: (M, IB, K, TA:) Sb says that the j 
in tjjil, though after lS, is not changed into lS, as 
it is in 3 -, because the i_s in the former word is 
not inherent; that word being of the measure J-*s, 
from ^lij- 3 ; (M;) [i. e.] it is from uj- 3 meaning 
“ he collected the writings; ” as is shown by their 
saying J, ujjjj- 3 , (M,) which is the dim.: (Msb:) 
ISk says that u 1 is with kesr only [to the J]; 
(M;) but one says J, u^- 3 also, (K,) which is 
mentioned by Ks, as postclassical, and by Sb; 
like (M:) the meaning is A [or register]: 
(Shifa el-Ghaleel, TA:) or a collection of written 
leaves or papers [forming a book, generally for 
registration]: (ISk, M, Mgh, * K:) or a register of 
accounts; an accountbook: (Msb:) and a register 
of soldiers and pensioners [and others]: (IAth, 
K:) the first who instituted, or appointed, or 
arranged, such a book, (Mgh, Msb, K,) among the 
Arabs, (Msb,) for the prefects, or administrators, 
(Mgh, Msb,) and the Kadees, (Mgh,) is said to 
have been 'Omar: (Mgh, Msb, K: *) accord, to El- 
Mawardee, it is a register of what concerns the 
rights, or dues, of the state, relating to the acts of 
the government, and the finances, and the 
military and other administrators thereof: (TA:) 
then any book was thus called: and especially the 
poetry of some particular poet: so that this 
meaning became [conventionally regarded as] a 
proper signification thereof; (Shifa el-Ghaleel, 
TA;) i. e. a collection of poetry [of a particular 
poet]. (TA.) [Hence,] one says, gl 3 ^ 3*1 l>? u^, 
meaning Such a one is of those whose names 
are written in the register. (Mgh.) [Also Such a 
one is of the keepers of the register; or, is of the 
registrars. (And sometimes it has 
another meaning, which see below.) And hence 
the saying] yjUl jI3jj jiill (assumed tropical:)

of the u 1 ji- 3 [properly so called] refer to their u 1 
in a case that is doubtful to them; or because it 
was the depository of their sciences, and the 
preserver of their rules of discipline, and the 
mine of their histories. (Har p. 263.) — — 
Afterwards, also, it was applied to signify An 

account, or a reckoning. (Msb, TA.) And

or (Katadeh, T;) for his punishment 

according to him was beating, and a fine of 
twice the value of the thing stolen; not 
enslavement: (Jel:) or, accord, to ElUmawee, the 

meaning is, in the dominion of the King. (T.) 

[A system of usages, or rites and ceremonies &c., 
inherited from a series of ancestors.] It is said in 
a trad., of the Prophet, <-?ja u^“, meaning 

He used to conform with the old usages obtaining 
among his people, inherited from Abraham and 
Ishmael, in respect of their pilgrimage and their 
marriagecustoms (LAth, K, TA) and 

their inheritances (IAth, TA) and their modes of 
buying and selling and their ways of acting, 
(IAth, K, TA,) and other ordinances of the faith 
[&c.]; (IAth, TA;) but as to the belief in the unity 
of God, they had altered it; and the Prophet held 
no other belief than it: (IAth, K, TA:) or, as some 
say, the meaning here is, their dispositions, in 
respect of generosity and courage; from in the 
sense next following. (TA.) — — Custom, or 
habit; (AZ, T, S, M, K;) as also J. <A^: (M, * TA:) 
and business: (S, TA:) pi., as above, (M, TA.) 
This, also, has been said to be the primary 
signification. (TA.) One says, .iili Jl j li That 
has not ceased to be my custom, or habit. (T, TA.) 

A way, course, mode, or manner, of acting, 

or conduct, or the like. (K.) I. q. [app. 

as meaning Management, conduct, or regulation, 

of affairs]. (K.) State, condition, or case. (S, 

M, K.) ISh says, I asked an Arab of the desert 
respecting a thing, and he said to me, Jc. j! 
4ti jA.V To, jjfc [Hadst thou found me in a state 

other than this, I had informed thee]. (S, M.) 

A property, such as is an unknown cause of a 
known effect; syn. AAaL, (KL. [The significations 
of “ Via ” and “ Signum ” and “ Opera,” 
mentioned by Golius as from the KL, I do not 
find in my copy of that work.]) — Disobedience. 
(S, K.) [Thus it bears a signification the contr. of 
that first mentioned in this paragraph.] — 
Repayment, requital, compensation, or 
recompense: (S, M, K:) or, as some say, such as is 
proportioned to the deed of him who is its object. 
(TA.) Hence, An i- e. [The King] of 
the day of requital, in the Kur [i. 3]: (M, T, TA:) 
or the meaning in this instance is the next but 
one of those here following. (T, TA.) — — 
Retaliation, by slaying for slaying, or wounding 
for wounding, or mutilating for mutilating. (TA.) 

A reckoning. (T, S, M, K.) [See the sentence 

next but one above.] Hence, in the Kur [ix. 
36], [i s said to mean] That is the 


right, correct, or true, reckoning. (T, TA.) — 
Compulsion against the will: (K:) subdual, 
subjection, or subjugation; ascendency: 
sovereign, or ruling, power; or power 
of dominion: (S, K:) mastership, or ownership; or 
the exercise, or possession, of authority. (K, TA.) 
— A disease: (Lh, IAar, T, S, M, K:) or, accord, to 
El-Mufaddal, an old disease. (IAar, T.) — [It 
is said to signify also] A constant, or a gentle, 
rain; as also [ <“<: (K:) accord, to the book of Lth, 
[by which is meant the ’Eyn,] (T,) rain that has 
been constantly, (T,) or usually, (K,) recurring in 
a place: (T, K:) but this is a mistake of Lth, or of 
some one who has added it in his book: a verse of 
Et- Tirimmah, there cited as an ex., ends 
with oiij, which is in that instance syn. 
with uj j >, meaning “ moistened; ” its j being the 
primal radical, not the conjunction j; and 
as meaning any kind of rain being unknown. (T, 
TA.) — See also <“-, (so in the TT, as from 
the T,) or j <^j), with kesr, (so in the TA,) A cause 
of death. (T, TA.) <“-: see La- 3 , in five places: — 
and in three places: — and <-y< up Religious; 
or one who makes himself a servant of God; (S, 
Msb;) as also j (S.) A requiter, (S, M, 
K,) who neglects not any deed, but requites it, 
with good and with evil; (K, TA;) in this sense, 
with the article Jl, applied as an epithet to God: 
(S, M, TA:) a subduer; (T, K;) applied to a man 
in this sense; (T;) and also, in the same sense, 
with the article J, to God: (TA:) a judge; a ruler, 
or governor; (T, K;) in these senses, likewise, 
applied to a man; and, with the article J', to God: 
(T:) a manager, a conducter, or an orderer, (S, M,

K,) or J, oji^, (S, TA,) one much in debt: (S, M, K, 
TA:) and J, u 1 - 3 *, constantly in debt: (Sh, T:) 
and signifies one who takes, or receives, a 
loan, or the like; who borrows; or who takes, or 
receives, or buys, upon credit: (Sh, T, Msb:) and 
also one who repays a debt: (Sh, T, TA:) thus 
bearing two contr. meanings: (TA:) or also one 
who gives, or grants, credit; or sells upon credit:

The ninth letter of the alphabet; called eft it is 
one of the letters termed [or vocal, i. e. 

pronounced with the voice, and not with the 
breath only]: and of the letters termed [or 
gingival], which are 3 and 4 and wherefore it is 
substituted for 3 in for and it is said to 
be substituted for the unpointed J in fjj iyii, 
[as some read] in the Kur [viii. 59, for ^ -3^]. 
(TA.) — [As a numeral, it denotes Seven 

hundred.] 3 I- is said by Aboo-'Alee to 
be originally (3; the lS, though quiescent, being 
changed into k (M:) or it is originally or yj 4 ; 
the final radical letter being elided: some say that 
the original medial radical letter is lS because it 
has been heard to be pronounced with imaleh 
[and so it is now pronounced in Egypt]; but 
others say that it is j, and this is the more 
agreeable with analogy. (Msb.) It is a noun of 
indication, [properly meaning This, 
but sometimes, when repeated, better rendered 
that,] relating to an object of the masc. gender, 
(S, M, K,) such as is near: (I'Ak p. 36:) or 
it relates to what is distant [accord, to some, and 
therefore should always be rendered that]; 
and [which see in what follows,] to what 
is near: (K in art. 1* : [but the former is generally 
held to relate to what is near, like the latter:]) or 
it is a noun denoting anything indicated that is 
seen by the speaker and the person addressed: 
the noun in it is 4 , or j alone: and it is a noun of 
which the signification is vague and unknown 
until it is explained by what follows it, as when 
you say 333 3 [This man], and 3*13 li [This 
horse]: and the nom. and accus. and gen. are all 
alike: (T:) the fern, is l s? (T, S, M, K, but omitted 
in the CK) and »), (S, M, K, but omitted in the 
CK,) the latter used in the case of a pause, (S,) 
with a quiescent », which is a substitute for the lS, 
not a sign of the fern, gender, (S, M,) as it is 
in ksJk and » 3=s in which it is changed into » 
when followed by a conjunctive alif, for in this 
case the » in remains unchanged [but is 
meksoorah, as it is also in other cases of 
connexion with a following word]; and one says 
also (M;) and 3 and A (S and K &c. in 
art. 3) for the dual you say y3 and y3 (M;) y3 is 


the dual form of I j (T, S) [and CP is that of 3 used 
in the place of y 4 ]; i. e., you indicate the masc. 
dual by 3 j in the nom. case, and 33 in the accus. 
and gen.; and the fem. dual you indicate by tfe in 
the nom. case, and Cp in the accus. and gen.: 
(I'Ak p. 36:) the pi. is [or ?3] (T, S, and I'Ak 
ib.) in the dial, of the people of El-Hijaz, (I'Ak,) 
and 3 ji [or 3] (T, I'Ak) in the dial, of Temeem; 
each both masc. and fem. (I'Ak ib. [See art. Jk]) 
You say, 3A [This is thy brother]: and 
[This is thy sister]: (T:) and -3311 yj 3 yiuN [I 
will not come to thee in this year]; like as 
yousay 5 -*^! 3and-3Ul y 44 3;notAJI I- 3, 
because ^ is always masc. (As, T.) And you 
say, yli [These two are thy two 

brothers]: and ^*1 y3 [These two are thy two 
sisters]. (T.) And Aji.1 J [These are thy 
brothers]: and ^31 cV jl [These are thy sisters]: 
thus making no difference between the masc. and 

the fem. in the pi. (T.) The & that is used to 

give notice, to a person addressed, of something 
about to be said to him, is prefixed to I- [and 
to y) &c.], (T, S, M, K,) and is a particle without 
any meaning hut inception: (T:) thus you say I 44 , 
(T, S, M,) and some say Hi*, adding another I; 
(Ks, T;) fem. y-3 (x, S, M,) and [more 
commonly] in the case of a pause, (M,) and 

in other cases, (T, S,) and kiU, and some say 
but this is unusual and disapproved: (T:) 
dual y 1 ^ 4 for the masc., and lA 4 for the fem.; (T;) 
said by IJ to be not properly duals, but nouns 
formed to denote duals; (M;) and many of the 
Arabs say 3 A (T;) some, also, make yl3 indecl., 
like the sing. I j, reading [in the Kur xx. 66] y |44 yj 
3 [Verily these two are enchanters], and it 
has been said that this is of the dial, of Belharith 
[or Benu-l-Harith] Ibn-Kaab; but others make it 
deck, reading ylj^UJ 3) 44 yj: (S, TA: [see, 
however, what has been said respecting this 
phrase voce yj:]) the pi. is in the dial, of 
Temeem, with a quiescent k and Pi j 4 in the dial, 
of the people of El-Hijaz, with medd and hemz 
and khafd; and Pip in the dial, of Benoo- 'Okeyl, 
with medd and hemz and tenween. (AZ, T.) The 
Arabs also say, Al U V, introducing the name of 
God between I 4 and 3 meaning No, by God; this 


is [my oath, or] that by which I swear. (T.) In the 
following verse, of Jemeel, 13 3A <Aj 

UlLi.3 Ujjfe Aii yill [it is said that] I 44 is 

for W, (M,) i. e., » is here substituted for the 
interrogative hemzeh (S * and K in art. I 4 ) [so 
that the meaning is, And her female companions 
came, and said, Is this he who gave love to other 
than us, and treated us unkindly?]: or, as 
some assert, l^ 4 is here used for 13, the I being 
suppressed for the sake of the measure. (El-Bedr 

El-Karafee, TA in art. I 4 .) One says also ^3 

(T, S, M, K,) affixing to the ^ of allocution, [q. 
v., meaning That,] relating to an object that is 
distant, (T, *, S, and I'Ak p. 36,) or, accord, to 
general opinion, to that which occupies a middle 
place between the near and the distant, (I'Ak pp. 
36 and 37,) and this ^ has no place in desinential 
syntax; (S, and I'Ak p. 36;) it does not occupy the 
place of a gen. nor of an accus., but is only affixed 
to 1 4 to denote the distance of 1 4 from the person 
addressed: (T:) for the fem. you say As (T, S) 
and ^3 (S and K in art. 3 q. v.;) but not 33 for 
this is wrong, (T, S,) and is used only by the 
vulgar: (T:) for the dual you say 31 i (T, S) 
and 33 as in the phrases A 1 - 33 

l 33A [Those two men came to me] and 3 3 

yjAyll, [I saw those two men]; (S;) and some 
say >33 with teshdeed, (T, S,) [accord, to J] for 
the purpose of corroboration, and to add to the 
letters of the noun, (S,) but [accord, to others] 
this is dual of [which see in what follows,] the 
second y being a substitute for the J; (T on the 
authority of Zj and others;) and some say 
also, with tesh-deed, (T, S,) as well as (T in 
this art., and S and K in art. but there 
omitted in some copies of the S:) the pi. is [^W 3 
and] ji. (T, S.) 3 is also prefixed to ^3 so that 
you say, [That is Zeyd]: (S, TA:) and in 

like manner, for the fem., you say ■43 4 and ■iiljU; 
(S and K in art. 3) but it is not prefixed [to the 

dual nor] to ^ jk (S.) You also add J in ^3 

(T, S, M, K,) as a corroborative; (TA;) so that you 
say *^3, [meaning That,] (T, S, M, K,) relating to 
an object that is distant, by common consent; 
(I'Ak pp. 36 and 37;) or hemzeh, saying ^3 (K>) 
but some say that this is a mispronunciation: (TA

in art. lS j *:) for the fem. you say M and 'blM the 
dual of Mi is j, mentioned above; and that of 
the fem. is MU: (T: [and in the K in art. p is 
also mentioned as a dual, as well as a sing.:]) and 
the pi. is jl. (S and M and K voce J j' or Jl 
or Vl. [See art. I* ([.Jl is not prefixed to Mb (S) 
nor to « 21 c [nor to _s'] because, as IB says, the J 
denotes the remoteness of that which is indicated 
and the 1* denotes its nearness, so that the two 
are incompatible. (TA in art. M) — — In the 
saying in the Kur [ii. 256, the Verse of the 
Throne], ML VI »iM *-M ^ilt li (T, TA,) 
accord, to Th and Mbr, (TA,) li* is syn. with li [so 
that the meaning is, Who is this that shall 
intercede with Him but by his permission?]: (T, 
TA:) or it may be here redundant [so that the 

meaning is, Who is he that &c.?]. (Kull.) It 

is sometimes syn. with lM'. (T, S, M.) So in the 
saying, Ml j I j L> [What is it that thou sawest?]; to 
which one may answer, lM [A 

goodly commodity]. (Sb, S.) And so in the Kur [ii. 
216], OjM li U li MjIILj 3 [And they ask thee 
what amount of their property is it that they shall 
expend in alms]; (T, M, TA;) accord, to those who 
make the reply to be in the nom. case; for this 
shows that L> is [virtually] in the nom. case as an 
inchoative, and b is its enunciative, and OjM is 
the complement of b; and that L> and b are not to 
be regarded as one word: [or] this is the 
preferable way of explanation in the opinion of 
Sh, though he allowed the other way, [that of 
regarding L> and b as one word, together 
constituting an inchoative, and ujM as 
its enunciative, (see Ham p. 521,)] with [the reply 
in] the nom. case: (M:) and li*, also, is used in 
the same sense: (TA:) so too b in j* b U and b ji 
3* may he considered as syn. with lM'; hut it is 

preferable to regard it as redundant. (Kull.) 

It is [said to be] redundant also in other 
instances: for ex., in the trad, of Jereer, as related 
by Aboo-'Amr Ez-Zahid, who says that it is so in 
this instance: Jb= lM l s* a? 34 j 

Ml iji ML* [There will come to you a man 
from El-Yemen, having upon his face an 
indication of dominion]. (TA. [But this evidently 
belongs to art. ji; in which see a similar ex. ( Mi 

lM b). See also other exs. there.]) [M lit. 

means Like this: and hence, thus: as also li£*. _ 
— It is also often used as one word, and, as such, 
is made the complement of a prefixed noun; as 
in li£ ML a nd li£ M*> in such a year. See also 
art. Ii£; and see the letter M] — — Ii* is 
sometimes used to express contempt, and 
mean estimation; as in the saying of 'Aisheh 
respecting 'Abd-Allah Ibn- 'Amr Ibn- Abbas, 4 
li* jjie j)') GLL [o wonder (meaning how I 


L 

wonder) at Ibn-'Amr, this fellow!]. (Kitab el- 
Miftah, cited in De Sacy's “ Gram. Ar.,” 2nd ed., i. 
442.) [lb* 4 often occurs as addressed to one who 
is held in mean estimation: it is like the Greek to 
oLto^, and virtually like the vulgar Arabic 
expression M U, and the Latin heus tu; agreeably 
with which it may he rendered O thou; meaning 

0 thou fellow; an appellation denoting mean 
estimation being understood: in the contrary 
case, one says Js 4 . See also, in what follows, a 

usage of bib and bib. Ii* in a letter and the 

like is introduced when the writer breaks off, 
turning to a new subject; and means “ This is 
all that I had to say on the subject to which, it 
relates: ” what follows it is commenced with the 

conjunction j.] One says, bllb Mi [and 3 M 

bill], meaning It is not approved: for, [like as a 
person held in mean estimation is indicated 
by b>*, which denotes a thing that is near, so,] on 
account of its high degree of estimation, a thing 
that is approved is indicated by that whereby one 
indicates a thing that is remote. (Kull voce oM.) 

[See also what next follows.] M*P bib i n the 

Kur ii. 1 is said by Zj to mean MM! I li* [This 
book]: but others say that bib is here used 
because the book is remote [from others] in 
respect of highness and greatness of rank. (TA.) 

blliS [lit. Like that, often means so, or in like 

manner: and ] Let that suffice [thee or] you. 

(TA in art. from a trad.) The dim. of b 

is bb : (T, S, M:) you form no dim. of the fem. 
using in its stead that of b, (S,) which is IS; (T:) 
the dim. of the dual [Ji] is JM (S:) and that of 
[the pi.] »Vjl [and Jj] is [and jj]: (T:) - 

— that of lb* is bb, like that of lb; [and you 
may say bb* also; for] that of M j* is 4 Lly*: (T:) — 

— that of bllb is bibb; (s, K: *) and that of bib is bllS : 

(K in art. M) that of bllb is bllbi : (s, K: *) and 

that of bill is blllb. (S.) A rajiz says, Mj jl 
JM 1 I ibllbb Jl ,jjJ JIMI [Or thou shalt swear by 
thy Lord, the High, that I am the father of that

because his motions are of the like description:

iA ji and 1 (K,) and A jj 3 1 — 

(S, Msb, K,) in which the last word is in the accus. 
case as an explicative, for the original form of the 
phrase is that first mentioned, (TA,) and 
sometimes they said j A lj j, (s, TA,) (tropical:) 
He was unable to do, or accomplish, the thing, or 


affair; as though meaning, he stretched forth his 
arm to it and it did not reach it; (S, TA; *) or 
these phrases are thus used because he who is 
short in the fore arm will not reach that which he 
who is long therein reaches, nor will the power of 
the former equal that of the latter; therefore they 
are proverbially applied to him whose power falls 
short of the attainment, or accomplishment, of an 
affair: (TA:) or he lacked strength, or power, or 
ability, to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair, 
and found not any way of escape from what 
was disagreeable therein: (K:) or he was unable 
to bear, or endure, or undertake, the thing, or

mind, carry thee beyond thy measure or extent 
[of power or ability]. (TA.) And **■ jp lHa Aijlul 
(tropical:) I imposed upon such a one more than 
he was able to do: (S, TA:) but £ jp also signifies 
(assumed tropical:) the body: and [accord, to 
IAar] J- 1 means (tropical:) He wasted 

my body, and cut off my means of subsistence. 
(TA.) [See also art. jAj.] You likewise say, 31 j 
1 mAj [and £jAI] (tropical:) A man 

having ample strength, and power, and might in 
war or fight, courage, valour, or prowess. (TA. 
[See also A1I3.]) And £jAI ^ «.:» - >» (tropical:) 

Impotent. (KL.) And hence, £ jAI Jll jili 

(tropical:) Such a one has his heart devoid of 
anxieties, or solicitudes, and griefs; because the 
heart is sometimes one of the seats of power: or it 
may mean, agreeably with the original 
signification of £ jp, such a one is free from the 
causes of occupation which require the stretching 
forth of the fore arm and extending of the hand.

to hang out from among the branches and 
prickles, so that the fruit is easily plucked when it 
ripens. (T. [See also 3133.]) [Hence it is said in the

former, as has been stated above:] Er-Raghib 
says that 1 3311 is a consequence of subjection; 
and 3311 is what is after refractoriness: so that the

tractable, or submissive, to them. (TA.) — Also 
The beaten track, (K,) or part that is trodden and

this is the meaning in the saying, A3i

— AJi is sometimes used as a noun independent 
in its meaning, (Mgh, Msb,) so as to denote 
material [or real] things; (Msb;) and is described 
by the epithets » [or “ distinct ”] (Mgh, Msb) 
and <4p [as meaning “ that has existed 
from eternity ”] (Mgh) and <jAJ> [as meaning “ 
that has been brought into existence ”]. (Mgh, 
Msb.) Thus used, (Msb,) it signifies The essence 
of a thing, meaning that by being which a thing is 
what it is, or that in being which a thing consists; 
or the ultimate and radical constituent of a thing: 
and the essence as meaning the peculiar nature 
of a thing: syn. <P=< (T, IB, Msb, TA,) and 
(Msb,) and <PP (t, ib, TA:) it is also used as 
meaning a thing's self: (Mgh, * Msb:) [a man's 
self, or person: (see - :)] and a thing; a being; 
anything, whatever it be; every sJP being a A3i ; 
and every A3i being a (Aboo-Sa'eed, 

Mgh, Msb:) and particularly a substance, or thing 
that subsists by itself: [hence pi 4“! meaning a 
real substantive; also termed gP fP: 
opposed to P*-* 4P> i. e. an ideal substantive:] 
and [hence] it signifies also a word that is 
independent in its meaning; [i. e. A3i (alone), 
though oftener used in the sense assigned above 
to c>h 4P, signifies also, absolutely, a 
substantive;] opposed to <P= as signifying a word 
that is not independent in its meaning. (Kull p. 
187.) Its application to God, in the sense of <4P- 
and <PlA, is forbidden by most persons: 
(TA:) [for] <UI c3i [as meaning The essence of 
God], used by the scholastic theologians, is said 
to be an ignorant expression, because the names 
of God do not admit the fem. affix »; so that one 
does not apply to Him the epithet <*ip though 
He is the all-surpassing in knowledge. (Msb.) 
The phrase <M c3i p is like <31 aP P [in, or in 
respect of, that which is the right, or due, of God; 
or in, or in respect of, obedience to God, or the 
means of obtaining nearness to God, or the way 
of God]: and like <Ul <4jl [for the sake of God; or 
to obtain the countenance, or favour, or 
approbation, or recompense, of God]: (Msb:) or it 
means in obedience to God; and in the way of 
God or his religion: (TA:) [or it may be rendered 
for the sake of God Himself; and so <U' <4jl: it is 
said to have been used by the Arabs [of the 
classical age], as well as by Aboo-Temmam, [who 
was a Muwelled;] (Mgh, Msb, *) but some deny 
that it occurs in the old language. (Msb. [See, 
however, an ex. from a trad, voce gAp'.]) [It is 
said that] the phrase <141 A3i 4PP , used by En- 
Nabighah, (Msb,) i. e. EdhDhubyanee, (TA in 
art. J?-,) means Their book is the service of God 


Himself: (Msb:) [but it seems more reasonable 
to render this phrase agreeably with the primary 
signification of a3ji as meaning their book is that 
of God, in a sense like that in which a house of 
worship is said to be a house of God; for,] as 
some relate it, the phrase used by En-Nabighah 
is A3i 4$AAi, with <P, [i. e. their abode is in a 
peculiar manner that of God,] meaning, their 
abode is one of pilgrimage and of sacred sites. (S 
and TA in art. <_P.) — — j- is sometimes 
redundant [in respect of meaning, though 
governing as a prefixed n.]; and so is its pi. (T, * 
TA.) Az says, (TA,) I have heard more than one of 
the Arabs say, jjP gi jA 'P P, i. e. We 

were in such a place with Amr: (T, TA:) and glS 
jjP ji lAi, i. e. 'Amr was with us: and g-0 li 139, 
meaning 0-P P' [We came to El-Yemen]. (T.) 
[See an ex. similar to this last, and evidently 
belonging to the present art., in the latter half of 
art. li. And see 4 P 4 Y and 4P ^ J 4 and li ip 4 
434 and 3?- li 4 (in which li is in like 
manner redundant, as are also gl and ip, the 
latter of which is a dial. var. of the former of 
them,) in art. ?py. perhaps belonging to the 
present art., like gpi 133; or perhaps to art. 14 
See also what is said respecting ji prefixed to a 
proper name in an early portion of 

this paragraph.] It is also used in the sense 

of g3i, (T, S, M, K,) in the dial, of Teiyi, (T, S, 
TA,) for the purpose of qualifying a determinate 
noun (S, M, K) by means of a proposition which 
it connects with that noun: (M, K:) and when 
thus used, it [generally] retains the same form 
when it denotes a dual and a pi. (S, M, K) and a 
fem., (S,) and exhibits no sign of case: (M, K:) 
you say, A3j3 ji 13 [1 who knew], and aAw, ji 
[who heard]; and P cili p i\ jill [This is the 

woman who said such a thing: (S:) and J13 ji plil 
cili [He who said that came to me]; and 413 p 
Alii [They two who said that came to me]; and 
311i I jH3 ji [They who said that came to me]. (M.) 
But Fr says, I heard an Arab of the desert 
say, 14^ <111 ^A-o3^i A,li Aalj31lj p <111 ,A. ’Ae ji .J ^ ■ 
[By the excellence wherewith God hath made you 
to excel, and the honour wherewith God hath 
honoured you]; thus they use AjIj ; n the place 
of lA and they make it to be with refa in every 
case: and they confuse [numbers and genders] in 
speaking of a dual number and a pi. number [and 
a fem.]; they sometimes say, [for ex.,] in the case 
of the dual, p jlii and ji [These 
two whom, or which, thou knowest]; and a poet 
says, [namely, Sinan Ibn-El-Fahl, of the tribe 
of Teiyi, (Ham p. 292,)] ji lS jpj iS-P-j ^ jla 
c3jA jij Ci jA. [For verily the water is the water

Accord, to the usage most in repute, j 4 in this 
sense is indecl., and has no variation of gender or 
number; but some decline it, like jj in the sense 
of i . except that they make cjlj

saying and in every case, if they adopt 
the chaste mode; otherwise, in the accus. and

of sight cannot be attributed to God: (TA:) [and 
similar to this is the phrase, 1*4 J l s' j He saw in

experienced from him such a thing.] Secondly, 
The seeing by supposition, or fancy; as in the 
saying, cjii l*jj <J ^y [1 suppose, or fancy, that 
Zeyd is going away]. (TA.) Thirdly, The seeing by 
reflection, or consideration; as in the saying [in 
the Kur viii. 50 ], u33* V L* ls ’J' <Jj [Verily I see by 
reflection, or consideration, what ye see not]. 
(TA.) Fourthly, The seeing with the mind, or 
mentally; [the opining, or judging, a thing; 
a sense in which the inf. n. o!j is more commonly 
used;] (M, * K, * TA;) as in the saying in the Kur 
[liii. 11 ], ob * jl m* 4 U [The heart did not 
belie what he mentally saw]. (TA.) [Of these 
meanings, other exs. here follow; with exs. of 
similar meanings.] — — An ex. of 0 for lS( 3

first foot reduced to ujl*ii], (M.) <j ^4*"JI, 
for J jj, altered in the manner explained above, 
[meaning Praise be to God for the seeing of thee,] 
(M, K, *) is a saying mentioned by IAar. 
(M.) <4 j j] 1 j*- 3 means [Fast ye] at the time of 
seeing it; [referring to the new moon of 
Ramadan;] i. e., when ye see it. (Mgh.) In the 
phrase LJ J 3 [1 saw him standing], is in 
the accus. case as a denotative of state. 
(Msb.) ^t* 4** 14 3 J4 ob [My eye saw (lit. my 
eye's seeing) Zeyd do that] is held by Sb to be an 
instance of an anomalous use of an inf. n., and is 
[said to be] the only instance of the kind, among 
inf. ns. of trans. verbs except J*' (M, TA: but 

in a copy of the former written J** lS'j 
and u**ll il s'j 34b (.J*L *-»4 means [I saw him, or 
it,] where the eye, or sight, fell upon him, or it. 
(TA.) L* u*** [lit. With some eye I will

as meaning hasten thou, (iU! thus in copies of 


the S and in the TA, or ilU as in one copy of the 
S,) or work thou, (JJ thus in two copies of the 
S,) and be as though I were looking at thee: (S, 
TA:) it is said to one whom you send, and require 
to be quick; and means pause not for anything, 
for it is as though I were looking at thee. (TA in 
art. dJll Jiill csl3 (.ij -f- (tropical:) The place 
faced [or (as we say) looked upon] the place, as 
though seeing it, (M, TA,) is tropical: (TA:) [and 
in like manner you say,] ’O'* lS 3* is jl* 
(tropical:) My house faces [or looks upon] his 

house. (T, IAth, TA.) 4jj jO [He saw, 

i. e. fancied that he saw, in his sleep, a vision, or 

dream]. (S, Msb, K. *) 1*4 y p\ [Has thou 

not considered such a thing, so as to be 
admonished thereby?] is a phrase used on an 
occasion of wonder (IAth, K, TA) at a thing, and 
in rousing the attention of the person to whom it 
is addressed; as in the saying in the Kur [ii. 
244 ], j j 4* i> ' 0 j 4' J! 3* p [Hast thou 

not considered those who went forth from their 
houses, so as to be admonished by their case?]; 
meaning, hast thou not wondered at their act, 
and has not their case come to thy knowledge? 
and so in other instances in the same: (IAth, TA:) 
Er-Raghib says that, when -Jj i s made trans. by 
means of JJ, it denotes consideration that leads 
to the becoming admonished. (TA.) In like 
manner also, (IAth, K,) and LiSjjJ 

and (T, IAth, K,) and to a woman ‘44J, 

and to a pi. number of women CpQ J, (T,) [which 
may be lit. rendered Hast thou, and have ye two, 
& c., considered?] are expressions used to arouse 
attention, (IAth, TA,) meaning tell thou me and 
tell ye two me &c.; (T, IAth, K;) as in the saying in 
the Kur [xvii. 64 ], CiiJ cjl li* J15 

[He said, Hast thou considered? meaning tell me, 
respecting this whom Thou hast honoured above 
me]; and in the same [vi. 40 and 47 ], Ja 

<111 t_iljc jj [Say thou, Have ye considered? 
meaning tell me, if the punishment of God come 
upon you]; and occurring without the ^ in 
other places thereof: (IAth, TA:) you say 
also, 143 ■— 4'3' and 143 ^ 13 ', meaning Tell thou 
me [respecting Zeyd]: (Mgh:) and for CI 1 JI 3 I 
and ‘il4 l 3 l [&c.] some say Ji3 l and ^43: (S:) the 
pronunciation without * is the more common: 
the ^ in &c- is always with fet-h; and 

accord, to the grammarians of accredited science, 
the in these cases is redundant; (T;) [i. e.] it is a 
particle of allocution, to corroborate the pronoun 
[cj, which it therefore immediately follows in 
every case, distinguishing the genders and 
numbers by its own variations, which are the 
same as those of the pronominal affix of the 
second person]: (Bd in vi. 40 :) [IHsh says,] the 
correct opinion is that of Sb; that the cj is an

J 


[BOOKI.] 


agent, and the ^ is a particle of allocution: 
(Mughnee in art. 4 ) but sometimes jUjjljl &c. 
mean -Jl— jj ciyi j JJa &c.; the ^ being in this case an 
objective complement [and the verb being 
differently rendered according as it has not, or 
has, a second objective complement, as is shown 
here by what precedes and what follows]. (T.) 
In till jj', also, [from i Isy, not from cru,] 
meaning [i. e. Thinkest thou?], the 
pronoun [as some term it, but properly the final 
particle,] is [a particle of allocution] like that 
in ^£1 jl in the Kur vi. 40 and 47 [cited above; and 
in the same sense as this latter phrase, ‘Jlljjl 
is used, as meaning tell thou me]. (Har p. 570.) — 
— When ijl j means He knew, (S, Msb,) or he 
thought, (Msb,) it has two objective 
complements: (S, Msb:) or when it has two 
objective complements, it necessarily 
means knowing [or the like]. (Er-Raghib, TA.) [In 
this case, »' j may be rendered He saw, or knew, 
him, or it, to be: and he thought, or judged, or 
held, him, or it, to be; or he regarded, or held, 
him, or it, as.] You say, UJli. li) j c4j, (S, Msb, *) 
or Lyf*-, (M,) I knew [or saw Zeyd to be learned,

to be so with the eye: (M:) and I thought him 
[&c.] to be so. (Msb.) In like manner, also, 
1 <“* 1 jj signifies I thought him to be. (Har p. 
211.) jj*ll ijlj efrjfc ? pijjj*, in the Kur [iii. 11], 
means They [who were the unbelievers] thinking 
them [who were fighting in the cause of God] 
twice as many as they, according to the evidence 
of the sight of the eye. (TA.) The pass, form of ls' j 
has [only] one objective complement: 
you say, -4 j 'Jt j, meaning Zeyd was thought 

[to be intelligent]: (TA:) and »ljl lS^, with the 
verb in the pass, form, means [i. e. jL', He 
whom I am thought to be; if from 'Ji j: or 
what I think, if from 1 lsjI: it is often used in the 

latter sense]. (Msb.) You say also, J lsO

a persuasion, or a belief, respecting the affair, or

well, or righteously, (T,) in order to make others

intelligence (K, TA) and judgment and forecast: 
(TA:) inf. n. *tj). (K, TA. [The inf. n. is mentioned 
with this signification, in the K, app. because it is 
the first there explained, and therefore as 

applying to the verb in all its senses.]) And 

He had the appearance, or evidence, 
of foolishness, or stupidity, in his face: (T, K, TA: 
[the words by which Az explains this meaning 
are ^ j Jyljl aAj ; accord, to one 

copy of the T; in another copy of the same, »bjll;

correctly written, in art. I j'j; in the S, in the

proper art., and therefore the proper art. of the

two contr. meanings. (K. [But it is added in the 

TA that this requires consideration.]) Also 

He had what is termed a 3)3, of the jinn, or genii; 

(T, K, TA;) i. e., a follower, of the jinn. (TA.) 

And He followed the opinion, or belief, of some 
one, or more, of the lawyers (K, TA) in the 

science of the law. (TA.) AI3I said of a she- 

camel and of a ewe or she-goat, (M,) and of any 
female in a state of pregnancy, except a 
solidhoofed animal and a beast of prey, Her 
udder showed her to be pregnant: (M, K:) and in 
like manner it is said of a woman: (M:) or, said of 
a ewe or she-goat, she was, or became, big in her 
udder: (S:) and accord, to IAar, said of a she- 
goat, she was, or became, swollen in her vulva, 
and her being so became apparent, or evident. 
(M.) And lsO 1 said of a man, His ewe, or she-goat, 
was, or became, black in her udder. (T.) — See 
also 1, in two places, near the end of the

that l $< J, said of a camel, means “Aki. Aiiil

right, or just title or claim, to the possession of 
anything; or its [which is syn. with 3UU]; 

(M, A, K;) mj and 3llU and m>1 all signifying in 
Pers. 3jjl33 : (KL:) and a lord, master, or chief; 
(Msb, TA;) or a lord, master, or chief, to whom 
obedience is paid: (IAmb, TA:) and a lord, 
ruler, governor, regulator, or disposer; (TA;) an 
orderer, a rectifier, or a reformer: (IAmb, TA:) a 
rearer, fosterer, bringer-up, feeder, or nourisher: 
and a completer, or an accomplisher: (TA:) it is 
an epithet, like 4 from P: or an inf. n. used as an 
intensive epithet; like J33; (Ksh and Bd * in i. 1;) 
originally signifying the “ bringing (a thing) to a 
state of completion by degrees;” (Bd, ibid.;) then 
used in the sense of 3UU : (Ksh and Bd ibid.:) the 
pi. [of pauc.] is m 4 jl and [of mult.] m jo, (M, K,) 
and accord, to Sh, m4j also, (TA,) 
signifying mA=3-oI, (K,) and 1 mjo is app. a quasi- 
pl. n.: (M:) the fern, is i Pj; of which the pi. 
is 3 Aj3. (T.) Whoever possesses a thing is its mj: 
you say, 4 jIj1I mj > [He is the possessor, or 
owner, or master, of the beast], and j'311 [of the 
house], (T,) and JLJI [of the property, or cattle]; 
(Msb;) and ? j ^ ] cjull [She is the owner, or 
mistress, of the house or tent]. (T.) With the 
article Jl, it is [properly] applied only to God: (T, 
S, M, A, Msb, K:) He is m^j^I mj [The Lord of 
lords]. (T. [Thus the pi. with the article Jl is 
applied to created beings.]) To any other being it 
is not [properly] applied but as a prefixed 
noun governing another noun as its complement 
in the gen. case [or in a similar manner]. (S.) The 
pagan Arabs, however, sometimes applied it to A 
king, (S,) or to a lord as meaning a master or 
chief: (Msb:) El- Harith says, (S, Msb,) i. e. Ibn- 
Hillizeh, (S,) il>Lll j jj344' ^ jj ^ 4}$-mI j m 3" >3 
(S, Msb,) i. e. And he (meaning El-Mundhir 
Ibn-Ma-es-Sema, or, as some say, 'Amr Ibn- 
Hind,) was the king [or lord] and witness of our 
fighting on the day of El-Hiyaran (the name of a 


place), and the trial was a hard trial. (EM, p. 285: 
[in which 0)343" is erroneously put for 0)34*11.]) 
Some forbid that a man should be called the mj 
of his slave: (Msb:) it is said in a trad, that the 
slave shall not say to his master, Jij, because it is 
like attributing a partner to God: (TA:) but mj is 
sometimes used in the sense of lord as 
meaning master or chief prefixed to a noun 
signifying a rational being governed by it in the 
gen. case: thus in the saying of the Prophet, ,jj3 
4)3 5uVI 31) [So that the female slave shall bring 
forth him who will become her master], or 1 4-Sj 
[her mistress], accord. to different 
transmitters; (Msb;) relating to the signs of the 
hour of resurrection: i. e., the female slave shall 
bring forth to her master a child that shall be as 
a master [or mistress] to her because like his [or 
her] father in rank: meaning that captives and 
concubines shall be numerous. (TA.) As to 
the phrase in the Kur [xii. 42], 3£j it iMj^il 
[Mention thou me in the presence of thy lord], 
Joseph thus addressed his fellow- 
prisoner agreeably with the acceptation in which 
he [the latter] understood the words. (TA.) A 
similar instance also occurs in the same chapter, 
in the verse immediately preceding. (Msb.) In 
another verse, [23 of the same ch.,] ^3 41 [Verily 
he is my lord] may refer to Joseph's master or 
to God. (M, TA.) The words of the Kur [lxxxix. 28 
and 29], lsxp J3l4 Sm=I 3 3l)3 ls j m 3!, 
as some read, [instead of ls) 4?-,] may 
mean Return to thine owner, [approving, 
approved,] and enter into my servant. (M, TA.) — 
— Without the article Jl, as some say, (L, TA,) it 
is sometimes written and pronounced j m3, 
without teshdeed; (L, K;) as in the following 
verse, cited by El-Mufaddal, u-)) jl f'3^1 4° ^3 
JJ3)3 -kjliUl ^4*4 j* 34 Mj ja [And the 
peoples have known that there is not above him a 
lord beside Him who gives the portions of 
mankind and of others and grants the means of 
subsistence]. (L.) And Ahmad Ibn-Yahya [i. e. 
Th] mentions the phrase J*il V >31^33 X for 3lj33 ^ 
[i. e. No, by thy Lord, I will not do such a thing]; 
the [latter] m being changed into l s because of the 
reduplication. (M, K: * in the CK 3^3.) mj is a 
word of which there are seventy dial, vars., all 
mentioned by Zekereeya El-Ansaree in his great 
Expos, of the “ Munferijeh,” but only eighteen 
of which are mentioned in the K, including some 
that are formed with the affix some with the 
affix l-«, and some with both these 
affixes together; as follows: (TA:) m j (T, S, M,

are Aj and Aj: and] i Aj is the most common 
of the forms that have the affix (Mughnee and 
K on the letter A) and the forms with teshdeed 
are more common than the [corresponding] 
forms without teshdeed. (M.) It is a word, (M,) or 
particle, (T, S, Mughnee, K,) governing the gen. 
case: (S, M, Mughnee, K:) or a noun, (K, TA,) [i. 
e. an indecl. noun,] in the opinion of the Koofees 
and some others; but this opinion is rejected by 
Ibn-Malik in the Tesheel and its Expos., and by 
AHei, and by IHsh in the Mughnee. (TA.) Accord, 
to some, (K, TA,) it is used to denote a small 
number, (T, M, Msb, K, TA,) always, (TA,) 
or mostly: (Msb, TA:) [thus it may be rendered 
Few if we render the noun following it as a pi.; 
and scarce any if we render the noun following 
as a sing, or a pi.:] it is the contr. of A when this 
latter is not used interrogatively: (T:) [and with L 
affixed, restricting it from government, it may be 
rendered Few times, or seldom:] or it is used 
to denote a large number; (K, TA;) i. e. always: so 
says IDrst: (TA:) [thus used, but such is not 
always the case, it may be rendered Many, 
whether we render the noun following it as a 
sing, or as a pi.: and with L affixed, Many times, 
many a time, oftentimes, ofttimes, often, 
or frequently:] or it is used to denote a small and 
a large number; (Mughnee, K;) often the latter, 
and seldom the former: (Mughnee:) or it is used 
in a case of boasting, or glorying, (K, TA,) 
exclusively of other cases, (TA,) to denote a large 
number: (K, TA:) or it does not denote by itself 
either a small number or a large number; but one 
or the other of these meanings is inferred from 
the context: (K:) [but sometimes neither of these 
meanings can be clearly inferred from 
the context: in these cases, it may be rendered 
Some: and with L affixed, Sometimes:] accord, to 


Er-Radee, its primary meaning is to denote 
a small number, but it has been so much used to 
denote a large number as to be in this latter sense 
as though it were proper, and in the former sense 
as though it were tropical, requiring context [to 
explain it]. (Marginal note in my copy of the 
Mughnee.) [Without the affix A] it governs an 
indeterminate noun (T, * S, Msb, Mughnee, K) 
only, (T, S, K,) and a pronoun. (S, M, Mughnee.) 
You say, A ^ 3A eA Aj [Few, or many, days have 
I gone forth early therein]: (T:) and A Aj A j 
[Few, or many, men are standing]: (M:) and A j 
A Aj [Few, or many, men stood]: (Msb:) and in 
like manner, Aj j. Aj; (Msb;) for the cii in this 
case is not a denotative of the fern, gender. (Msb.) 
The pronoun affixed to it is of the third pers., (S, 
M,) and is [generally] sing, and masc., 
(S, Mughnee,) though it may be followed by a 
fern, and by a dual and by a pi.: (S:) 
notwithstanding its being determinate in the 
utmost degree, its use in this manner is allowable 
because it resembles an indeterminate noun in its 
being used without the previous mention of 
the noun to which it relates; and hence it requires 
a noun to explain it: (IJ, M:) it annuls the 
government of A j; (TA;) and the 
indeterminate noun that follows it is put in the 
accus. case as a specificative: (S, Mughnee:) thus 
you say, AA A Aj A) [Few, or many, men I 
have beaten]: (S, M: *) but accord, to the 
Koofees, you say Aj A ; (S,) and A jil Aj, (M,) 
and AAj AA, and A j <Aj, and Aj: he 
who puts the pronoun in the sing, [in all cases] 
holds it to be allusive to something unknown; 
and he who does not put it in the sing, [when it 
is not followed by a sing, noun] holds it to be 
used in reply to a question, as though it were said 
to a man, “Hast thou not any young women? ” 
and he answered, ALL ia jA Aj [Few, or 
many, young women have I possessed]: Ibn-Es- 
Sarraj says that the grammarians are as 
though they were of one consent in holding Aj to 
be a replicative [app. meaning in a case of this 
kind, with an affixed pronoun]: (S:) [but it is 
not always a replicative in a case of this kind; 
though perhaps it was originally:] AHeyth cites 
as an ex. f cj-Asi UA- “Ajj [And many 

a perishing man have I saved from perdition]. 
(TA. [But the reading commonly found in 
grammars is A u? from his state of perdition.]) 
The following is an ex. of the use of Aj to denote 
a small number, [or rather to denote 
singleness,] A A Aj A 1 A oAj ?jA Aj Yl 
u' A A [Now surely scarce an instance is there of 
anyone bom not having a father, and of anyone 
having offspring whom two parents have 
not procreated]; meaning [our Lord] Jesus and 


Adam: (Mughnee: [but I have substituted A 
for A, the reading in my copy of that work: A 
A is for A A, for the sake of the metre; like as f] 
A is for A p : ]) and among the many exs. of its 
use to denote a large number, is the saying, in a 
trad., 3-All fjj 3jjA A A A AA Aj 1) [O, many a 
female having clothing in the present state of 
existence will be naked on the day of 
resurrection!]; and the saying of an Arab of the 
desert, after the ending of Ramadan, A-“ = A j ^ 
Ajij jl A j b j A j! [O, many a keeper of 

its fast shall not keep its fast again! and O, 
many a passer of its nights in prayer, or per- 
former of its jjjI A, shall not pass its nights in 
prayer, or perform its jjjI A, again!]. (Mughnee.) 
[But in this last ex., and in others, it relates to few 
in comparison with others, though many 

abstractedly.] As affixed to Aj &c. in order 

that a verb may follow it; (S, Mughnee;) and the 
verb that follows it is generally a preterite, (T, 
Mughnee,) as to the letter and the meaning: 
(Mughnee:) you say, lA csAA Aj [Seldom, or 
often, such a one came to me, or has come to 
me]: (T:) sometimes the verb is a future; (T, 
Mughnee;) but only when it expresses an event of 
which one is certain: (T:) so in the saying in the 
Kur [xv. 2 ], I jAl j! I jjaS jjill A Aj, (T, S, 
M, Mughnee), meaning Often [will those 
who have disbelieved wish that they had been 
Muslims]; (Mughnee, Jel;) or seldom, (Zj, T, M, 
Jel,) because terrors will bereave them of 
their reason so that they will but seldom recover 
reason to wish this; (Jel;) for God’s threat is true, 
as though it had come to pass, and therefore the 
verb here is equivalent to a preterite [which is 
often used in the Kur and elsewhere in this 
manner]. (T.) is also sometimes affixed when a 
noun follows, (T, Mughnee,) or a nominal 
proposition, and generally restricts A j &c. from 
governing: thus, Aboo-Duwad says, ilWA Aj 
jAJI 3AS cj#?- l3cj fA A A 1 [Sometimes, or 
often, the numerous herd of camels is among 
them, and there are swift horses, among which 
are the colts]: another says, making Aj, with L 
affixed, to govern, A AA Aj-^ Aj 

cilAj ALA [Many a stroke with a polished sword 
of the forging of Busra, (the Bozrah of the Bible, a 
city famous for its sword-blades,) and many a 
wide spear-wound; or, perhaps, few strokes &c.]: 
(Mughnee: [but I have substituted jja for A, 
which is the reading in my copy of the Mughnee, 
an evident mistranscription:]) and another, cited 
by IAar, says, •'“jA d lAj U (jjL | SjA

(assumed tropical:) the vitious, or wicked, who 
speaks respecting the affairs of the community: A 
'Obeyd compares this trad, with another, in 
which it is said that one of the signs above 
mentioned will be, that the pastors of sheep or 
goats will be the heads of the people: and Az says 
that means the pastor of sheep or 

goats: some say that it means (assumed tropical:) 
he who abstains, or holds back, from seeking the 
means of acquiring eminence, or nobility; 


and »jI jll signifies [the same, or] impotent to 
attain eminence: in this latter, the » is added to 
give intensiveness to the signification: and Az 
thinks it most probable that each of these is 
applied to the mean man because of his 
remaining in his house, or tent, and seldom 
rising and going forth to occupy himself in great 
affairs. (TA.) <^4jj: see the next preceding

jfYI ££j: the word j«-“ is necessarily added in 
order to discriminate between the months thus 
called and the season called £*u: Az says, the 
Arabs mention all the months without the 
word except the two months of and the 
month of o'— “j: and they say also 
and and (Msb:) these 

months were thus called because, when they 
received this name, they occurred in the season 
when the earth produced herbage. (Msb in 
art. ^-.) It has a twofold application also to 
seasons; (JjYI jjjjII being The season in which the 
truffles and the blossoms come, (S, Msb, K,) and 
this is [also called] [the rabeea of the 

herbage, properly called the spring of Arabia]; 
(S;) and uj™ yjjll The season in which fruits 
ripen; (S, Msb, K;) [also called J-iSlI £Hj;] but 
some people call this JjVI yjjll; (S, TA;) and the 
season which follows the winter, and in which 
the truffles and the blossoms come, they call jll 
but all of them agree that the [or 

autumn] is called AHn says, the 

two divisions of the winter [by which he means 
the half-year commencing at the autumnal 
equinox] are called the former being 

P jUaiVlj »U 1 I [the rabeea of the water and the 
rains, in which the rain called which is 

termed the first of the rains, commences]; 
and the second being j [or ££ j the 

rabeea of the herbage], because the herbage 
therein attains to its last stage: and he adds, 
that j* j is applied by the Arabs to the whole 
winter, [meaning, again, the half-year 
commencing at the autumnal equinox,] because 
of the moisture, or rain: (TA:) or the year consists 
of six seasons; (so in the K; but in the S, “and I 
heard Abu-l-Ghowth say, the Arabs make the 
year to be six seasons; ”) two months thereof are 
called lJjYI yjjll; and two months, ^ and two 
months, (S, K;) and two months, £wj, 
(so in a copy of the S,) or uPdll ^ (so in another 
copy of the S, [but in the margin of this latter, I 
find it stated that in the handwriting of the 
author it is cs-iljil £«j, without tenween,]) or yjjll 
(K;) and two months, sjjji.; and two 
months, (s, K.) Az relates, with respect to 
the seasons and divisions of the year, on the 
authority of Aboo-Yahya Ibn-Kibaseh, who 
possessed very great knowledge thereof, that the 
year consists of four seasons; namely, JjYI 
which the vulgar call [The autumn]; 

then [the winter]; then L which is 

[or i- e. the spring]; then -1=4“' [the 
summer, or hot season]: all this is what the Arabs 
in the desert say: the which is with the 


Persians the _>»■, he says, commences on the 
third of Jjhl [September O. S.]; and the on 
the third of JjSlt [December O. S.]; and 

the b - - 0 which is with the Persians the 
on the fifth of [March O. S.]; and the 
which is with the Persians the ^ on the fourth 
of [June O. S.]: and Aboo-Yahya adds, 

the of the people of El-' Irak agrees with 
the jjjj of the Persians, which is after the [or 
winter], and which is the season of the flowers, or 
roses, and is the most temperate of the seasons: 
the people of El-' Irak, he says, have rain in all 
the winter, and have abundance of herbage in 
the — ^ which the Arabs call JjYI yjjll; and Az 
says, the quarter of the is called — ^ 

because the fruits are gathered therein; and the 
Arabs call it because the first rain [which 
is called (s-^j^] falls therein. (TA.) The pi. of 
is jl [a pi. of pauc.] and [a pi. of mult.] (S, 
Msb, K) and j^j; (AHn, K;) or the first of these is 
pi. of (Fr, Yaakoob, S, Msb, K) and 

of the of the months; (Fr, Msb;) but the 
second is pi. of in the sense of to be 
explained below. (Fr, Yaakoob, S, Msb, K.) 
Hence the phrase in a supplication, mentioned in 
a trad., £jjj 3 [O God, make 
Thou the Kur-an to be the life, or ease, of 
my heart]; because the heart of man becomes 
lively, or at ease, in the season called (TA.) 
Hence also, (TA,) The [or hoopoe]; 

(K;) because it appears with the [season 
called] £wj. (TA.) [See also, respecting the 

seasons & c., the word i> j.] Also The rain in 

the [season called] £±y [as meaning the half-year 
commencing at the autumnal equinox, (which 
includes what is really the spring of Arabia, called 
“ the rabeea of the herbage,”) accord, to a 
statement of AHn cited above, and accord, to 
what is stated on the authority of AZ voce l jj] : (S, 
K:) or [only, accord, to some,] the rain which is 
after the and after which is [that called] 

the and then the or, accord, to AHn, 
rain whenever it comes: Az says, I have heard 
the Arabs call thus the first rain falling upon the 
earth in the days of the — ^ [or autumn]: (TA:) 
the pi. [of pauc.] is and [of 

mult.] (AHn, TA.) [See also, respecting the 

rains, the word j.] Also Herbage; green 

herbage which the beasts eat; (TA;) [properly] 
the herbage that is produced by the first rain in

commonly called the [or autumn], (Msb in 
art. i> j,) [continuing its growth during the 
winter-quarter, which is also called the £Hj, and 
which includes, as stated above, what is really the 


spring of Arabia, called “ the rabeea of the

the office of head, or chief; in consideration of the 
taking of the [or fourth part of the

the 333 in a she-camel, which consists in her 
quivering and then being quiet: (TA:) or because 
of the contractedness of its feet, and the fewness 
of its letters: (S, K:) or because it is 

[characterized by] jj-4, without 333 1 [lit. 
breasts without rumps; for, as the two hemistichs 
generally rhyme with each other, the verse seems 
as though it had no 333; i. e., as though its last 
foot should rather be called 3= jj3, like the last of 
the first hemistich, than 34:] (TA:) Akh once 
said, 333, with the Arabs, is whatever consists of 
three feet; and it is that [kind of verse]

a kind of rhyming prose; but Kh held it to be 
true verse, or poetry: so in the M: but in the T it is 
said [as in the K] that Kh asserted it to be not 
poetry, but halves or thirds of verses: one of his 
reasons for this assertion [the only one that 
seems to have had much weight with the 
Muslims] is, that Mo- hammad once said, 1='

of a species of 43, meaning, "I am the Prophet: 
it is no lie: I am the son of 'Abd-el-Muttalib ”]:

is shown by what is said in the Kur., xxxvi. 69:

S:) or the part below its -4“ [q. v.]: accord, to 
AHn, it is more complete, or perfect, than its 4;: 
accord, to IAar, 44 343' means, when the

34 j also signifies (tropical:) A part, or portion,

said in a trad. of'Arsheh, sUi 34j 4 jji U1 <4' 
4ij£ V] I 'giainw ‘44“, meaning (tropical:) [Aboo- 
Bekr gave to us] the half of a roasted sheep,

shares, except its shoulder-blade, or its 
shoulder]: she called the half thus by 

a synecdoche: (IAth, O, TA:) or she meant the leg 
(34 j) thereof, with what was next to it [for 44 
in the O and TA, I read 44 4] of the lateral half: 
or she thus alluded to the whole thereof, like as 
one does by the term 44. (O, TA. [But see what 
here next follows.]) And in another trad., the 34 j 
of a [wild] ass is mentioned as a gift, 
meaning (tropical:) One of the two lateral halves:

explained as meaning the whole; but this is a 
mistake. (Mgh.) — — Also (assumed tropical:) 
The half of a 44 [or pair of leathern bags, such 
as are borne by a camel, one on each side,] 

of wine, and of olive-oil. (AHn, K.) It is also 

applied by some to (assumed tropical:) A pair of 
trousers or drawers; and 343“ 34 j occurs in 
this sense in a trad., for 343“ j; like £ jj 
and 33 £ jj, whereas each is properly 443j; for 
the 3j' J“ are of the articles of clothing for the 
two legs: (IAth, TA:) this is what is meant by 
the saying in the K [and in the O likewise] 
that 344 also signifies 3j'34l [app. for O* 
jlLlI 3 j'j 4I], (TA.) — — Also 

(assumed tropical:) A swarm, or numerous 
assemblage, of locusts: (S:) or a detached number 
(44a) thereof: (K:) [or] one says [or says 
also] 34 j, (S, TA,) and j4 34 j: it is 

masc. and fem.: (TA:) a pi. without a proper 
sing.; like (a herd of [wild] asses, S) and 44 
(a flock of ostriches, S) and 4 'jO< 5-= (a herd of 
[wild] bulls or cows, S): (S, K:) pi. 343'; (K:) and 
so in the next two senses here following. (TA.) — 
— And hence, as being likened thereto, (TA,) 
(assumed tropical:) An army: (K:) or a numerous 
army. (TA.) — — Also (assumed tropical:) A 
share in a thing. (IAar, K.) So in the saying, 4 4 
34 j ‘4'“ (assumed tropical:) [To me belongs a 

share in thy property]. (TA.) And (tropical:) 

A time. (TA.) One says, <4 34 J 4° 4 

(tropical:) That was in the time of such a one; (S, 
K, TA;) in his life-time: (K, TA:) like the 

phrase <4 44 4°. (TA.) Also (assumed 

tropical:) Precedence. (Abu-1- Mekarim, K.) 
When the files of camels are collected together, 
an owner, or attendant, of camels says, 344' 4, i.

saying in the Kur [lxxi. 12], Ijlaj Jy?-'y V f51 U 
means (assumed tropical:) [What aileth you]

for God's magnifying of him who serves Him 
and obeys Him? or that ye will not believe in 
greatness, or majesty, belonging to God, so that 
ye may fear disobeying Him? (Bd:)

art. J*j,) i. e. [When the 3k are moistened by 
rain, then pray ye, or then prayer shall be 
performed,] in the houses, or habitations, or 
places of abode; the 3k meaning here the J3=s 
(IAth, TA in the present art.;) or rugged and hard 
tracts of ground; which are here particularized 
because the least wet moistens them, whereas the 
soft tracts dry up the water: (IAth, TA in art. J":) 
Az says that the meaning is, when the hard 
grounds are rained upon, they become slippery to 
him who walks upon them; therefore pray ye in 
your abodes, and there shall not be anything 
brought against you for your not being present 
at the prayer in the mosques of the 
congregations: (TA in that art.:) or the trad, may 
mean, then pray ye [on the camels' saddles, i. e.] 

riding. (TA in the present art.) In another 

trad., it is related that 'Omar said to the 
Prophet, kk jUll l _ ? Lk j kl jk; by the word Jkj, 
as signifying [properly] either the “ place of 
abode and resort ” or the “ saddle upon which 
camels are ridden,” alluding to his wife; 

meaning Ik jji i kg^. Ijlia ^ (TA.) 

i i-k-kJ I 3kj means The thing [or desk] upon 
which the [or copy of the Kur-an] is put, in 

shape [somewhat] like the saddle. (TA.) [It is 
generally a small desk of which the front and 
back have the form of the letter X; commonly 
made of palm-sticks.] — [The pi.] 3k j also 


signifies [Carpets, or cloths, or the like, such as 
are called] of the fabric of El-Heereh. (S, 

K.) kik j Strength; [app. in a camel, such as 
renders fit for the saddle, or for journeying;] and 
fleetness, or swiftness, and excellence: (TA:)

drawn near]: and 3 l 3! kk_; k kil and j kikj 
Verily he is one who journeys, or has journeyed, 
to the kings: (Lh, TA:) and in like manner kikj is 

used in the Kur cvi. 2 : (TA:) or J, kikj with 

damm, (S, Msb, K,) signifies The thing to which 
one removes, departs, or journeys; (AZ, Msb;) or 
the direction, or point, or object, to which one 
desires to repair, or betakes himself: (AA, S, Msb, 
K:) and also, (K,) or kikj, (TA,) a single journey; 
(K, TA;) as ISd says: (TA:) you say, j ikkj kii 
Mekkeh is the point, or object, to which I desire

t^klkj Ye are they to whom I remove, or depart, or

object to which we repair, or betake ourselves. 
(Msb.) And hence J. kikj is applied to signify A 
noble, or an exalted, person, or a great man of 
learning, to whom one journeys for his [the 
latter's] need, or want, or for his [the former's] 

science. (TA.) See also the next preceding

Msb, K,) in which is no wood; used for vehement 
running [of the horse]: (S, M, K:) ISd says also 
that it is one of the vehicles [or saddles] of 
women, like the 3k j: but Az says that it is one of 
the vehicles [or saddles] of men, exclusively 
of women, i. e. not of women; as is also the 3kj: 
and some say that it is larger than the £ jk, 
covered with skins, and is for horses, and 
for excellent, or strong and light and swift, 
camels: (TA:) pi. 3k j. (S.) When a man is hasty 
in doing evil to his companion, one says to 
him, klillk j ciaAkkl [lit. Thy saddle has got before

which another was more fit to do so. (S in

addressing his wife, ^jk ^ j^lk kilkj ^jk Ula

being in this case no kk j in reality: it is like the 
saying, 3ikll kali 3° jMa ilk, meaning [“ Such a 
one came upon] the sandal [or sandals]: ” Jabir is 
the name of a certain carpenter. (S.) — Also 
A ewe. (Ibn-'Abbad, TA.) [Hence,] kilk j kJlk j is A 
call to the ewe, (Ibn-'Abbad, K,) on the occasion

perfectness of make, and beauty of aspect: but 
this explanation is wrong: (Az, TA:) it signifies a 
he-camel, and a she-camel, that is excellent, or 
generous, or high-bred, or strong and light and 
swift: (Az, Mgh, TA:) the she-camel is not more 
entitled to this appellation than the he-camel: 
(Az, TA:) the » is added to give intensiveness to 
the signification; as in 5j*ld and and 
epithets applied to a man: or, as some say, the 
she-camel is so called because she is saddled; and 
it is like 5k=lj 5iie meaning 5i==3*, and (A = 1 * 
meaning 3 A*: or, as others say, because she 
is 3=3 cjli [one having a saddle]; and in 
like manner, 5==0 53 y? means 'A, and * 1 = 

3® 1 - means A A: (TA:) the pi. is 3=1 jj. (S, Msb.) 
It is said in a trad., A? uA 53* ls - 3 * 3 lA 1 Oj-A

the 3=1 j among a herd of camels is conspicuous 

and known. (TA.) A- 1 j j c=A a phrase used 

by the poet Dukeyn, means (tropical:) I have 
become hoary and weak: or, as some say, I have 
forsaken my ignorant, or foolish, behaviour, and 
have restrained myself from foul conduct, and 
become obedient to my censurers; like as 
the 51=1 j obeys her chider, and goes. (TA.) 3 lA' 3: 
see 3=3, first sentence. -—V j=0 A camel's saddle, 
(3=0, Az, K,) or camel's saddles, so in the O, 
(TA,) variegated, figured, or embellished. (Az, O, 
K, TA.) [It is really, as well as literally, a pi.: for] a 
poet says, 3^ £> V AO usA [Upon them 
(referring evidently to she-camels) are 
variegated, figured, or embellished, saddles of

K;) because it is the place of the 3=0 [or rather of 
the 511= j] ; (Mgh, TA;) the whiteness not reaching 
to the belly nor to the rump nor to the neck: (TA:) 
and a sheep or goat black in the back: accord, to 
Abu-l-Ghowth, the fern., *13= 3, applied to a mare, 
has the former meaning only: (S:) but 
> 1==0 means a sheep or goat, or a ewe or she- 
goat, white in the back, and black in the other 
parts; and likewise black in the back, and white 
in the other parts: (S, K: *) so says Abu-l- 
Ghowth: (S:) and it is also explained as meaning 
black, but white in the place of the saddle, 
from the hinder parts of the shoulderblades: also 
as meaning white, but black in the back: Az adds 
that such as is white in one of the hind legs 
is termed £5LLj [with ?==]. (TA.) 3y=3 3 (assumed 
tropical:) A whiteness predominating over, or 
interrupted by, blackness, (5A3,) or a 
redness, upon the shoulder-blades, (K, TA,) the 
place upon which lies the 3=3 [or camel's saddle]. 
(TA.) <h=jj A thing that makes thee to remove, 


go, go away, depart, go forth, or journey; expl. 
by ‘Aljj U. (TA.) 3=3= One who breaks, or trains, 
and renders fit to be saddled, a camel or 

camels. (TA.) A man having many [camels 

such as are termed] 3=1 33 [pi. of 5A'3]; like A A* 
meaning “ having horses such as are termed A 3 ? 
” (A'Obeyd, S.) — A camel strong in the back, [so 
as to be fit for the 3=3,] after weakness. (IDrd, 
TA.) And A fat camel; though he be not excellent,

journeys in about a day: (Msb:) sing, of 3=13*; (S, 
Msb, K;) which is also a pi. of 3=3* as an epithet 
applied to a -35. (TA.) One says, lA 3 £j A 3

contr. meanings. (K.) — — And 3=3* -A A 
garment of the kind termed Jjj upon which are 
the figures of a 3=3 [or camels' saddle], (K,) and 
the like thereof; as in the T: (TA:) the explanation 
that J has given of it, [or rather of 3=3* A3*,] i. e. 
an Jjt [or a waist- wrapper] of [the cloth 
called] 3 = upon which is an ornamented border, 
is not good: such is termed 3=3*, with f*=: (K:) 
the pi. is cjitAA and 3=13*; both occurring in 
traditions; (TA in the present art.;) and the latter 
of them said in the T to be syn. with 3=13*, which 
is pi. of 3=3* [q. v.]. (TA in art. 3=j.) 3^=3*: 
see 3==j. 3=>3* signifies [The act of removing or

she did not receive impregnation: or she brought 
forth without letting fall her secundine: (K, TA:)

letting fall her secundine, by a sheep or goat, is 
termed J, A 3. (TA.) - — A3, aor. A3, inf.

read, conjecturally, A* 3 , as the only word at all 
resembling -A, that I can call to mind, having an 
apposite signification,] and they did not anoint it, 
or grease it, so that it became spoilt, or in a bad

applied to it in this case is J, A3- (TA.) — —

have one, is app. A3,] signifying The being 
connected by relationship. (TA.) 2 5A A j, inf.

chaste; He said to him, ■dll -d*=3 [May God have

God have mercy on thee; &c.; (see 2 ;) or he 
expressed a wish that God would have mercy on 
him; or he expressed pity, or compassion, for

Raghib, 4xkj signifies tenderness requiring the 
exercise of beneficence towards the object 
thereof: and it is used sometimes as meaning 
tenderness divested of any other attribute: and 
sometimes as meaning beneficence divested 

of tenderness; as when it is used as an attribute 
of the Creator: when used as an attribute of men, 
it means tenderness, and inclination to 

favour [without necessarily implying 
beneficence]: accord, to El-Kashanee, it is of two 
kinds; namely, gratuitous, and obligatory: the 
former is that which pours forth favours, or 
benefits, antecedently to works; and this is 
the 4*=. j that embraces everything: the obligatory 
is that which is promised to the pious and the 
doers of good, in the Kur vii. 155 and vii. 54 : but 
this, he says, is included in the gratuitous, 
because the promise to bestow it for works is 
purely gratuitous: accord, to the explanation of 
the Imam Aboo-Is-hak Ahmad Ibn-Mohammad- 
Ibn-Ibraheem Eth-Thaalebee, it is God's desire to 
do good to the deserving thereof; so that it is an

a name of its last letter, or more; (S, TA;) as 
when, to one whose name is 4 jlk or 44 you

which the hole of the [lizard called] is 
broken, or battered, when it is among large 
stones (4*Ja [i. e. e^]), which ■*■*2 it softens 

and demolishes: (En-Nadr, T:) the same word 
(» 4 j^) also signifies the stone, (T,) or the piece of 
rock, (M,) by means of which the is guided to 
its hole: (T, M:) [and accord, to Golius, on the 
authority of Meyd and the Mirkat el-Loghah, the 
upper mill-stone:] the pi. of is J, py: (T:)

of oli and meaning the arrows thus called; or 
any missiles]. (M.) Hence the prov., J. 3 ^ P- 
ijbj^ vui [Near by the hole of every dabb is 
its stone that is to he thrown at it, or its stone by 
means of which it guides itself to that hole]; 
applied to a thing that is near at hand, having no 
obstacle in the way to it; for the dabb will not be 
guided to its hole, when it goes forth from it and 
returns to it, except by means of a stone which it 
places as a mark to point out its hole: (T:) or 
[ *^*'y Siic (S, M, Meyd) i. e. Every dabb has 
near by it its stone that is to be thrown at it; (S, * 
Meyd;) for the dabb has little knowledge, 
therefore it prepares not its hole save by a stone 
that may be a mark thereof, so that he who seeks 
it finds the stone that is to be thrown at the dabb 
near to it; therefore the prov. means that 
thou shouldst not feel secure from accidents, 
because calamities are prepared with every time, 
or period; and it is applied to him who exposes 
himself to destruction. (Meyd.) Hence also, i. e. 
from Py in the first of the senses assigned to it 
above, (S,) or in the second of those senses, 
(Ham p. 417,) said of a courageous man, lS~ 3*1

horse that runs swiftly; from u^jll [an inf. n. 
of PP, q. v.]: or it is from P±P [inf. n.

straitness and drought or barrenness or dearth; 
and by 3** j, plenty, and abundance of herbage or 
the like; because 3** j, i. e. milk, is plentiful only 
in the case of abundance of herbage; so that the

plenty. (TA.) — The j33j of a horse are The

necessarily used; but in ch. xxvi. it means the 
message, and therefore it is allowable to use it 
alike, when applying it as an epithet, as sing, and

the sense of 33 j in his saying, *« jll j *. j 1*11 ^*511

which is the most commonly used, (TA,) i. q. 3*3 
[as meaning A bribe]; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) a thing 
that one gives to a judge, or to another person, in 
order that he may judge in his [the 
giver's] favour, or to incite him to do what he [the 
giver] desires; (Msb, TA;) or a means of attaining 
that which one wants, by bribery; not 
including what is given as a means of obtaining a 
right or repelling a wrong; for it is related on the 
authority of several of the leading doctors of 
the Tabi'ees that there is no harm in man's 
bribing for the defence of himself and his 
property when he fears being wronged; so says 
IAth: and Lth explains the last of these three 
words as meaning an act of bribery: (TA:) accord, 
to Abu-l-'Abbas [i. e. Th], (TA), the former 
meaning is from l3j said of a young bird, 
explained in the first sentence of this art.: (Msb, 
TA:) or it is from =l3jll, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) 
signifying “ that by means of which one obtains 
water,” (IAth, TA,) or “ the rope of the bucket: ” 
(Mgh:) or, accord, to ISd, the reverse of this is 
the case: (TA:) the pi. (of the first, Msb, TA) is l3j 
or and (of the second, Msb, TA) Lij or ^j. 
(S, Msb, K, TA.) =l3j A rope: (S, Msb, K:) [or a 
well-rope; i. e.] the rope of the bucket: (Mgh:) 
and l also, with kesr, has the same 

meaning as =l3j ; (K:) hence it would seem that 
this is generally the case; but they have expressly 
declared that the latter word has not been heard 
except in relation to the like of an enchantment, 
or a fascination: so says MF, pointing to the 
saying of Lh, that among the phrases of women 
who enchant, or fascinate, men is elia* 

=133== jl*3 3U1I [1 have enchanted him, or 
fascinated him, with a gourd, filled with water, 
suspended by a rope, or well-rope]; 
and that =13 jj, meaning a rope, is not thus said 
except in this enchantment, or fascination: 
accord, to ISd, the last radical of =13 j is judged to 
be j because one obtains water by means of 
the =13 j, like as one obtains the thing sought by 
means of the »3“j; which is the reverse what 


has been said above, that »j3jll is from =13j!t; 
(TA:) the pi. is 3j3jl. (s, Mgh, Msb, K.) — — 
il3jll is also the name of (assumed tropical:) 
A Mansion of the Moon; (K, TA;) [the Twenty- 
eighth, which is the last, of the Mansions of the 
Moon;] so called as being likened to a rope; 
(TA;) [the northern fish, of the constel-lation 
Pisces, together with the star beta of Andromeda; 
or, more correctly, delta and epsilon, with 
some neighbouring stars, of Pisces;] a group of 
many stars, in the form of a fish, with the tail 
towards the south and the head towards the

is the name of the bright star [beta] that 
is above the drapery round the waist of 
Andromeda: (Kzw, descr. of Andromeda:] =13 jll

(K.) [See 4, last sentence.] lP 'j The giver of a »>3 j

i. e. [May God curse] the giver of

the receiver thereof, and him who is agent 
between them two, demanding more for this or 
less for this. (IAth, TA.) =l3jj : see =13 j, first

(IAth, TA.) [See an ex. above, voce i_3I3.] A

a gki; ” though j-i>gA has a verb bearing a 
signification agreeing with this; and it sometimes 
occurs as meaning having milk, though not 
having a child that is suckled: (IB:) but the latter 
is used in describing a woman as performing an 
action; (Kh;) signifying suckling a child: (S, K:) 
the former is used when the [abstract] quality is 
meant: the latter, when the action is meant: 
but God knows: (Akh:) or the former signifies 
one who is near to suckling, but has not yet 
suckled: and one having with her the child that 
is suckled [by her] (£*^gH ifi-JI): and the latter, 
[in the TA the former, but this is a 
mistranscription, as is shown by what follows,] 
one who is suckling, her teat being in the mouth 
of her child; and in this sense it is used in the 
Kur, in a passage which see below: (AZ in the 
TA:) Th says, the latter signifies one who suckles, 
though she have not a child, or if she have a 
child: and the former, one who has not a child 
with her, and sometimes having with her a child: 
and in one place he says, when the action is 
meant, the latter is used, and it is made an 
epithet: and when the » is not added, it is meant 
as a subst: (TA:) Fr and some others say that it is 
without » when the proper signification 
of suckling is meant: and with » when the tropical 
signification of a subject of the attribute of 
suckling in time past or future is meant: (Msb:) 
the pi. [of both, though said in the Mgh and TA to 
be that of the former,] is £~=lgi (Mgh, Msb, TA) 
and t^gi. (Msb, TA.) The saying in the Kur 
[xxii. 2 ], ClwAajI IaC 

means [On the day when ye shall see it,] every 
woman that is suckling;, (AZ, Kh,) in the act of 
doing so, (Kh,) with her teat in the mouth of her 
child; (AZ,) [shall neglect, or become heedless of 
or diverted from, that which she shall have been 
suckling:] or here has the last

have been suckling or shall be going to suckle].

applied to the [or Persians, or foreigners in 
general]; because they were red; (S, A;) or

TA in art. Asj;) or rather because of the thickness 
thereof, as though they were full. (MF in

manner also a she-camel of which no offspring 
lives: (TA:) or he who has no offspring: (Msb:) or 
he who has not sent before him [to Paradise, by

children: (TA:) he who has had no child die in 
infancy: or he who has had children and has died 
without sending before him any of them [to 
Paradise, by its dying in infancy]. (So in the

— Also The of the players at the game 

called (JK, K;) or (K) he who is intrusted 

with the supervision of the [or shuffler of

four notches [and four portions]; the fifth, 
which has five notches [and five portions]; the 
sixth, which has six notches [and six 

portions]; and the seventh, the highest of

gaming-arrows, and then (assumed tropical:) 
any two portions,] he means her eyes: and as 
the csi*-* has seven portions and the j 
has three, the would gain the whole of his 
heart. (TA. [See also a verse cited voce j^.]) — 
— AySj signifies (tropical:) The star, or 

asterism, that sets with the rising of that [other] 
star, or asterism: for example, the yy 5 j of 4 jj 1I 
is [and the former is the j of the latter:] 

when the latter rises at nightfall, the former sets: 
(S, TA:) or mJj signifies the star, or asterism, 
which [as it were] watches, (m^Ih,) in the east, 
the star, or asterism, setting in the west: or any 
one of the Mansions of the Moon is the j of 
another: (K, TA:) whenever any one of them 
rises, another [of them] sets: (TA: [see >41! J 
in art. J jj; and see also cjy:]) and CySjll 
is (assumed tropical:) a [certain] star, or 
asterism, of the stars, or asterisms, [that were 
believed to be the givers] of rain, that [as it were] 
watches another star, or asterism: (K:) [it was

most noted and most welcome of all

to u 1 jPl (assumed tropical:) [i. e. The Hyades; or 
the five chief stars of the Hyades; or the brightest 
star among them, a of Taurus]; because a 
follower thereof: (A:) [and] (assumed 

tropical:) [i. e. Capella] is so called as being 
likened to the yys j of the game called (TA.) 

[Hence,] one says, 4jj]l j 1 

(tropical:) [I will not come to thee unless 

their yy 5 j meet the Pleiades]. (A.) yysj also 

signifies (tropical:) A man's successor, (A, K,) of 
his offspring, and of his » j ^4° [i. e. kinsfolk, or 
nearer or nearest relations by descent from the 
same ancestor, &c.]. (K.) So in the saying,

most excellent, is the successor; such art thou to 
thy father and thine ancestors]: because the 
successor is like JjPl to (a.) — — And 
(assumed tropical:) The son of a paternal uncle.

of this paragraph, and that the pi. *4 4' is here 
governed in the accus. case by a verb understood, 
and [with that verb] is a denotative of 
state relating to the agent in jr“: it supplies the

quadruped,] the joint between the metacarpus

right explanation: in the K, £44 is erroneously 
put for J*4: [this explanation is evidently given 
accord, to the terms employed in the anatomy of 
quadrupeds as compared to human beings: in 
that which next follows, there is certainly an 
omission, which I have endeavoured to supply:]

two joints that [project forwards, in like manner

two joints that project behind [in the hind legs, 
namely, the hocks,] are called the 0443°: 
in every quadruped, the 34 j are in the fore legs, 
and the 3)44 are in the hind legs: and 
the is what is called 444' 545* [i. e. 

the upper joint of the metatarsus]: (TA:) or 
the 4j is the *43? [which in a man is the elbow,

that the 43 is “ well known,” I conclude that 
there is no real discrepancy in the foregoing 
explanations: it is perhaps needless to add that 
the term 4j is now universally applied to

growing forth at the top of the trunk of a palm- 
tree, and, in some instances, bearing with its 
mother; but when it is cut off, it is better for the 
mother: and 440 is also explained in the L as 
meaning small palm-trees that grow forth at the 


lower parts of large palmtrees: (TA:) or it means 
a shoot of a palm-tree not cut off from its mother: 
(Ham p. 66:) accord, to As, when a palm-shoot 
grows from the trunk, and does not adhere to the 
ground, it forms a vile kind of palm-tree; and the

this is perhaps what is meant by the

(<“ <_s34 4 [in the CK -Mp L>]), such as dominion 
(41i [in the CK 41i]) ; and an army, or a military

occurring in the Kur [li. 39], where it is said,

turned away from belief with his forces; because 
they were to him like the l4j [properly so

whom he is aided and strengthened: thought by 
ISd to be thus called by way of comparison [to 


a c4j properly so termed]: and thus it has been 
explained as used in the Kur [xi. 82], where it is 
said, l4j 3 ji jl (assumed tropical:) [Or that 
I might have recourse to a strong people, or 
party, &c.]: (TA:) or it here means “34^

Mja g43' Of (assumed tropical:) [He is a noble, 
of the nobles of his people]. (TA.) And 343 1 
means (assumed tropical:) The members, 
or limbs, of the man, with which things are 
gained or earned, or with which he works; as the 

hands or arms, and the feet or legs. (TA.) 

Also (assumed tropical:) Might, and resistance: 
(S, K:) so in the saying, 4P JJ jl) > 
(assumed tropical:) [He has recourse to strong, 
or vehement, might and resistance]: (S:) and so 
it has been explained as used in the words of the 

Kur last cited above. (TA.) And (assumed 

tropical:) A thing, an affair, a case, an event, or 
an action, of great magnitude or moment, 
momentous, formidable, or terrible. (AHeyth, K.) 
Thus AHeyth explains it as used in the saying of 
En-Nabighah [Edh-Dhubyanee], V jj jap V 
<1 [By no means reproach thou me with a 
momentous, or a formidable, thing or action, or 
an enormity, that has not its equal; though (he 
proceeds to say) the enemies incite thee, with 
companies of men aiding one another]. (TA.) — 
— In the conventional language [of the 
schools], 3 S j means (assumed tropical:) 

[The essence of the thing; or] that whereby the 
thing subsists: from fjP; because the [° r 
subsistence] of the thing is by its i£j: not 
from JP: else it would necessarily be the case 
that the agent would be a jj to the action; and 
the substance, to the accident; and the thing to 
which a quality is attributed, to the quality: (KT:) 
it is (assumed tropical:) that without which the 
thing has no subsistence: (Kull:) and is [also] 
applied to (assumed tropical:) [an essential, or 
essential part, of the thing; i. e.,] a part of 
the <PL> [or essence] of the thing, (Kull, [and in 
like manner ? JP u43' is explained in the Msb as 
meaning the parts of the <j*L> of the thing,]) as 
when we say that pP is a jj of dUl; as well as 
to (assumed tropical:) the whole <j*Li [of the 
thing]: (Kull:) [thus] cjbUxll 3^3! means 

(assumed tropical:) the fundamentals 
[or essentials] of the services of religion, by the 
neglect, or non-observance, of which they are 
ineffectual, or null, or void: (TA:) or, as some 
say, ? JP 0^ J means that whereby the thing is 
complete; and this is intrinsic therein; differing 
from the Pm [or condition] thereof, which is 
extrinsic thereto. (KT.) 3P3 A mountain having

earth and water: (M, K:) or much wealth; (K;) as 
in the S: (TA:) and it is said in the copies of the K, 
[and in the M,] that ^14' signifies what is borne 
[on its surface] by the water; but this is a 
signification of and signifies what is 
borne by the wind: (TA:) or what is upon the 
ground, of fragments of dry herbage. (M, K.) [See 

also art. <4.] Also Marrow. (T, S, M, K.) j 

The remains of a rope after it has become ragged,

also [ Pj: (M, K:) pi. [of mult.] pj (T, S,) or pj

and fU j; (M, K;) [like cjlijl jp anc j jiUJ pj

the rope] were termed a single thing. (M.) 

Hence the saying, Pjj .tiiLti (assumed 

tropical:) I gave him the thing altogether: (T:)

him the thing altogether: (S:) or 

Pji (assumed tropical:) He took it altogether:

pj j (assumed tropical:) I brought thee, 

or have brought thee, the thing altogether: (M:) 
or P’ji »Uae.i (assumed tropical:) He gave it

that is put upon the neck of the camel: (T:) [i. e.] 
originating from the fact that a man gave to 
another a camel with a rope upon his neck: 
(S, K:) or from the fact that a man sold a camel 
with a rope upon his neck; and it was said, Give 
him with his j: (Msb:) or, as some say, from 
the bringing a captive bound with his j; but 
this is not a valid assertion. (M.) In all the copies 
of the K, Pp is also expl. as syn. with Vk-J 1 ; but 
[SM says,] I have not found it in the originals 
from which it is derived; and may-be the right 
reading is (TA.) 'Alee said, dispraising the 
present world, meaning

it signifies A thing, (S, M,) meaning (S) an animal

not Ki*'j* converted into <“j: (S:) or, accord, to 
Sb, the », in general, is affixed to show that the act

thereof; [so that the meaning is, an animal to be 
thrown at, cast at, shot at, or shot;] and thus 
is applied to “ a sheep, or goat, [to be slaughtered 
or sacrificed,] not yet slaughtered [or sacrificed]; 
” but when the act has been executed upon it, it is 
[said to be] jwA (M:) the pi. is cjlAj and Llij.

You say, 3*3 3*- *33 He rode until he became 
lean, or emaciated. (ISh, TA. [See 0*1 j.]) — As 

trans., see 4, first signification. [Hence,] as 

a law term, 0* j signifies The putting, or placing, 
an article of real property [to remain] as a pledge, 
or security, or making it to be such, for a debt 
that is obligatory or that will become obligatory.

ISJU 3* 3' [i. e. leaving with them, as a pledge, 
Malik]: he likens this phrase to the say ing j *31*5 
<3-3 .iLLai; an( i this is a good way of explaining it; 
for the j is that which is a deno tative of state; the 
meaning being <s4j l£U-s> : [accord, to the former 
reading, in the opinion of Th,] the poet means I 
left Malik remaining with them; not as a pledge; 
because [when the leaving a thing as a pledge is 
meant, in his opinion,] one does not say, j. 

33*3', but only <£*3. (S, TA.) [See, however, 4.] 
You say also, <4 <3a j inf. n. u*3, meaning He

outstrip, or overcome. (Msb.) The inf. ns.

largely for it until I obtained it: (TA:) accord, to 
ISk, I paid in advance for the commodity; 
syn. 33131 ; (s, TA;) and in the T it is said, [and in

signifies <4 l-sU : (TA:) [in the K it is said 
that <**jl signifies “3134 as though it meant he 
lent him a sum of money &c.:] accord, to Er- 
Raghib, the proper meaning [of 3*3!] is 
one's giving a com modify before [the full 
payment of] the price, and so making it to be 
pledged for the completion of its price. (TA.) —

(Mgh.) 0*3, originally an inf. n., (Msb,) is syn. 
with J, 0>*3<; (Mgh, Msb;) i. e. (Msb) it signifies 
[A pledge;] a thing deposited with a person (Msb, 
* K) to be in lieu of a thing that has been taken, 
or received, from him; (K;) or a thing that is 
deposited as a security for a debt: and J, O'* J has 
a similar meaning, but is specially applied to 
a thing that is deposited as a bet, or wager, or 
stake; and is likewise originally an inf. n.: (Er- 
Raghib, TA:) j <3* 3 also, is syn. with 3*3 [as 
meaning the act of giving as a pledge], like 
as <44“* is syn. with f34 the » being added to give 
intensiveness to the significa tion: then, like 3*3, 
it is used as syn. with 0 j* 3* [in the sense 
explained above, as will be seen in what follows 
in this paragraph]; (IAth, TA;) [i. e.] <3 j* 3 is an 
inf. n. like <4*4 applied to denote the pass. part, 
n. [used as a subst. pro perly so termed] like 3*3, 
not as an epithet; (Bd in lxxiv. 41;) [or, in other 
words,] <3*3 signifies anything by reason of 
which a thing [such as a debt or the like] 
is restricted, or appro priated, to oneself; as also 
l <*4 ji: (K: [I here follow two copies of the K, in 
which it is said, <*4 3* > <4*3 *33 <f i>4*4l 1*

TA, <4331* > <4*3, which perverts the meaning, 
though J, 3 j* 3 and ] u4*j“ may be used in the 
same sense as <4*3 and <-*4* 3, as will be seen 
in the course of this paragraph: and in the TA, in 
the place of u4*4l, is put l«, meaning >44*: 
there is, however, this difference between J, <44 j

faculty of making known its ideas by means of 
speech, and of understanding speech, and which 
perishes not with the perishing of the body, being 
a substance, not an accident; as is shown by the 
words in the Kur iii. 163, which refer to the £ jj: 
(Msb:) most of the doctors of the fundamentals 
of religion forbid the diving into this matter, 
because God has abstained from making it 
known: (TA:) the philosophers say that it is the 
blood, by the exhausting of which the life ceases: 
(Msb:) the word is masc., (IAar, IAmb, Az, S, M, 


A, Msb, K, *) thus, with the Arabs, 
differing from (A, for this they make fem., (IAar, 
IAmb, Msb,) but the former is also fem., (S, M, A, 
Msb, K,) app. as meaning (Msb,) as is said 
in the R; (TA;) and most hold it to be as often 
fem. as it is masc.: (MF:) one says -Ajj 
(IA ar, Az, TA) [and also ^.jj meaning His 

soul departed, or went forth]: the pi. is (S, 

Msb.) Also i. q. (K) [properly A blowing

that issues from the £ jj; (TA;) wind, or breath. 
(ADk, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, respecting fire 
that he had struck, and upon which he bade 
his companion to blow, '-*A Give life to it, 

or enliven it, with thy wind [or breath]. (TA.) And 
one says, o' j*N He filled the skin with 
his wind; with his breath. (ADk, TA.) — — 
[Hence,] £ jjll also signifies (assumed tropical:) 
Inspiration, or divine revelation; (Zj, Th, K;) such 
as is imparted by means of an angel: thus in the 
Kur xvi. 2 and xl. 15: so called because it quickens 
from the death of infidelity, and thus is, to a man, 
like the £ jj which is the vital principle of his 
body: (T:) or (so says Zj accord, to the L, but in 
the K “ and ” ) the prophetic commission. (Zj, K.) 

And (assumed tropical:) The Kur-an; (IAar, 

Zj, S, * A, * K;) whereby God's creatures are 
[spiritually] quickened, and guided to the right

Jesus. (S, * A, * K.) And A certain angel,

whose face is like that of a man, and his body like

creatures resembling mankind, but not men: so 
in the Kur lxxviii. 38: (Zj:) or the watchers over

wind]; (Sb, M;) but £u and J, may be used in 
the same sense; i. e. the latter may be used as 
syn. with the former, and they are mentioned by 
some [as analogous] with and 

(Sb, L:) £u is of the fern, gender (IAmb, L, Msb) 
in most cases; (Msb;) and all the other names for

masc. as meaning 4i>: (AZ, Msb:) [it is used by 
physicians as signifying flatus, flatuosity, 
or flatulence; as in the phrase 34>Jc. £u a gross 
flatus:] the pi. [of pauc.] is £ljjf (S, Mgh, Msb, K, 
&c.) and £4jl, (s, Msb, K,) the latter used by 
some, but disallowed by AHat because there is in 


it no kesreh to cause the j to be changed into i_s, 
(L, Msb,) and [the pi. of mult, is] £1 jj, (S, Mgh, 
Msb, K, &c.,) with lS because of the kesreh, 
(Msb,) and £u; (K, but not found by SM in any 
other lexicon;) and the pi. pi. is [pi. 

of £ljji] and [pi. of £13 ’J]: (K:) the dim. 
of £u is [ 34jj. (T, Msb.) £ljj, or another form 
of pi., is often used in a good sense; and the sing., 
in an evil sense; because the Arabs say that 
the clouds are not made to give rain save by 
diverse winds blowing together; and this 
distinction is observed in the Kur-an. (L.) Hence, 
it is related in a trad., that he [Mohammad] used 
to say, when wind rose, ' a'*?' Y j '-ktjj l$l* 4 l 
'-kjj [O God, make it to be winds, and made it not 
to be a wind]. (TA.) [But this distinction is not 
always observed.] One says, <yj lK £> J#" 
(tropical:) [Such a one inclines, or turns, with 
every wind]. (TA.) And 34 j>JI Cp& [Such a 

one is like the wind that is sent forth to drive the 
clouds, and produce rain; (see the Kur xxv. 50 ;)] 
meaning, (tropical:) quick, or prompt, to do acts 
of kindness, or beneficence. (A.) And 34 j 

(tropical:) A man who is calm, sedate, staid, 
or grave. (A.) — — Also (assumed tropical:) 
Predominance, or prevalence; and power, 
or force. (S, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Suleyk 
Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, or Taabbata-Sharra, or Aasha of 
the tribe of Fahm, (TA, and so in one of 
my copies of the S,) J iyj 5LJa jl jilil 

^aU]] jtjjll jli (assumed tropical:) [Will ye two 
await, a little, the time of their inadvertence, or 
will ye act aggressively? for prevalence is for 
the aggressor]. (S.) And hence the phrase in the 
Kur [viii. 48 ], 3 (assumed tropical:) 

[And your predominance, or power, depart]: (S:) 
[or in this latter instance it has the meaning next 
following.] — — (tropical:) Aid against an 
enemy; or victory, or conquest: (K, TA:) and 
(tropical:) a turn of good fortune. (A, K, TA.) One 
says, (tropical:) Their turn of good 

fortune departed. (A.) And Is-Vnfcla -iilUj lil 
(tropical:) [When thy turns of good fortune 
come, avail thyself of them]. (A.) And 3Y £0^ 
(tropical:) Aid against the enemy, or victory or 
conquest, or the turn of good fortune, is to 

the family of such a one. (TA.) See also £ 4 5- 

And see 3^jlj (with which it is syn.), in four 

places. — — Also (assumed tropical:) A good, 

sweet, or pleasant, thing. (K.) The pi. £35' 

occurs in a trad, as meaning (tropical:) The jinn,

invisible, like the wind. (TA.) 3^.1 j Rest, repose, or 
ease; contr. of m* 4 (TA;) cessation of trouble, 
or inconvenience, and of toil, or fatigue; (Msb;) 


[or freedom therefrom;] and J, £35 signifies the 
same as (s, A, K,) from 3^lji«YI; (S, A;) like 
i £35 [mentioned in the first paragraph as an 
inf. n. in a similar sense, as are also 3 AJj and 
i 3^jj and J. 3^.1 jj and J, 3 ^jjj, i. e., as meaning 
the experiencing relief from grief &c.]. (TA.) You 
say, J, <£55 Of U i. e. 3-*l j [There is 

not, for such a one, in this affair, or case, or

£35 5 (tropical:) Do thou that in a state of ease 

(S, A, K) and rest. (A.) See also 4 , near the 

middle of the paragraph. — (assumed tropical:) 
A wife; syn. o« j?: (K:) because one trusts to 
her, or relies upon her, and becomes quiet, or 
easy, in mind. (TA.) — The hand; syn. 3aS : (s, K:) 
or [rather] the palm of the hand; (Msb, MF;) 
for the term includes the 3^1 j with the 
fingers: (MF:) pi. J. £0, (S, A, * Msb, K, *) [or 
rather this, said in the K to be syn. with cjU.1 is 
a coll. gen. n., of which 3^1 j is the n. un.,] and 
[the pi. is] ciiU.1 j. (Msb, K.) You say, » j* 3 i J, £j% 
[They pushed him with the palms of the hands]. 
(A.) The saying of a poet, J, £4 I il 

is explained as meaning When the sun of day has 
set, and men, looking towards it, shield 
themselves from its rays with the palms of 
their hands: or, accord, to IAar, when the [sun of] 
day has become dark, by reason of the dust of 
battle, and it is as though it were setting, 
and people have found rest from its heat. (L. [See 
also £54 in art. £ jj; where other readings are 

mentioned.]) [Hence, app., as seems to be 

indicated in the TA,] (tropical:) A 

certain plant. (K, TA.) — — And 3^Jjll ji 
(assumed tropical:) A sword of El-Mukhtar Ibn- 

Abee-’ Obeyd (K, TA) Eth-Thakafee. (TA.) 

3AI j also signifies A court, an open area, or a

3_=J51I ^ (k, TA) i. e. I left him, or it, more 

clear than the court, open area, or yard, [of a 
house,] or than the palm of the hand; (TA;) 
meaning, (assumed tropical:) without anything.

open tracts of land, producing much herbage, 
(ISh, K,) hard, but comprising soft places and 
[what are termed] ^54 [pi. of 3-i q. v.], not

And its dim. is J, Ajj. (S, A, K. [But see what

with tenween: (T:) and J, lAjj Walk thou, or 
go thou, gently, &c.: (T, A:) so accord, to the 
lexicologists [in general]: but accord, to Sb, it is a 
verbal n.: [for] they said, Ajj j. I-Aj, meaning Act

towards, or with, Zeyd; or grant him a delay, or 
respite; let him alone, or leave him, for a while; 
syn. <4^: hence it has no dual nor pi. nor fern, 
form: and hence they say that it is for I iljj), in the 
sense of Jjjl; as though it were an abbreviated 
dim., formed by the rejection of the 
augmentative letters: this is the opinion of Sb; for 
he holds it to be a substitute for Jjjl; though it 
has a nearer resemblance to Jl jjj because it is 
a noun: others hold it to be the dim. of j jj, and 
cite the saying [of a poet], Ajj eyAij j-« J" 

[As though he were like him who walks, or goes, 
gently, &c.]: but this is a mistake; for Ajj is not 
put in the place of a verb, as ^ jj] is. (M.) Accord. 


to Ibn-Keysan, [Ajj seems to have two contr. 
significations; for they said, lAj a)jj, 
meaning Leave thou Zeyd, or let him alone; and 
also meaning act thou gently towards, or with, 
Zeyd, and retain him, or withhold him. (TA.) One 
says also, ^Ajj j. I jAc, meaning Act thou gently, 
&c., towards, or with, 'Amr; syn. ■dj-ll: (T, * S, M, 
* K:) the Al in this case being a denotative of 
allocution, (T, S, M,) and having no place in 
the desinential syntax: (S, M: *) it is added only 
when Ajj is used in the sense of an imperative; 
(T, S, K;) and to prevent confusion of him who is 
meant to be addressed with him who is not 
meant, because Ajj applies to one and to more 
than one and to the male and to the female; 
though sometimes one says aLjjj to a person 
when one does not fear his being confounded 
with another, using the a! as a corroborative. (T.) 
In this case, [ Ajj is an abbreviated dim. of Jljjj, 
the inf. n. of jjjl. (S.) In like manner also one 
says, (K, TA,) to a male, (TA,) [ cr^Ajj [Act thou 
gently, &c., towards, or with, me]; and to a 
female, J, cr^jj; and [ (K, TA) to two 

persons; (TA;) and J, csAjASajj (K, TA) to males 
more than two; (TA;) and J. (K, TA) to 

females more than two. (TA.) J, Ajj is used in 
four different manners: first, as a verbal n.; as 
in Ajj | IjAc-, (s, K, *) i. e. IjAc- i/J, (S,) 
meaning -d«Al [expl. above]: (S, K:) secondly, as 
an inf. n.; as in Ajj J. jj A c- [virtually meaning the 
same]; the former word being prefixed to 
the latter, governing it in the gen. case; (S, M, * 
K; *) like jll m in the Kur [xlvii. 4], (S, M, 
*) in which the inf. n. is put for its verb; (Jel;) and 
like (s-=JI jjje [expl. in art. j^]: (M:) thirdly, as 
an epithet; as in J, l-Ajj Ijj^ I jjLj [They went, or 
journeyed, at a gentle, or leisurely, rate of going, 
or journeying]; (Sb, S, K;) and Ijj^ j lAjj, in 
which Iji-’ is suppressed: (T:) fourthly, as a 
denotative of state; as in J, l-Ajj fjsll 3-L [The 
people, or party, went, or journeyed, going, or 
journeying, gently, or leisurely]; it being here 
in connection with a determinate noun, and 
therefore a denotative of its state. (S, K.) When it 
is used as a threat, it is with nasb, 
without tenween; (Lth, T, M; *) as in the saying 
of a poet, A ■ 3 jjj j 31 j*Hj jV — 

ijjU [Act thou, or proceed thou, gently, lest our 
coursers neigh, one to another, in El-'Irak: it is as

signifies a kind, or manner, of wishing or

also said, in a trad, of Mo'awiyeh, that he wrote in 
a letter to Ziyad, J, ^ j j j jjj], with damm; (K, 
TA;) but the opinion commonly obtaining with 
the leading lexicologists is, that it is with fet-h; 
except AHeyth, who relates it thus, with damm; 
(TA;) meaning Dismiss thou the £jj from 
thy £ j j; (K, TA;) i. e., the fright, or fear, from thy 
heart: (TA:) for you say ^jj 1 ^jii when the 
young bird quits the egg; and £ jj is fright, or 
fear, which does not depart from itself, but from 
its place, which is the £ jj, with damm; (AHeyth, 
K;) the £ jj in the £ jj being like the young bird 
in the egg: in like manner also one says ^ jj j jil

Dhu-r-Rummeh, though knowing the meaning,

adds, (TA,) one also says, ^jj jjji J, jj>^i Cf,

former probably the right,] meaning [Free thy 
heart from the affair; i. e.] be thou tranquil, and 
without fear. (K, TA.) Az observes, What AHeyth

(assumed tropical:) He ran vehemently: (A 
’Obeyd, S, O, K:) not known, however, to Sh, 
in this sense; but known to him as meaning 
(assumed tropical:) he strove, laboured, toiled, 
or exerted himself, in a thing. (TA.) [Agreeably 
with this last explanation, it is said that] 333 also 
signifies (assumed tropical:) A man's 
determination, or resolution; his action; and 
his purpose, or intention. (K, TA.) And hence the 
saying, <5'33' <P 3 [meaning (assumed 
tropical:) He devoted his mind and energy to it,

“33, meaning his loving it, or him, (<3 u',)

them a soft letter [i. e. ' or j or lS, as in 4' 4 &c.],

two quiescent letters in an instance in which the

the back-bone on each side. (T.) jO [as the act. 
part. n. of lS jj] is used in relation to water [as 
meaning Bringing, or one who brings, water to 
his family: and drawing, or one who draws, water 
for others: and a camel carrying, or that carries, 

water; whence the subst. 4j' 3, q. v.]. (S, TA.) 

And [hence] it is used also in relation to poetry 
(T, S, M) and to traditions or narratives or stories 
(T, M, Mgh, K) [as meaning A relater, reciter, or 
rehearser, by heart, of poetry, and of 
traditions, or narratives or stories, learned, or 
heard, or received, from another]: and in like 
manner J, 4 j 0 , but in an intensive sense [as 
meaning a large, or copious, relater or reciter or 
rehearser, &c.]; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) i. e. 4 1 jjM 3»4; 
(T, * TA;) as in the phrase j4ill 43 3 343 [a man 
who is a large, or copious, relater &c. of poetry]: 
(S:) the pi. of 3 3 is jj. (S, TA.) — Also One who 
has the superintendence, management, or care, 
of horses ( J41 1 ^ f 4 o* [strangely rendered 
by Freytag, who seems to have read 44 4=- , 
“constrictus fune et stans super cameli dorso ”]). 
(M, K.) 433 A camel, (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K,) or 
a mule, or an ass, (S, and so in the K with the 
exception of “ and ” for “ or,”) upon which water 
is drawn: (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K: [see 4'-“*:]) or 
a camel that carries water; (M, * Mgh, Msb;) and 
then applied to any beast upon which water is 
drawn: (Msb:) [but it is disputed whether this 
be the primary or proper signification, or 
whether it be secondary or tropical, as will be 
shown by what follows:] and also a man who 
draws water (A 'Obeyd, T, TA) for his family: 
(TA:) the » is affixed [J“], i. e. for the purpose of 
transferring the word from the category 
of epithets to that of substantives; or] to give 
intensiveness to the signification: (Msb:) pi. 303 
[by rule *03, being originally of 
the measure not 3£l4], (S, M, TA.) Also 

A 3* [or leathern water-bag] (A ’Obeyd, T, S, M, 
Mgh) composed of three skins, (Mgh,) 
containing water; (M, K;) so called as being the 
receptacle in which is the water borne by the 
camel [thus called]; (A 'Obeyd, T;) or the 3* is 
thus termed by the vulgar, but this application of 
the word is allowable as metaphorical: (S:) or it 
signifies a pair of such water-bags 
(gtjjl ji [see 3* in art. 30]): (T:) [accord, to 
ISd,] it is applied to the 3*, and then to the 
camel, because of the nearness of the latter to the 
former: (M:) or its primary application is to the 
camel: (S, Mgh:) accord, to some, its application 
to the camel is proper; and to the 3*, tropical: 
accord, to others, the reverse is the case: (MF, 
TA:) the pi. is 1*03, as above. (Mgh, TA.) 


One says of a weak person who is in easy 
circumstances, 4333 1 Ah 4 meaning He is unable 
to turn back the 4jl j [or camel bearing a water- 
bag or pair of water-bags,] notwithstanding its 
being heavily burdened by the water that is upon 
it. (M.) — — And the Prophet applied the 
appellation 44 1)03 [The camels bearing water 
for the irrigation of the countries, or the water- 
bags borne by camels for the irrigation of the 
countries,] to (assumed tropical:) the clouds, by 
way of comparison. (TA.) — — 13'33 is also 

applied as an appellation to (assumed tropical:) 
The chiefs of a people; (IAar, Th, T;) as pi. 
of 433; the chief who bears the burden of the 
bloodwits owed by the tribe being likened to the 
camel thus termed. (T, M. *) A Temeemee, 
mentioning a party that had attacked his tribe, 
said, 404 ^4 3 4033 filial meaning 
[We encountered them, and] we slew the chiefs, 
and gave permission to occupy, or to plunder, the 

houses, or tents. (T.) 403 also occurs in a 

trad., in which it is said, 4^ li'33 4033 3 a 
and accord, to some, it is, in this instance, pi. 
of 433 (JM, TA) in the first of the senses 
explained above; so that the meaning is, 
(assumed tropical:) The worst of those who carry 
tidings are those who carry false tidings; such 
persons being likened to the beasts so called, 
in respect of the fatigue that they undergo: (JM:) 
or it is pi. of l 4j3; (JM, TA;) and the meaning is, 
the worst of thoughts are those that are untrue, 
not right, nor tending to good: or it is pi. of 
1 40j; and the meaning is, the worst of relations, 

or recitals, are those that are untrue. (JM.)

The eleventh letter of the alphabet; commonly 
called 3' j, and sometimes 3'j, [and 0, and 0, 
(see 3' j in art. s jj,)] and 3 j, and 3 j. (MF.) It is 
one of the letters termed sjj*jj> [or vocal, i. e. 
pronounced with the voice, and not with the 
breath only]; and of the letters 

termed **U ; because proceeding from the tip of 
the tongue. (TA.) Az says that it is not conjoined 
with in any Arabic word. (TA.) It is 

substituted for j" and for o- 3 ; as in J*jj for Jjj, 
and 3* jj for 3*“=*: and in the Tes-heel it is said 
that it is sometimes interchanged [with i_>“] 
after <*, as in jjj' cjj*- for cii j^.; and after j, 
as in j and jj jj: which interchange, accord, to 

MF, is said to he of the dial, of Kelb; or, as Et- 
Toosee says, of the dial, of 'Odhrah and Kaab and 
Benul-' Ambar. (TA.) — [As a numeral, j denotes

which it is implied that this is the more common 
form, and such is the case now,]) and it is 
allowable to pronounce it 3*0, (Msb,) an

kills such of them as remain [therein]. (K.)

give pain; [the former of these two 

meanings being] from -4jj, i. 

e. idlljl; [the latter of them app. suggested by 
another reading, namely, j in the place 
of ijj'jj; mentioned and thus explained in the 
Ham ubi supra: the poet, therefore, is supposed 
to have meant, upon our state of union, or 
concord, cjh having two contr. 

significations,) have supervened 

concealed enmities, &c.:] or, as some say, the 
reading in the deewan of Artah is -r“'jj, as 
though pi. of 1 4ijj, which is likewise made to 


denote enmity because it is made to enter (s-Oj 3 , 
i. e. ilikii,) into the heart; or which may be 
metaphorically applied to a place of enmity latent 
in the bosom, from the same word as signifying 
the “ place in which are put lambs, or kids, and 
sheep, or goats: ” or, supposing the right reading 
to be i y jj, the poet may very properly mean, 
upon the vacant space between our tents, or 
houses, are carpets (o4^= and -1=5?) spread for us, 
and we sit thereon, near together in the places, 
but with the hearts remote: (idem p. 195:) but 
with the reading j, mentioned above, 
occurs another variation, thus: 4?" j 1115 ^5 ls^; 
meaning, notwithstanding that, between us are 

sayings that give pain. (Idem p. 196.) j lSj 

<5 j J4, occurring in a trad., is said to mean 
(tropical:) Wo to those who go in to lords, or 
princes, and, when they say what is evil, or say 
anything, say, He has spoken truth: such persons 
being likened, in respect of their variable 
conduct, to one of the 1st) jj mentioned above in 
the first sentence of this paragraph; or to sheep, 
or goats, which are thus called in relation to 
the Mjj, i. e. the enclosure to which they repair, 
because they are obsequious to the lords, or 
princes, and follow their steps with the 
submissiveness of sheep or goats to their pastor. 

(TA.) Accord, to El-Muarrij, (TA,) 1 i5jj 

is applied to plants, as meaning Such as have 
become yellow, or red, while having in them 
greenness: (K, TA:) and when they saw the 
colours in carpets and other articles of furniture

that they may signify “ Euripus, fons in altum

a rajiz as meaning “ intoxicated: ” whereas J is 
not in error, but is right, in doing thus; for the u 
is radical accord, to the generality of the 
lexicologists and the authors on inflection, like 
the o“ in 444; and the rajiz above referred to 
elided the u in forming jrjji because he 
imagined it to be augmentative: (MF in art. jj:)

causing such a thing to grow. (Er-Raghib.) [In

that with which the speaker prefaces his speech,

authority whereon to rest, and that contains no 
proof. (TA.) IKh says that p jll is used in relation

three arrows; upon one of which was written “ 
My Lord hath commanded me; ” and upon 
another, “My Lord hath forbidden me; ” and the 
third was blank; (Bd in v. 4;) and they put them

them desired to make a journey, or to accomplish 
a want, (Mgh,) or when he desired to perform

accomplish his purpose; but if that upon which 
was “ Prohibition ” [or “ My Lord hath forbidden 
me ” (Har)] came forth, he refrained; (Mgh,

it forth, and look at it; and if the arrow of 
command came forth, he went to accomplish that 
which he had purposed to do; but if the arrow 
of prohibition came forth, he refrained from that 
which he desired to do: [it is said that] there were 
seven of the arrows thus called with the minister 
of the Kaabeh, having marks upon them, and 
used for this purpose: (Jel in v. 4:) and 
sometimes there were with the man two

autumn,] is called by the Arabs [of the classical

former name because the first rain is therein,

have received the names here given to them from 
Kilab Ibn-Murrah, an ancestor of Mohammad, 
about two centuries before El-Islam. These 
months were lunar; and from this period, with 
the view of adapting their year to the solar, the 
Arabs added a month, which they called i(jAl', at 
the end of every three years, until they were 
forbidden to do so by the Kur-an (ch. ix.): but the 
months still retrograded through the seasons, 
though much more slowly. The abolition of the 
intercalation was proclaimed by Mohammad at

from Jj jl', which is a book belonging to them [i. e. 
the book of Zoroaster]: (PS:) [or from 

the Pers. -43 j, meaning magian, or fire- 
worshipper: and this seems to be its primary 
meaning; as De Sacy says in his “ Chrest. Ar.,” 
2nd ed., ii. 274:] or, accord, to IDrd, it is an 
arabicized word from the Persian »Jjj, (Mgh, 
[thus in my copy, app. for »■ Jj j, in which the » may 
be, as it is in many other instances, an affix 
denoting some kind of relationship,]) or 3 Jjj,

and with an erasure, such as to suggest that the 
original and right reading may be jS Jj j, which 
may be rendered holder of the Zend, but]) which 
is expl. as meaning he [who] asserts his belief in 
the eternity, or the endlessness, of the present 
world: (Mgh, TA:) or it is arabicized from gJ gj i. 
e. woman's religion: (O, K:) or the 

right explanation is this: that it is a term of 
relation to the Jj j, which is the book of Manee the 
Magian, who was in the time of Bahrain the son 
of Hurmuz the son of Saboor [or Shapoor], and 
who claimed to be successor to the Messiah, on 
whom be peace; and, desiring fame, composed 
this book, which he hid in a tree, and then took 
forth: Jj jll, in their language, is “ explanation; ” 
and he meant that this was the explanation of the 
book of Zara- dusht [or Zoroaster] the Persian; 
and in it he held that there are two gods, Light 
and Darkness, Light creating good, and Darkness 
creating evil: (TA:) or, accord, to the “ Mefateeh 
el-'Uloom," 33 j means a follower of Manee, and 
also a follower of Mezdek, who (i. e. Mezdek) 
appeared in the days of Kubadh, and asserted 
that possessions and women were in common, 
and put forth a book which he called Jj j, which is 
the book of the Magians, that was brought by 
Zara- dusht, whom they assert to have been a 
prophet: and the companions of Mezdek 

were named in relation to [this] Jj j; which word, 
being arabicized, was converted into 3^ j: 
(Mgh:) Th says that 3 Jjj is not of the 
[genuine] language of the Arabs; (Mgh, TA;) and 
when the Arabs desire to express the meaning in 
which it is commonly used, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) 
which is one who does not hold any religion, and 
who asserts his belief in the endlessness of time, 
(Msb,) they say J=3 (Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. 
[a deviater from the right religion, or] an 
impugner of religions, (Msb,) and lSjJJ: (Mgh, 
TA:) some say that it is from 4a3 3'; because 
the 3Jj j straitens himself: (L, TA:) an Arab of the 
desert is related to have explained it as meaning 
one who looks much into things, or 
affairs: (Msb:) the pi. is 3lj j and 3 J 3 j; (S, O,

is applied to a man who seeks a thing when he

had slaughtered a camel, and asked them to give 
him some food thereof, and they gave it him: 
then he returned to them, and they said to him 
thus, meaning “ Thou has had thy provision

to one who is invited to a repast when he is 
satiated: or it relates to one suffering from 
indigestion: or P ^ j is the name of a dog; and it 
originated from the fact that a man prepared for 
himself some provision, and was unmindful of it, 
and a dog ate it; and it is applied to him for 
whom there is no share. (Z cited by Freytag uhi

sort of thing of any kind [that is one of a pair or

any two things paired or coupled together,

signifying either one of such two things: (Az, TA:) 
or, accord, to 'Alee Ibn- 'Eesa, a sort of thing 
[absolutely]: (Mgh:) or a sort of thing having its 
like, (El-Ghooree, Mgh, Msb,) as in the case of

Ghooree, Mgh, Msb,) as the moist and the dry, 
and the male and the female, and the night and

though sometimes applied to any sort of thing; 
and to a single thing: (El-Ghooree, Mgh:) or it is 
applied to a single thing only when having with it 
a thing of the same kind; (Mgh, Msb;) u43j 
signifying a pair, or couple, of such things:

a male and a female: (Bd, Jel:) or, accord, to the 
M, jrjj signifies one of a pair or couple: and also 
a pair or couple together: (TA:) and in like 
manner says AO, (Mgh, Msb,) and IKt, and IF:

say, 4 and g4 (S, TA:) and £jj 


J4, meaning [I have] two [sandals]; and u4)j, 
meaning four: (Msb:) or £jj as meaning a 
male and a female [of pigeons] is a phrase which 
should not be used; one to which the vulgar are 
addicted: (TA:) IAmb says, the vulgar are wrong 
in thinking that jrjj signifies two; for the Arabs 
used not to employ such a phrase as £ jj, but 

used to say <J-4I 6? u43j, (Mgh, Msb, 

TA,) meaning a male and a female; (TA;) 
and 44' 04- jj, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning 

the right and the left [of boots]: (TA:) nor did 
they apply the term jrjj to one of birds, like as 
they applied the dual, u43j, to two; but they 
applied the term 4 to the male, and to the 
female: (Mgh, Msb:) Es-Sijistanee, also, says that 
the term jrjj should not be applied to two, 
neither of birds nor of other things, for this is a 
usage of the ignorant; but to every two, u4jj: 
(Msb:) Az says that the grammarians disapprove 
the saying of ISh that jrjj signifies two of any 
things, (Mgh, * TA,) and that 44 0-* u43j 
signifies [Two pairs of boots, or] four [boots]; 
for jrjj with them signifies one [of a pair or 
couple]: a man and his wife [together] are 
termed u43j: and (Hjji 4-“J in the Kur [vi. 144 
and xxxix. 8] means Eight ones [of pairs or 
couples]: the primary meaning of jrjj being that 
first mentioned in this paragraph; (TA:) in the 
Kur xxii. 5 and 1. 7 [it seems to be implied that it 
means pair or couple; but more probably in these 
instances] it means sort, or species: (Bd, Jel:) it is 
also expl. by the word uj 2 [used in this 
last sense]: (T, TA;) in the Kur xxxviii. 58, its 
pi. jrljjl means o' j^' and £'jjl [i. e. sorts, or 
species] of punishment: F explains the sing, 
as meaning ?4-0 ^l* 22 ' J j 2 [a sort, or species, 
of silk brocade and the like]; but his restricting 
the signification by the words » j=>j j £14' i> is 
not right, as is shown by a citation, in the T, of a 
verse of El-Aasha, in which he uses the phrase 

jjj [every sort, or species, of silk 
brocade], as an ex. of £jj in the sense of uj 2 . 

(TA.) [Hence,] A woman's husband: and a 

man's wife: in which latter sense 4 4jj is also 
used; (S, M, A, Mgh, * Msb, K; *) as in a verse 
of El-Farezdak cited in art J jj, conj. 10; (S, Mgh;) 
but it is disallowed by As; (TA;) and the former 
word is the one of high authority, (Mgh, Msb,) 
and is that which occurs in the Kur, in ii. 33 and 
vii. 18, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and in iv. 24, (Mgh, 
TA,) and in xxxiii. 37: (Mgh:) AHat says that the 
people of Nejd call a wife 4 4jj, and that the 
people of the Haram use this word: but ISk says 
that the people of El-Hijaz call a wife £jj; and

says, <i*a' JEj Li [and JJj Li ; as appears from 
what follows], meaning "A. jj U [i. e. I ceased not

[supposing the measure of the pret. to 
be originally "jl*X (Msb, K) and Jjj I [supposing 
the measure of the pret. to be originally cjl*i] : 
(K:) the verb is seldom [in the Msb “ never

mentioned in what precedes. (TA.) The verb in L« 
J' j and J' jj V is used in the manner of in 
governing the noun [which is its subject] in the 
nom. case and the predicate in the accus. case [as 
in Lijls 4j J' j Li, expl. above]; but one may not 
say, Ullaii V] jjj Jl j Li, like as one says, 4 j Li 
X!; for J' j denotes a negation, [meaning he 
did not a thing, or he was not doing &c.,] and Li 
and V denote negation, and two negations 
together denote an affirmation; so that J' j is 
affirmative like u^; and as one may not say, C^

latter being composed of j j J; and this, of j lS J: 
or the incomplete is altered from the complete; 
being made to be with kesr to its medial radical 
letter, [for it is generally held to be from Jjj 
or J j j,] after its having been
