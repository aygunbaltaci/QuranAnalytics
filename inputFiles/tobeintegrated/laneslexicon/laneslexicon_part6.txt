PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

[BOOK I.] 

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 


The nineteenth letter of the alphabet: called 4. 
It is one of the letters termed [or faucial], (L, 

TA,) its place of utterance being the upper part of 
the fauces, near to that of (TA in art. 4,) 
the same place as that of (L, TA,) [from which 
it differs in being pronounced with the voice, for] 
it is of the letters termed [or vocal], (L, 

TA, and K in art. 4,) and of those that are 
termed 444 [q. v.]; one should not reiterate the 
voice in uttering it, so as to exceed what is right, 
nor neglect exactness in respect of its place 
of utterance, so as to render it obscure, but 
should make it thoroughly distinct, and clear: it is 
not an augmentative letter: and [it is said that] it 
is not substituted [for another letter]: (K in 
art. 40 [but this is a mistake; for] it is 
substituted for two letters; for £, in j“-, 
aor. 44, meaning 4=4, aor. 4=4 4, mentioned by 
IJ and several others, (MF, TA,) and in jM- 
for 4“-; (TA in art. 4=4) and for £, in Jil for 0*1, 
mentioned by Ibn-Umm- Kasim and others, (MF, 
TA,) [and in £ 4= for £ 4=,] and in J4> jl for J** j], 
and also in as signifying “ thirst ” and “ the 
clouds. ” (TA in art. 40 — [As a numeral, it 
denotes A thousand.] 4 l JAM 4i. (S,) or 444, 
(Msb, K,) aor. 34 . inf. n. 4^ (S, Msb, K) 
and (Msb, K,) The camels, (S,) or cattle, 

(Msb, K,) came to water, (S,) or drank, (Msb, K,) 
on alternate days; one day and not the next day. 

(S, Msb, K.) Hence, (IAth, TA,) 4*= said of a 

man means He came visiting at intervals of some 
days, or after some days. (AA, IAth, TA.) [See 

also 44: and see J44.] And 4 4“-, 

(Ks, S, Msb, K,) aor. 34 , the verb in this case 
being of the class of tJSS, [but this is contr. to 
analogy, as well as to the derivation,] inf. n. 44, 
with kesr, He came to the people, or party, day 
after day: (Msb:) or, as also 41 ]. he 

came to the people, or party, on alternate days, 
coming one day and not the next: (Ks, S, K:) or he 
came to them once in two days or more. (TA.) 
It is said in a trad., 1 j*i j 1 j 1 j4i [, 44 II 414 4 
Visit ye the sick on alternate days and after 
intervals of two days: (S, TA:) not every day, lest 
he find your visits to be troublesome. (TA. [See 
also art. £=j.]) And you say, j ■44( inf. n. 44), 
meaning I visited him [once] in every week. (A.) 


t 


And hence *4. said of a fever. (Msb.) 44 

4=4 and i 44 signify the same: (S:) you 
say, 4-4 4° 44 The fever came upon him, 
(Msb,) or attacked him, (K,) one day and 
intermitted one day; (Msb, K;) as also 1 <4l and 
i 44 cluil. (K.) [See also 44] — — You say 
also, bic. 4, (S, L, K,) and 1 4', (L, K,) He 
passed the night, or a night, at our abode. (S, L, 
K.) Hence the saying, 44 4-411 ijj [ so accord, to 
the TA, 4=* being understood, accord, to 
the explanation of Meyd, but in the CK, and in 
one of my copies of the S, and in Freytag's Arab. 
Prov. i. 522 , 44,] (S, K,) i. e. Leave thou 
the poetry until some days shall have passed, that 
thou mayest see what will be its result, whether it 
will be praised or dispraised: (Meyd, TA:) or it 
may be from -4 said of a fever, and may thus 
mean, leave thou the poetry to be kept back from 
people, [or to be intermitted,] i. e. do not repeat it 
to people in an uninterrupted manner, lest they 

become weary. (Meyd. [See also art. 4j.]) 

And [hence] 4-4 (T, S, L, Msb, K,) aor. 34 . (L, 
Msb,) inf. n. 4 and 4^ and 4 4 and 4.4, (L,) 
said of food, (L, Msb,) and of dates, or especially 
of flesh-meat as some say, (L,) It remained 
throughout a night, whether it became corrupt or 
not: (L, Msb:) and, said of food, it became altered 
[for the worse] in its odour: (L:) or, said of flesh- 
meat, it became stinking: (T, S, K;) as also 1 44 
(T, K:) and it (a thing) became corrupt. (TA. [See 

also 2 .]) j4AM 44 means The affairs, or 

events, came to, or arrived at, their ends, 
conclusions, latter or last parts or states, issues, 

or results. (S, TA.) And <4 4 04 II 4*, 

aor. &34s inf. n. 4-4 [app. meaning The thing 
came into his mind,] is a phrase mentioned 
by Th. (TA.) 2 444I 4 4-, (S, O,) inf. n. 444 
(K,) He was remiss; or did not exert himself, or 
act vigorously or strenuously; (S, O, K;) in the 
needful affair: (S, O:) [and] so 4*= j. 4 a [if not 
a mistranscription]. (Thus in a copy of the A.) 
[Hence,] 4) 4 1 4 * 4 4 4! 44 (TA,) or 4 
j V \ ,,a \\ 44 (thus in the O,) (tropical:) He wrote 
to him not acquainting him with the great 
number that had perished of the Muslims: (O, 
TA:) a metaphorical mode of expression; as 
though he were remiss, or fell short, in making 


known the essential state of the case. (TA, from a 
trad.) — — And -4 signifies also It (a 
thing) became very corrupt. (TA. [See also 1 , last 
sentence but two.]) — sUill 44 (O, L, *) inf. n. as 
above, (L, K,) He (a wolf) seized the sheep, or 
goat, by its throat, (O, K,) and fixed his canine 
teeth in it: (O:) or attacked the sheep, or goat, 
and broke its neck: and also left it with some 
remains of life in it. (L.) And 4' 4 441 -4 The 
wolf made, or did, mischief among the sheep, or 

goats. (TA.) And [hence, app.,] 44 4 v4, 

(S, O,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He repelled from, or 
defended, the people, or party: (S, O, K:) so say 
Ks and Th. (TA.) 4 3-4' see 1 , in seven places. 

You say also, 14 V His gift will not 

come to us on alternate days, but will come every 

day. (S, O, K. *) And 444 *41 The milch 

camel yielded milk on alternate days. (A.) 
And JAM 4c. I The camels did not yield milk 

every day. (TA.) See again 1 , last sentence 

but two. — JAM 4-4 He watered the camels on 
alternate days: (S, O, Msb: *) from 4“=- [q. v.]. (S, 
O.) — And 44 is said by Th to signify ^ 
[app. meaning He fell upon me in fight]. (TA.) 
5 4iS is app. from 4-4 1 in the sense of 4'4, and 
thus syn. with 4«j signifying He looked to 
the consequence, end, issue, or result, of an 
affair: see its part. n. 444 below.] — — See 
[also] 2 , first sentence. 8 J 4 1 41 se e 44. r. 
Q. 1 4 He acted dishonestly in buying and 
selling. (AA, TA.) 4 A sea dashing so that it goes 
far, or runs, upon the land: (JK, K, TA:) pi. u4.

(TA.) 4^ [a subst., like 4fyli,] A coming (of camels, 
S, O) to water on alternate days; coming to the 
water one day and not the next day: (S, O, K:) or 
after [being kept from it] a day and two nights: or 
pasturing one day and coming to the water 
the next day; and this is the 4^ of the ass. (TA.) 
[And 44! -Gj signifies The coming of camels to 
the water in the second of two nights (as is shown 
by the context of a passage in which it occurs in 
the S and O and K voce 44), or in the second of 
two days.] But the saying of a rajiz, 44 44*3 
44 means And hummarahs [a species of birds] 
whose drinking is every hour or every little while 



2238 Digitized Text Version VI. 1 


[BOOKI.] 


({44 jS). (S, O.) — — Also [for 4i j4] A

Hasan: (S, O:) or at intervals of some days: after 
some days: (AA, IAth: [see also its verb:]) from 
the same word used in relation to camels. (IAth.) 
One says, 4L Isj 2 4 jj [or, accord, to common 
usage, 4, to assimilate it to 4, Visit once 
a week, or at intervals of some days; not 
frequently, or not every day: so thou shalt have 
more love: a prov., respecting which see Freytag's 
Arab. Prov. i. 587 ; where 4 is put for 44-]. (S, O.) 
[See another ex. voce last sentence.] The 
saying of Zeyd-el-Fawaris 4“ 4fc 4 >41 44 
means [The enemy will see me] after the day of 

meeting with him by a day. (Ham p. 732 .) 

And The coming, or attacking, of a fever one day 
and intermitting one day: from the same word 

used in relation to camels. (S, O, Msb.) And 

A tertian fever; that attacks one day and 
intermits one day: (K, TA:) you say *4 4* [a 
tertian fever]; using it as an epithet: (TA:) 
and 4*11 u**-. (Msb in art. 413 .) — — And 
The end; conclusion; latter, or last, part or state; 
issue; or result; syn. 4s4 ; (S, A, MA, O, Msb, K,)

Msb,) of any kind, (S, O,) or of a thing; (K;) as 
also 1 (MA, O, Msb, K,) and 1 44 . (MA.) 
And [hence] 4- means After; syn. 4: thus in the 
phrases yljtfl 4- [After the call to prayer] and 4r 
[After salutation or the salutation]: and one 
says, ls! 4I f j»ll -44 ^Uloll 4 ? [After daybreak,

more commonly, -4: see art. lS>“]. (TA.)

the lower hairs of the chin grow: and the former 
word, what hangs down under the part beneath 
the lower jaw of the ox or cow and of the sheep or 
goat: and the 44 is [what hangs down under 
the part beneath the lower mandible] of the cock 
and of the bull [i. e. the wattle of the cock and the 
dewlap of the bull]: (Lth, TA:) and this is also 


i 

used in relation to an old woman: (Ks, TA:) and, 
metaphorically, in relation to the chameleon: and 
in like manner in relation to the stallion-camel, 
[as meaning the part below the under jaw,] as the

from being deceived: (Mgh:) or of which the

The talk, and actions, and circumstances, 
occurring between the lover and the object of 
love; differing somewhat from y-y^, which is a 
celebrating of the person and qualities of the 
beloved; and from which is a mentioning of 
the state, or condition, of the [himself], and 
of the object of the yyj, and of all the affairs, 
or events, occurring between them two, [in the 
prelude of an ode,] thus including the meaning 
of 3 and being a mentioning of J p: 
accord, to Kudameh, it signifies an inclining to 
foolish and youthful conduct, or a manifesting of 
passionate love, and becoming notorious 
for affections to women: (TA:) or it is the subst. 
from 3 [as such signifying talk, and amatory and 
enticing conduct, with women; or play, sport, 
dalliance, or wanton conduct, and amorous talk, 
with women]; (S, K;) as also [ 3 J*->: (K:) or play,

(Msb:) or, accord, to the leading authorities in 
polite literature, and those who have made the 
language to be their study, [or rather accord, to a 
loose and post-classical usage,] it signifies,

thereof. (MF.) 3p [is, by, rule, the part. n.

speaks, [generally in verse,] of what is 
termed J p [signifying as expl. above, i. e. the 
talk, and actions, and circumstances, occurring 
between the lover and the object of love; 
&c.]; thus used as being a possessive epithet, [not 
as a part. n. of 3 jp, because this differs in 
meaning from J J**,] i. e. it 

signifies [properly] J p p: (TA:) or it means 
displaying amorous gestures or behaviour, and 
foolish and youthful conduct such as is suitable 
to women, with the love, or passionate love, that 
he experiences for them, in order that they may 
incline to him: (Kudameh, TA:) or it is applied to 
a man as meaning a companion of women 
because of his lacking strength to be otherwise: 
from what here follows. (IAar, TA.) — — 
Lacking strength, or ability, to perform, or 


i 

accomplish, things; (IAar, K, TA;) remiss, or 
languid, in respect to them. (IAar, TA.) [Of, 
or relating to, spun thread, or yarn;] the rel. n.

which is when he puts his legs together, [app. 
meaning his fore legs together and so his hind 
legs,] and puts them down together and raises 
them together: (TA:) or i. q. [i. e. a gazelle, of 
any age]: (M in art. for 33=11 is there expl. as

(Msb, MF, TA;) though it seems from what is said

asserted: (MF, TA:) the pi. [of pane.] is <Jj£ and

the sun when high: (M, * K, TA:) or the 6p

wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or by

The taking property that has a price and is 
forbidden, without the permission of its owner,

apply in the case of an animal that has died a 
natural death or not been slaughtered 
according to the law, because it is not property; 
nor in the case of the free person, in like manner; 


nor in the case of the wine of the 
Muslim, because it has not a price; nor in the 
case of the property of him with whom one is at 
war, because it is not forbidden; the saying “ 
without the permission of the owner ” precludes 
the trust, or deposit; and the saying “ without

does not become determinate by its being 
prefixed to another noun, because it is very 
vague: but it is also applied as an epithet to 
a determinate noun which is near to being 
indeterminate; as in jjfc ffjfe Ciixii JjJI 

[The way of those upon whom Thou 
hast conferred favour; the other than, or those 
who are not, the objects of anger; (Kur i. 6 and

the art. J denoting a genus is near to being 
indeterminate, and because when yf occurs 
between two contraries its vagueness becomes 
weakened, (Mughnee, K, *) or altogether departs: 
(K:) or it is here applied as an epithet to a 
determinate noun because it resembles a 
determinate noun in its being prefixed to such a 
noun: (Msb:) Az says that yf is here in the gen. 
case because it is an epithet to and that it 
may be an epithet to [what is technically termed 
in this instance] a determinate noun [as having 
the article Jl prefixed to it] because upll has not

the office of an indeterminate noun; and yf to be 


i 

an epithet of it; not of any other noun; but 
that yf, accord, to some, may be an epithet 
relating to the nouns implied in these 

not having a direct meaning: Akh says that yf 
[with what follows] is a substitute [for uJJI with 
what follows], as though the meaning were 

jt. [the way of those who are not 
the objects of anger]. (TA.) The reading 'yf- is 
also related, on the authority of Ibn-Ketheer, in 
the accus. case, as a denotative of state, [meaning 
they being not the objects of anger,] relating to 
the pronoun governed in the gen. case by the 
prep, [in or by ^1 [I mean] understood; 

or as an exceptive, [accord, to a usage to be 
explained below,] if the favours be interpreted as 
conferred in common upon the two classes of 
persons. (Bd.) — — As it resembles a 
determinate noun in its being prefixed to a 
determinate noun, [as ^ in the above-cited 
passage of the Kur,] some have presumed to 
prefix to it the article Jk but against this it may 
be urged, that its prefixion to a determinate noun 
is not to render the expression determinate, but 
for specification; and J does not imply 

specification. (Msb.) In the following verse 

of Hassan, Jill “kJii ^ Ii ^ »jj*j 11)^ Jij ^ LDi 
UjU the meaning is, [A prophet came to us, who 
appeared in the darkness of night, a director in 
the right way,] and we did not weigh another 
than him with another than the other, i. e., with 

him. (Mughnee.) [kills yfy is a phrase of 

frequent occurrence, meaning Et coetera.]— — 
yf is also used in the sense of cvj [He, or it, is 
not]; as in the phrase 3 yf [The word 

of God is not created], syn. (Az, TA.) 

— — It is also used in the sense of V 
[meaning Not, as used before a participle]; (S, K;) 
and then it is in the accus. case, as a denotative of 
state; (S;) as in the phrase pL jjfc JkLal jia, (s, 
K,) in the Kur [ii. 168, and other places], (S,) i. 
e., kip-L Y kijk=>- [But whosoever is necessitated, 
being hungry, not transgressing the due bounds]. 
(S, K.) — — It is also used as an exceptive, 
(S, Mughnee,) in the sense of 'J [Except; save; or 
but]; (Msb, K;) and then it is put in the same case 
in which the word following YJ would be put in 
the same phrase, (S, Mughnee, Msb, K,) because 
it is originally a qualificative, and its use as an 
exceptive is adventitious: (S:) therefore you 
say yf f jail [The people came, except 

Zeyd]; and fy yf Isii '- i and Ju yf [Not 

any one came to me, except Zeyd]: (Msb, K:) or 
its case depends upon the governing words, so 
that you say fy yf '- i [No one stood, except 
Zeyd], and fy yf kilj [I saw not any, except 
Zeyd]: (Msb:) but Fr says that some of the 


Benoo-Asad and Kuda’ah put yf in the accus. 
case, when used in the sense of Yl, whether the 
phrase before it be complete or incomplete; 
saying kijjfc '- i [Not any one came to me, 

except thou], and kijjfc -A' L. [Not any one 
came to me, except thou]: (S, Msb:) and AA says 
that when yf has the place of Yt, it is put in the 
accus. case. (Msb.) In the saying ’yf <11 Y 
[There is no deity other than God], yf is in the 
nom. case because it is the enunciative of V; but it 
may be put in the accus. case, as meaning YJ. 
(Msb.) When, as an exceptive, it is prefixed to 
an indecl. word [and not preceded by a prep.], it 
may be itself indecl., with fet-h for its 
termination; as in the following verse; J 
Jlfijl Cjlj y j -.-aC- *LiLA. CialV, ^1 jjc. ^jjlill 

[Nought prevented the drinking from it, except 
that a pigeon cooed, upon branches having Jla J, 
which app. means stumps of cut shoots]. 
(Mughnee, K.) [See also an ex. (of i) yf) in a 

verse cited voce -sj.] [It is often used with a 

prep.; as in y*j Without reckoning; (Kur ii. 
208, &c.;) and f yf Without leprosy. (Kur 
xx. 23, &c.)] — 'yf (JK, K) and (JK) J, yf (JK, S) 
signifying The act of altering, or changing, i. 
q. ’yf 1 , (JK,) are substs. from » 'yf ; (S with 
respect to the latter, and K with respect to the

of the willow-kind called] m 3 6 ; not of all trees; 
(AHn, O, K;) accord, to the first Arabs of the 
desert; but this is at variance with what we find 
in the poems of the Arabs; for Ru-beh, for

substituted for 4 [so that the verse should be 
rendered, To God I complain of three qualities, or 
habits, of a friend whom I love, every one of 
which is to me such as angers;] thus says IJ: but 
ISd says that it may be without substitution, 
from 44=16 as expl. in the last sentence of the first 
paragraph of this art.; and thus the meaning may 
he, such as causes me to suffer loss, or detriment,

mother's being pregnant while she was suckling 
him. (S, O.) [But] in a trad, is related the saying, 
(of the Prophet, O) “ Verily I had intended to

The twentieth letter of the alphabet: called *4 
[and ^]. (TA.) It is one of the letters 
termed [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced 

with the breath only, without the voice], and of 
those termed [or labial]: (TA:) it is a radical 
letter, and not augmentative: (TA in <— 

sometimes it is substituted for ■— >; thus in 
the conjunction 4, as in the saying p 4 j >4- 
[“ Zeyd came, then 'Amr ”]; and in f P, “ the well- 
known herb so called [?],” for which they 
say f jill; and in djiiJI, “the grave,” or “ sepulchre,” 
for which they say but using for the 

pi. 4l51i ; and not ‘-“Ip, accord, to IJ, (MF, 
TA,) [unless, app., by poetic license, for] the 
latter pi. is used by Ru-beh. (R and TA in 
art. >-jja..) — j is a particle having no 
government: (Mughnee, * K, * TA:) or it governs 
a mansoob aor.; as in the saying, fiikja 14 j 4 U 
[Thou dost not come to us, that thou mayest talk 
to us]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) accord, to some of the 
Koofees; (Mughnee;) but the truth is, that the 
aor. is here mansoob by u', meant to be 
understood, (Mughnee, TA,) as is said by MF, 
and the like is said by J, (TA,) though the d in 
this case is necessarily suppressed: (I'Ak p. 295 :) 
and it is said (Mughnee, K, TA) by Mbr 
(Mughnee) to govern the gen. case in the saying 
[of Imra-el-Keys], £-443 3a ^44 

[Many a one like thee, even such as was 
pregnant, have I visited by night, and such as was 
suckling]; but the truth is, that what here governs 
the gen. case is 4“ j, meant to be understood; 
(Mughnee, TA;) like as it often is in the case of j, 
as is said in the Lubab. (TA.) — — It occurs used 
in three manners; in one whereof it is an 
adjunctive to an antecedent, and denotes three 

things: one of these is order; and this is of 

two sorts; relating to the meaning, as in 4j p 
j [Zeyd came, and after him ’Amr]; and 
relating to a verbal statement, which is 
an adjoining of an explicit clause to an implicit 
antecedent, as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 
34] “Us U£ Ip pp pt j kij . ti' l Uli j'i [And the 
Devil caused them both to slip, or fall, from it (i. 
e. from Paradise), and ejected them from that 
state of enjoyment in which they were]: 


(Mughnee, K: *) the second thing that it 

denotes when used as an adjunctive to an 
antecedent is proximate sequence, and this is in 
everything [i. e. in every case] according to the 
estimate thereof; (Mughnee, K; *) [meaning, 
according to the relative, or comparative, 
estimate of the time implied; for, as is said in 
an explanation of the words thus rendered, in a 
marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee, “the 
long period is sometimes esteemed short by 
comparison; ” or it may be defined as a particle 
denoting sequence in a case in which is an 
uninterrupted connection between two events;] 
one says ^ 31ja j- jji [Such a one took a wife, 
and, in uninterrupted connection with his doing 
so, a child was born to him,] when there did 
not intervene between the two events aught save 
the period of gestation, (Mughnee, K, *) and so if 
it were a period protracted [beyond the 
usual length]; and you say 3lpa ipull cJi.3 [1 
entered El-Basrah, and, in uninterrupted 
connection with my doing so, Baghdad,] when 
you did not stay in El-Basrah nor between the 
two towns: and this sequence is not necessarily

shown by the correctness of one’s saying fP j\

consequently enter Paradise]; the delay between 
the two events [by death &c.] being well known: 
(Mughnee:) — — [or, accord, to J,] the 
adjunctive 4 occurs in three cases, in the first of 
which it denotes order and proximate sequence 
with association; you say, I33j [I beat 

Zeyd, and next ’Amr]: (S: [the second and third 
of these cases will be mentioned in the course of 

this art:]) and it is said to occur sometimes 

in the sense of 4, (Mughnee, K, * TA, *) denoting 
conjunction in an absolute manner, with delay; 
(TA;) as in the saying [in the Kur xxiii. 14 ] 4511 p 

Uli pull [Then we made the sperm a lump 
of clotted blood, then we made the lump of 
clotted blood a bit of flesh, then we made the bit 
of flesh bones, then we clothed the bones 
with flesh]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) — — and 
sometimes in the sense of j, (Mughnee, K, * TA, 


*) denoting conjunction in an absolute 
manner, without order; (TA;) as in the saying (of 
Imra-el-Keys, TA), JijP Jp.311 jjj [as though 
meaning Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal]; 
(Mughnee, K, TA;) the right reading of which is 
asserted by As to be with j; but it is replied that 
the implied meaning is £*4 4 s Jp.311 jpp o4 
4-3=- [amidst the places of, or pertaining to, Ed- 
Dakhool, and the places of, or pertaining to, 
Howmal; the former places and the latter 
being contiguous; and we may therefore 
understand these words as relating to an 
antecedent command to pause]; this phrase 
being allowable like the saying flilill j 4 i ' 3.A 
jtljlti [1 sat amidst the learned men and 
the devotees]: it has been said that 4 is here 
suppressed before u4, and that 4 is used in the 
place of J!; but this usage of 4 is 

strange: (Mughnee:) the third thing that it 

denotes when used as an adjunctive to an 
antecedent is relation to a cause: (Mughnee, K, * 
TA: *) this is the second of the three cases 
mentioned by J, who says, (TA,) it is when what 
precedes it is a cause of what follows it; and 
it denotes adjunction and proximate sequence 
without association; as in the sayings 
[He beat him, and he consequently wept,] 
and [He beat him, and consequently 

pained him,] when the beating is the cause of the 
weeping and of the pain: (S, TA:) used in this 
manner, i. e. to denote relation to a cause, it is 
generally such as adjoins a proposition, as in [the 
saying in the Kur xxviii. 14 ] -*4° >• ‘ jpp 

[And Moses struck him with his fist, and 
consequently killed him]; or a qualificative, as in 
[the saying in the Kur lvi. 52 - 54 ] 

a31c jjjjlia [Shall 

surely be eating from trees of Zakkoom, and 
consequently filling therefrom the bellies, and 
drinking thereon of hot water]. (Mughnee, K.) — 
— Another manner in which it is used [the 
second of the three manners before mentioned 
(Mughnee)] is as a connective of an apodosis, i. 
e., of the complement of a conditional clause, 
(Mughnee, * K, * TA,) when this is of a kind not 
fit to be itself conditional, i. e., to be a 



[BOOKI.] 


Digitized Text Version VI. 1 2335 


e_a 


protasis. (Mughnee.) It is thus used when the 
complement is a nominal proposition; as in [the 
saying in the Kur vi. 17 ] 3^ Jc. j$i Jpp “dkkk; jlj 
j“A fi Is -" 1 [And if He cause good to betide thee, He 
is able to do everything]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) this 
is the third of the three cases mentioned by 
J, who says, (TA,) this is when it is used for the 
purpose of inception, in the complement of a 
conditional clause; as in the saying u\ 

cjjli [if thou visit me, thou wilt be a 
welldoer]; in which what follows A is a new 
proposition, grammatically independent of what 
precedes it, one part thereof governing another; 
for cjjl is an inchoative, and is its 

enunciative; and the proposition has become a 

complement by means of the (S, TA:) or, 

(K,) secondly, (Mughnee,) the complement may 
be a verbal proposition, like the nominal, and it is 
one of which the verb is aplastic; as in [the saying 
in the Kur xviii. 37 and 38 ] VU ktL 331 Li jjL u! 
33 ji 3 15 -“**^ ^33 [if thou seest me to 

be possessing less than thou in respect of wealth 
and children, it may be that my Lord may give 
me]; and [the saying in the Kur ii. 273 ] u! 
u ? 4 13*A 34“ [If ye make apparent the 

alms, very good, as a thing, is it, i. e. the doing 
so]: (Mughnee, K:) - — or, (K,) 

thirdly, (Mughnee,) the verb of the complement 
may be one belonging to a new proposition, 
grammatically independent of what precedes it, 
as in [the saying in the Kur iii. 29 ] “dll u! 

4.44L [if ye love God, follow ye me]: (Mughnee, 

K:) or, (K,) fourthly, (Mughnee,) the verb of 

the complement may be a pret., as to the letter 
and as to the meaning; either properly, as in [the 
saying in the Kur xii. 77 ] <1 313“ 3a 3j"3 3 

Ifia [if he steal, a brother of his hath stolen 
before]: or tropically, as in [the saying in the Kur 
xxvii. 92 ] jLlI ^ j ^4^ ilk jij [And 
whoever shall have done that which is evil, their 
faces are inverted in the fire of Hell], this [latter] 
verb being used as though signifying what has 
already happened to denote the certain assurance 

of the event’s happening: (Mughnee, K: *) 

fifthly, when the —1 is coupled with a particle 
relating to futurity; as in [the saying in the Kur v. 

39] - ' J -dll u 3 . kijj 

[Whoever of you revolteth from his religion, God 
will bring a people whom He loveth]; and in [the 
saying in the Kur iii. 111 ] » jj&j 3^ 34- 1 3*4 lij 

[And what ye do of good, ye shall not be 
denied the reward of it]: (Mughnee: omitted in 
the K; as is also what here next follows:) — — 
sixthly, when the —1 is coupled with a particle 
to which is peculiarly assigned the first place in a 


proposition, as in the saying, AtJ 3A Lllii jla 
Ll $3 44 L jISj ijp. [a verse similar in itself, and 
probably in its sequel (which is not quoted), to 
one by Rabee’ah Ibn-Makroom (in Ham p. 29 ), 
app. meaning And if I perish, many a one having 
rage in his bosom, whose fire kindled against me 
almost flames with a vehement flaming; 3 *=“ 
being for 3 A 33]; for mj is meant to be 
understood, and to it peculiarly belongs the first 

place in the proposition: (Mughnee:) the —1 

must also be used when the complement of a 
conditional clause is imperative; as in the 
saying j£la 4 j dli jki 3 [if Zeyd treat thee with 
honour, treat thou him with honour]: or 
prohibitive; as in the saying ^ 4 j klijSL 3 [if 
Zeyd treat thee with honour, treat not thou him 
with contempt]: or negative, either by means 
of 31 [as in an ex. above] or by means of 4 as in 
the saying lis 14 j Cii jSi 3 [if thou treat Zeyd 
with honour, he does not treat thee with 
contempt]: (TA:) — — when the verb of 
that complement is an aor., affirmative, or 
negative by means of V, the may be introduced 
or omitted: in the former case you may say 3 
kUjkli ^43““ meaning Lit 3“i Iii [i. e. If thou treat 
me with honour, I will treat thee with honour]; 
and you may say Ll3 ur“ JL 3 [which is 
the more usual] if you do not make it [i. e. -A* jSI] 
the enunciative of a suppressed inchoative [i. e. 
of Li]; and in the case of the negative by means 
of V you may say “4“»i iL ^ u! [If thou treat 
me with honour, I will not treat thee with 
contempt; and you may omit the —1 as is 

more usual]: (TA:) and sometimes the — 1 is 

suppressed in the case of necessity in verse [on 
account of the metre]; as in the saying, 
Ujkij AJ 1 I CitUaJI [whoso doth those deeds 
that are good, God will recompense them, i. e., 
the deeds], (Mughnee, K,) meaning 3Ula : (K:) or, 
(Mughnee, K,) accord, to Mbr, who disallows this 
even in verse, (Mughnee,) the right reading is j* 
ijii jlkil Jkaj [whoso doth that which is 

good, the Compassionate will recompense it]; 
(Mughnee, K;) and it is absolutely disallowable: 
(K:) or it occurs in chaste prose, (Mughnee, K, *) 
accord, to Akh; (Mughnee;) and hence the saying 
[in the Kur ii. 176 ] 3-LIj 4 IjA- Lijj 3 

3«3^l j [If he leave wealth, the legacy shall be to 
the two parents and the nearer of 
other relations]; and the trad, respecting that 
which one has picked up, or taken, of property 
that has been dropped, j-UIkl 'jj *lk uL 

Ih [And if the owner thereof come, restore thou it 
to him; and if not, or otherwise, benefit thyself by 
it]: (Mughnee, K:) — — when the verb of the 


complement of a conditional clause is a pret. as 
to the letter but future as to the meaning 
intended [yet not importing certainty, so that it is 
not like the saying in the Kur xxvii. 92 , cited 
above], the “A may not be prefixed to it; as in the 
saying LiiijSi 4441 3 [if thou treat me with 
honour, I will treat thee with honour]: and 
likewise when it is pret. as to the [proper] 
signification but [an aor. as to the letter and] 
future as to the meaning intended; as in the 
saying jLlI jk 4 4 uulkl 3 [if thou become a 
Muslim, thou wilt not enter the fire of Hell]. 
(TA.) — — And as the thus connects the 
apodosis with its protasis, so it connects the like 
of the apodosis with the like of the protasis; as in 
the saying f*j-? 31a 344 ^ill [who comes, or 
shall come, to me, for him is, or shall be, a 
dirhem]: by its being introduced in this case, one 
understands what the speaker means, that 
the obligation to give the dirhem is a 
consequence of the coming: otherwise the saying 
would be ambiguous. (Mughnee.) Thus also it 
occurs after a clause commencing with the 
conditional particle 131, q. v. (Mughnee in art. 131; 
&c.) — — It also occurs in the cases here 
following, prefixed to an aor., which is mansoob 
by means of 3, meant to be understood, (S, TA, 
and I’Ak p. 295 ,) but necessarily suppressed: 

(I’Ak ibid.:) thus in the complement of a 

command; (S, TA, and I'Ak p. 296 ;) as in 

[Come thou to me, that I may treat thee 
with honour]: (I’Ak ibid.:) [and] you say ^ jj 
LLIJ o*«kL [visit thou me, that I may do good to 
thee]; (S, TA;) to which J adds, you do not 
make the visiting to be the cause of the doing 
good; what you [would] say being, it is of my way 
to do good always; but [there seems be 
an omission here in the copies of the S, for, as] IB 
says, if you make to be marfooa, [not 

mansoob,] saying “43 j-AL, [the meaning is, for 
I will do good to thee, for] you do not make the 
visiting to be the cause of the doing good: (TA:) 
the demand, however, in this and similar 
cases, must not be indicated by a verbal noun, 
nor by an enunciative; for when it is so indicated, 
the aor. must be marfooa; as in Lljl) ^ 

[Be silent, then I will do thee good]; and in 
3“L1I 443 AykiJI [The discourse is sufficient for 
thee, so the people shall sleep]: (I'Ak p. 296:) — 
— also in the complement of a prohibition; (S, 
and I'Ak p. 296;) as in lij 4 V [Beat 

not thou Zeyd, for he may beat thee, or lest he 
beat thee]: (I'Ak ibid.:) — — and in the 
complement of a prayer; as in 33ki Ma 43 ~kl ^ j 
[My Lord aid me, so that I may not be left

helpless]: (I'Ak ibid.:) — — and in the 

complement of an interrogation; (S, and I'Ak p. 
296;) as in MU jSja I jj j 3 * [Wilt thou treat 

Zeyd with honour, that he may treat thee with 
honour?]: (I'Ak ibid.:) — — and in the 

complement of a petition with gentleness; (S, and 
I'Ak p. 296;) as in I Vi [Wilt 

thou not alight at our place of abode, that thou 

mayest obtain good?]: (I’Ak ibid.:) and in 

the complement of a demanding with urgency 
the performance of an action; as in l 4 ikji Ujju V jl 
[Wherefore dost thou not come to us, that thou 

mayest talk to us?]: (I'Ak p. 296:) and in the 

complement of an expression of wish; as in J ciul 
Mli [Would that I had wealth, that I 

might give alms thereof]: (I'Ak ibid.:) and in 

the complement of an expression of hope, in 
like manner as in the case next before mentioned, 
accord, to the Koofees universally; as in the 
saying in the Kur [xl. 38 and 39] 
jlUa UilyMUt UjULI [May-be I shall reach the 
tracts, or the gates, the tracts, or the gates, of the 
heavens, so that I may look], accord, to one 
reading: (I'Ak p. 298:) — -b29- and in the 
complement of a negation, (S, and I'Ak p. 295,) i. 
e., of a simple negation; as in MjMUs UmIj U [Thou 
dost not come to us, that thou mayest talk to us; 
a saying mentioned before, in the first of the 
remarks on this particle]. (I'Ak ibid.) — b30- It 
is also prefixed as a corroborative to an oath; as 
in Mijj «4 [which may be rendered Now by thy 
might, or nobility, &c.], and MCjji [Now by thy 
Lord]. (TA.) — b3i- The third manner in which 
it is [said to be] used is when it is redundant, so 
that its being included in a saying is like its being 
excluded: but this usage is not affirmed by Sb: 
Akh allows its being redundant in the enchoative, 
absolutely; mentioning the phrase ^ ja Ml j^i [as 
though meaning Thy brother, he has been found; 
but 1 is app. meant to be understood, so that the 
phrase should be rendered, fully, this is thy 
brother, and he has been found]: Fr and ElAalam 
and a number of others restrict its being 
allowable to the cases in which the enunciative is 
a command, as in the saying, jtSila jVji. ajjISj 
and in the saying, Mlb is'J jlika Ciil or 

a prohibition, as in the saying Mi 4 j; but 

those who disallow its being so explain the first of 
these three exs. by saying that the implied 
meaning is otj*- ??», [so that the saying should 
be rendered, fully, Many a woman is there saying, 
This is Khowlan (the tribe so named), therefore 
marry thou their young woman; and in like 
manner the implied meaning of the third ex. is li* 
Mi This is Zeyd, therefore do not thou 
beat him;] and the implied meaning of the 


second ex. is >= 3 li [so that the saying should 
be rendered, fully, Look thou, and look to what 
result thereof thou wilt eventually come,] 
the former being suppressed, and its implied 
pronoun, i -^i, expressed: the saying Mi*i UiSk lily 
tj- j^-ii MIJi [meaning And when I perish, on 
the occasion thereof manifest thou impatience, or 
grief, &c., the second ( -i being redundant,] is an

but jja as quasi-pass, of [i. e. as intrans.] is of

accord, to AZ, (M,) i. e. he was smitten by a ^ 
[or trial, &c.,] so that his wealth, or property, or 
his intellect, departed: and likewise he was tried, 
or tested: (S:) and accord, to AZ, one says, of a 
man, ; jisi, [if not a mistranscription for as 
above,] with damm, meaning (TA:) [and -dja 
has also as an inf. n.:] it is said in the Kur 
[xx. 41], 14 jda illjjaj (s) i. e. And we tried thee with 
a [severe] trying: or the noun in this instance is 
pi. of 0% or of '<&, formed by disregard of the », 
like and jj 4 which are [said to be] pis. 
of » and » ji; so that the meaning is, we tried 
thee with several sorts of trying: (Bd:) or, as some 
say, and we purified thee with a [thorough or 
an effectual] purifying [like that of gold, or silver, 
by means of fire]: (TA:) [in many instances] <ua, 
aor. jja, [inf. n. u^,] signifies He tried, or tested, 
him; whence, in the Kur ix. 127, means 

They are tried, or tested, by being summoned to 
war, against unbelievers or the like; or, as some 
say, by the infliction of punishment or of some 
evil thing. (M.) fSL-iii in the Kur [lvii. 13], 
means Ye caused yourselves to fall into trial and 
punishment. (TA.) And ^ f* 3 , in the Kur 
xxix. 1, is expl. as meaning While they are not 
tried in their persons and their possessions so 
that he who has true faith may be known from 
others by his patient endurance of trial. (T.) And 
the saying, in a trad., ^ means 

[Verily ye shall be tried, or tested, in the graves 
by] the questioning of [the two angels] Munkar 
and Nekeer. (TA.) [See also which is said to 
be an inf. n., and syn. with meaning or

the intrans. v. ilna), meaning 0>*=s as well as a 

pass. part, n.] And (M, TA,) inf. n. 6^, 

(TA, [or perhaps uj^, as in the next following 
sentence]) also signifies He made him (a man, M) 
to turn from, or quit, (M, TA,) the predicament in 
which he was, (M,) or the right course: (TA:) 
whence, in the Kur [xvii. 75], C P 1 j u jj 

jt (M, TA) i. e. [And verily they were 
near to] their making thee to turn [from that 
which we had revealed to thee]: thus this

seduced him; or tempted him: thus it may often 
be well rendered, agreeably with what next 
precedes and what next follows, and with 
explanations of its act. part. n. and of ^.] And 
one says, J'-JI lA aor. jjja, inf. n. uj^, 

[or perhaps J&, as in the next preceding

or attracted, to it, men, or mankind: and 0^

declined [or was made to decline] from [the right 
way in] his religion. (Msb.) And -dja, aor, inf. 
n. i and uj^, (M, K,) He, or it induced in him 
admiration, or pleasure; (M, * K, * TA;) as also 
j ajjsI [respecting which see what here follows]: 
(M, K:) and one says, of a woman, -d£a, (T, S,) 
meaning [She enamoured him; or captivated his 
heart; i. e.] she bereaved him of his heart, or 
reason, (<&-, [thus in several copies of the S, in 
one of my copies -^w,] and [so affected him that] 
he loved her; (S;) as also 1 (t, S;) the former 

of the dial, of El-Hijaz, and the latter of the dial, 
of Nejd; (T, S; *) but 1 4j2al, (x, S,) or (M,) 
was disallowed by As, (T, S, M,) and he paid no 
regard to a verse mentioned to him as an ex. 
thereof, (T,) [or] he ignored a verse cited to him 
as an ex. of the pass. part. n. from an » _}>=>• jl of 
Ru-beh, not knowing it therein; (M;) most of the 
lexicologists, however, allow both: (T:) Sb says 
that “dSa signifies he put [or occasioned] in 
him <da; and ; -^1, he caused to come to him 
[or to affect him]; (M;) or he said that the latter 
means he made him to be 0)^: (TA voce _>=>•:) 
and one says also, of a man, jS and ; 
[both meaning He was enamoured by the 
woman]. (T.) — — And one says also, of a 
man, aor. j^a, inf. n. meaning He 

desired [i. e. the committing of adultery or

women or the women; as also j?. (M, K,

conflict, or discord, or the like,) with another]. 
(TA in art. see 3 in that art.) 4 j^al see 
1, former half, in two places: and also in the latter 
half, in four places. 5 1^1

another, ever]. — — see 5 in art. 

where it is said to be syn. with 8 see 1, 

former half, in four places: and also in the latter 
half, in two places. ujs A sort, or species; and a 
state, or condition; syn. (T, M, K,) and ji, 

(T, K,) and uJS, (M, K,) and 3 -v (T, K.) Hence the 
saying of ’Amr Ibn-Ahmar El-Bahilee, ^ ^>j 
j lijj [Either against a soul 
or for it; life being of two sorts, or conditions, 
sweet and bitter; 'j* being for ji]; (T; and 
the latter hemistich, without the incipient j, is 
cited in the K;) thus as related by some: but as 
related by Aboo-Sa’eed [As], he said i. 
e. and as related by Aboo- ’Amr Esh- 

Sheybanee, [with kesr]; and [he seems to 
have held that the poet meant two-sided; for] he 


says that ; signifies (T.) — — 

And (K, TA, [in the CK, 

erroneously, jlSall,]) dual of (TA,) signifies 
The first and last parts of the day; or the early 
part of the morning and the late part of the 
evening: (K, TA:) because they are two states, 
or conditions, and two sorts. (TA.) 0^: see the 
next preceding paragraph. A burning with 
fire. (T.) — — And The melting of gold and 
of silver (K, TA) in order to separate, or 

distinguish, the bad from the good. (TA.) 

And [hence, or] from signifying “ he 

melted,” (T,) or from that verb as signifying “ he 
put into the fire, “(Msb,) gold, and silver, “ for 
that purpose,” (T, Msb,) it signifies A trial, or 
probation; (IAar, T, S, M, K, TA;) and affliction, 
distress, or hardship; (TA;) and [particularly] an 
affliction whereby one is tried, proved, or tested: 
(IAar, T, S, K, TA:) this is the sum of its 
meaning in the language of the Arabs: (T, TA: *) 
or the trial whereby the condition of a man may 
be evinced: this, accord, to Zj, may be 
the meaning in the Kur v. 45: (M:) or a mean 
whereby the condition of a man is evinced, in 
respect of good and of evil: (Kull:) [hence it 
often means a temptation:] and j signifies 
the same as (S, M, K,) meaning a trial: (K:) 
the pi. of is J&. (Msb.) It proceeds from God 
and from man: (Er-Raghib, TA:) [there are many 
instances of its proceeding from God in the Kur; 
for ex., in xxxvii. 61,] 0 * 4 ^ ^is UJ 1 . e. 

[Verily we have made it to be] a trial [to 
the wrongdoers] is said in relation to the tree Ez- 
Zakkoom; the existence of which they 
disbelieved; for when they heard that it comes 
forth in the bottom of Hell, they said, Trees 
become burned in the fire; then how can they 
grow therein? (M.) [And hence] it signifies also 
Punishment, castigation, or chastisement. (T, M, 
K.) And Slaughter: (T:) and civil war, or conflict 
occurring among people: (M:) and slaughter, and 
war, and faction, or sedition, among the parties 
of the Muslims when they form themselves into 
parties: (T:) and discord, dissension, 

or difference of opinions, among the people. 
(IAar, T, K.) A misleading; or causing to err, or go 
astray: (T, K:) [seduction; or temptation: or 
a cause thereof; such as] the ornature, finery, 
show, or pomp, and the desires, or lusts, of the 
present life or world, whereby one is tried: (T:) 
and wealth, or children; (T, K, TA;) because one 
is tried thereby: (TA:) and women; than whom, 
the Prophet said, there is no more harmful to 
men: (T:) and a cause of one's being pleased with 
a thing; (T, M, K;) as in the saying fjall UUAj V 
[in the Kur x. 85, i. e. Make not us to be a

A sin, a crime; or an act of disobedience for which 
one deserves punishment. (M, K.) And Disgrace,

devil's prompting, or suggesting, of some evil 
idea]: 3-^, The being turned from the [right] 

road: cjUill The being questioned in the 
grave [by the two angels Munkar and 
Nekeer]: The sword: and

the act. part. n. of the trans. v. and as such]

M,) from the truth: (S:) hence the saying in the 
Kur [xxxvii. 162], 0*4% 3% 6*' (T, S, * M, *) 

which, accord, to Fr, means, Ye have not power 
[over him] to cause him to err, except him 
against whom it has been decreed that he shall 
enter the fire [of Hell]; being made trans. by

though thou purchasedst him and freedst

captive from the state in which he was, though 
j cjjala is better in this sense: as to the 
reading f* j2ii [in the Kur ii. 79], Aboo-Mo'adh 
says, it means Ye purchase them from the enemy

says, means ye contend with them who are in

from her, she became separated from him by that

two horses running for a wager. (O, * TA.)

38, and Kull in p. 275, and TA; *) relating to 
a case into which a man has brought himself: 
(Kull:) this is said to be the meaning when the

K:) or A A is like AA!; but the latter is so 
termed in consideration of its befalling; and the 
former is so called in consideration of the 
sentence, or decree, respecting it: (B:) [this is 
said in books on the law, in explanation of the 
opinion of Aboo-Haneefeh, as opposed to that of 
Esh-Shafi’ee: for] accord, to Esh-Shafi’ee, these 
two terms are alike; (L, TA;) but accord, to Aboo- 
Haneefeh, the difference between -AA 
and AA is like the difference between heaven 
and earth: (TA:) this distinction, however, 
is founded upon contested derivations of the two 
terms: (Kull p. 276:) and it is said that wherever 
the phrase All AA occurs, it means 4 AJ.

prescribed, [a thing as a statute, or an ordinance,

these goats,” and they were incompliant to him; 
so he called to the people, “Collect yourselves 
together; ” and they did so; and he said, “Take 
ye them as spoil; but I do not allow to any one 
more than one; ” therefore they separated them

and ?? (K, TA,) He feared; or was, or became, in 
fear, afraid, frightened, or terrified; (S, O, Msb, 
K, TA;) and so J, £ ji>: (TA in art. £ jj:) you 
say, 4 £ ji he feared him, or it; or was, or 
became, in fear, &c., of him, or it: (MA, Msb, TA:) 
accord. to Er-Raghib, £ja signifies a 
shrinking, and an aversion, that comes upon a 
man, from a thing causing fear or fright; and is a 
kind of £ j?- [q. v.]; and one should not say ciio ja 
■dll 0* like as one says <4 — or, as Mbr says, in 
the “ Kamil,” its primary signification is the 
fearing, or being in fear or afraid or frightened or 
terrified: then, by a metonymical application, 
it signifies a people's going forth quickly to repel 
an enemy, or the like, that has come upon them 
suddenly; and this meaning has 


become [conventionally regarded as] proper. 
(TA.) — — £ ja signifies also The seeking, or 
demanding, aid, or succour: (Az, K, TA:) and the 
aiding, or succouring; (Az, S, O, K, TA;) this latter 
being likewise a signification of J, g) jaj: (S, O:) an 
ex. of the former word (S, O, TA) in the latter 
sense (O, TA) occurs in the saying of the Prophet 
to the Ansar, ik. jjffi j ^jall it jjjSU <41 
[Verily ye are many on the occasion of aiding, or 
succouring, and ye are few on the occasion 
of coveting, or greed]; (S, O, TA;) or in this saying 
the implied meaning may be, on the occasion of 
men's betaking themselves to you in fear ( £ ja it 
Ajl u-'dll) i n order that ye may aid or succour 
them [which is virtually the same as their seeking 
your aid or succour]: (TA:) thus [it is said] £ja 
has two contr. significations: (K:) and both of 
these significations are expressed by the verb £ ja: 
(O:) you say <4! ^ ja and ^ ja; (K in 

continuation of what has been last cited 
therefrom above, and TA; [app. meant to indicate 
that both of these phrases signify he sought, or 
demanded, aid, or succour, of him; and he aided, 
or succoured, him; or that the former phrase has 
the former signification; and the latter phrase, 
the latter signification; though accord, to the TK, 
both phrases have the former signification, and 
the former phrase has also the latter 
signification;]) but you should not say <^ja, 
(K, TA,) i. e. like (TA:) [or] from £ jail as 
signifying “ fear,” or “ fright,” you say Cic. ja 
and >44 cjc. ja ; [app. meant to indicate that the 
former phrase signifies I betook myself to thee in 
fear, which is a meaning thereof well known, and 
nearly agreeing with an explanation of the verb 
followed by <4! which will be found below in this 
paragraph; and that the latter phrase signifies I 
feared thee, or I was, or became, in fear, &c., of 
thee, the only meaning, of this phrase, for which 
I find any explicit authority, and one for which I 
have given three authorities in the first sentence 
of this art.;] but you should not say 4c. ja: (S: 
[thus in my copies, 4c. ja, not 4c ja:]) or j; ja 
44! signifies he sought, or demanded, of them, 
aid, or succour; and f4ja and <4° ja signify he 
aided, or succoured, them, syn. [in the 

CK js-AI] and <4j*A like | 4^ jai; (K, TA:) 
accord, to IB, <4 ja meaning <j£il is 

originally <1 Cic. ja [primarily signifying I feared, 
or became in fear &c., for him]; then the J was 
dropped; for one says 4c ja and <1 aJc ja : (TA:) 
or £ ja, like c J*, signifies j*-=jjl; (K: [thus in the 
copies of the K, and hence in the TA, app. a 
mistranscription for j. ' - vri 4 , he sought, or 
demanded, aid, or aid against an enemy:])

El- 'As; (K, TA;) the city of y** in old times; as 
also iaLLLijll: (Msb:) and sjlojll. (TA.) 3“® l y*

from another thing, in a bad, or corrupt, manner. 
(Msh.) One says, (s, O, Msb,) or 

U y (K,) The fresh ripe date came 

forth from its skin; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also 
4 (IDrd, O, K:) and in like manner yi is 

said of anything as meaning it came forth from

wickedly, vitiously, or immorally]. (S, O, K. [See 
also y* below.]) y y* (in the Kur [xviii. 
48], O, TA) means He departed (jji.) from the 
command of his Lord: (Th, S, O, K:) or from the 
obeying [of the command] of his Lord: (Fr, O, 
TA:) and Akh says that this phrase is like y 
jUijI, (s, O,) meaning <l$i-« y, (S,) or <l£i y 
fU-Ul; hut Th says that there is no need of 
this [explanation]: or, accord, to AO, it means he 
declined, or deviated, from obeying the command

he declined, or deviated: (K:) and hence the 
saying, Jj4=1I y ys . jll cjaLa i. e. [The ridden 
camels] declined [from the right direction of the

a believer: thus in the Kur xlix. 11. (TA.) — —

O, Msb, K:) unless as signifying [simply] A going 
forth, or a departure, it is said to he a word 
unknown before Ellslam, and to have become so 
much used in its legal acceptation as to be, when 
so used, conventionally regarded as proper (MF, 
TA:) [thus used,] it signifies a going forth, or 
departure, from the right way, (K, TA,) which is 
said to be the primary meaning, (TA,) or from the 
way of truth; (K, TA;) or from the truth, or 
that which is right, as in the phrase y ?! <jjj, (O, 
K, [in the CK 3*41, a strange mistake,]) in the Kur

the command of God; (Lth, O, K;) and an 
inclining to disobedience; (Lth, O;) or also 
disobedience [itself]; (K;) or i. q. [meaning 
as above; or transgression; or unrighteous, 
sinful, wicked, vitious, or immoral, conduct]: (O, 
K:) it is said by El-Isbahanee to he a more general 
term than jaS; applying to few sins, misdeeds, 
transgressions, or acts of disobedience, or to little 
thereof; and also, to many, or much thereof; hut 
is commonly known as applying to the latter: and 
it is related on the authority of Malik that in the 
Kur vi. 146 it means such as is slaughtered: (TA:) 
[being used as a subst.,] it sometimes has a ph, 
which is 3 yi- (TA.) y* (Lth, O, K) and 
1 344, (Lth, S, O, K,) applied to a man, Always 

characterized hy y ?. (Lth, S, O, K.) 3*44 

means y^ 4fi 4 [O thou 3**4]; (S, O, K;) like 4 
etui., meaning y 4 tj I 4 being determinate,

TA;) [transgressing, or a 

transgressor; unrighteous, sinful, wicked, vitious, 


or immoral;] mostly applied to one who has 
taken upon himself to observe what the law 
ordains, and has acknowledged its authority, and 
then fallen short of observance in respect of all, 
or of some, of its ordinances: and when the 
person fundamentally, or utterly, an unbeliever is 
thus termed, it is because he falls short of 
observing the ordinance that the intellect 
renders obligatory on him and that the natural 
constitution with which he was created in his 
mother's womb requires to he conceded; hence 
the believer is contrasted with him in the Kur 
xxxii. 18; so 344 is a more general term than jst£; 
and £14= is a more general term than 3**4: (El- 
Isbahanee, TA:) accord, to IDrd, (O,) the y 4 is 
thus called because of his divesting himself, or 
becoming divested, of good: (O, K:) the word has 
not been heard in the speech of the people of the 
Time of Ignorance, (IAar, S, O, Msh, K,) nor in 
their poetry, (IAar, S, O, K,) though it is an 
Arabic word, (IAar, S, O, Msh, K,) and a chaste 
one, and the Kur-an has used it: (IAar, Msh:) the 
pi. is <4=4 and 3'-“*®: (Msb:) 3*44, [pi. of <4*44,] 
applied to women, signifies [generally 

meaning adulteresses, or fornicatresses]. (TA.) - 
— The five animals, or living things, ( cj4l

much, or frequent, noxiousness and harmfulness, 
so that they may be killed in the case of freedom 
from <4 jkl and in the state of 43=4, and in prayer, 
which is not rendered ineffectual thereby: 
(Msh:) or because of their being out of the pale of 
inviolability: or, as some [unreasonably] say,

application; whence the saying ^4 cfy-^a 
J^=>a [excess without excellence]; (Mgh;) and 
hence the rel. n. 4 is formed from it: (Er- 

Raghib, Msb, TA;) [see this last word, one of 
the explanations of which shows that a particular 
meaning of 3 is the qualify of busying oneself 
with that which does not concern him:] accord, to 
Er-Raghib, signifies an excess [in respect of 
a property or qualify, or of an acquisition,] above 
moderateness; and this is of two sorts; such as is 
commended, as the J*^a of knowledge, or science 
; and such as is discommended, as the J*-=a of 
anger at that whereat it is not necessary: but ufc=a 
is more used in relation to that which 
is commended; and [the pi.] 3 in relation to 
that which is discommended, when the former is 
used of an excess [in respect of some attribute, of 
our of two things above the other, it is of three 
sorts; of kind, as of the animal kind above 
the vegetable kind; and of species, as of man 
above other animals; and of the individual, as of 
one man above another; the first and second of 
which three are essential attributes, such that he 
who is deficient in [either of] them cannot 
do away with his deficiency and acquire J*^a, as, 
for instance, the horse, and the ass, which cannot 
acquire the excellence fyh^) of the 

human being; but the third may be accidental, 
such that the way may be found to acquire it, and 
of this sort are ability, wealth, rank or 
station, and power: and it signifies also any gift 
whereof the giving to the recipient thereof is not 
obligatory: [i. e. a free gift, or gratuity; and an act 
of bounty or grace; a favour; a benefit; and 
bounty as an abstract term;] as in the saying [in 
the Kur iv. 36], -dtia j? ^ 1 jlLLil j [And ask ye God 
of his free gift, or of his bounty, or (as expl. in the 
Ksh and by Bd) of his exhaustless treasures]; and 
in the saying in the Kur [v. 59 and lvii. 21 and lxii. 
4], C ^ J^a [That is the free gift of 

God; He giveth it to whom He willeth]; 
which comprises the three sorts of excellences 
(JjUia) [mentioned above]: thus says Er-Raghib: 


El-Muna- wee says, [explaining one of its 
meanings,] in the “ Towkeef,” that it is the 
commencing, or originating, of an act 
of beneficence without an efficient cause [i. e., 

app., not by reason of any obligation]. (TA.) 

Also A portion remaining, (K, TA,) of a thing, 
such as food &c., and of water in the leathern 
water-bag, and of wine or beverage in the vessel; 
(TA;) and 4 ^i^a and 4 > =a signify the same, (K, 

TA,) or a redundant portion (S and O and Msb in 
explanation of these two words) of a thing: (S, 
O:) whence the saying of the vulgar, 4 4 

i. e. The remaining portion of the wine or 
beverage [is for the excel-lent]. (TA.) It is said in 
a trad., -^ 1 ' S 1 stall ^U^aa V [The 

redundance of water shall not be denied that the 
herbage be thereby denied]: (TA, in the present 
art.:) meaning that when there is a well in the 
desert, with herbage near it, and a person 
prevents others from drawing water, he thereby 
prevents the latter from availing themselves of 
the herbage; for when a man comes with his 
camels, and pastures them upon that herbage, 
and does not then water them, thirst kills them. 
(TA in art ^,) And it is said in another trad., J-taa 
jUll ^ jljVI [The redundant portion of the waist- 
wrapper is in the fire of Hell]; meaning what one 
drags [thereof] upon the around, by reason 
of pride. (TA;) And one says, (J-ijll J-t^a J*, 
meaning [In his hand is] the end of the 4 -* j [or 
nose-rein of the camel]. (TA.) ^jli and 

4 J with damm and with fet-h, [The thing 
having redundant portions] is the name of the 
coat of mail of the Prophet, which was thus 
called because having redundance and 
ampleness. (TA.) $ 1 *^ J a means The remains 
of the spoils when they are divided (TA;) such as 
a single horse, or a single camel (KL.) And by 
the J of women are meant The remains of the 
menstrual discharge (Ham p. 107: see, there, 
explanations of a verse in which this occurs.) (??) 
[The confederacy, or covenant, of the 3 j^, a 
word which is here of uncertain meaning,] is thus 
explained: Hashim and Zuhrah and Teym 
[accord, to the CK Teyma] went in to ’Abd-Allah 
Ibn-Jud’an, and united in a confederacy to repel 
wrongdoing, and to exact the due from the 
wrongdoer; and it was thus called because 
they bound themselves by their confederacy not 
to leave in the possession of any one aught 
remaining [of property] whereof he aught 
despond any one, without their taking it for him 
[i. e. the latter] from him [i. e. the former] (O, K, 
TA: [in the CK, til ■'- 4 ^ is a mistake for 
l^i:]) or it was thus called as being likened to a 
confederacy, or covenant, which was made of old,

called that of the u ijSS". (TA. [See art. m3.]) 

The saying j3 if 33a 3 jj V, and the like 
may be said of other sayings similar to it, means 
He does not possess a dirhem nor a deenar [or 
rather much less a deenar]: it is as though one 
said, he does not possess a dirhem: how then 
should he possess a deenar? for the negation of 
that which is much is a necessary consequence of 
the negation of that which is little: 33a is here in 
the accus case as an inf. n.; the implied meaning 
being <iIL> Aa J ■ '--fy l.aaa ‘ill* Aa [or 
rather 3) &c., i. e. he lacks the possession of a 
dirhem with a lacking exceeding the lacking of 
the possession of a deenar]: (Msb:) Kutb-ed- 
Deen Esh-Sheerazee says, (Msb, TA,) in 
the Expos, of the “ Miftah,” (TA,) 3iia is used in a 
case in which the inferior [of two things] is 
deemed a thing of which the existence 
is improbable, and the impossibility of the 
existence of a thing that is above it is meant 
thereby; wherefore it occurs between two 
phrases differing in meaning; and it is mostly 
used after a particle of negation: (Msb, TA:) AHei 
says that he had not found any authority for it in 
the [classical] language of the Arabs. (Msb. [See 
also which is used in a somewhat similar 
manner.]) 33a Wearing a single garment, such as 
is termed 3*3>; an epithet applied to a woman;

in the dial, of El-Yemen. (L in art. -r js.) — — 
And A woman proud, or self-conceited, or so in

the meaning]; contr. of (I'Ak, p. 143) [The 

pi. is 314 a] And The clothes that are used

called] because they are an addition over and 
above the clothes that are used on various [other] 

occasions. (TA.) And Wine; and so j 33=a 

[which see also in what here follows]: (O,

wine: (O:) or it signifies, accord, to AHn, the wine

c_a 

oldness; and ISd says that it is so called because 
the choice, or best, or most excellent, part thereof 
[for u* in my original (an obvious 

mistranscription) I read oi ] is what 

remains: (TA:) the pi. is 3>tiAa and 33=a

of 3J3a], (K.) <!3a i$ a n. of the same kind as 33. 
and 31 j: (AZ, S, O, TA:) one says, 33J 
33*11, meaning [Verily he is comely in respect of] 
the manner of wearing a single garment. (S, * O,

(Mgh, O, KT, TA,) nor a guardian (3 s4j), (KT, TA,) 
nor a proprietor, (TA,) nor a person of firm

pronunciation with fet-h to the ( -* is a mistake. 

(Mgh, O.) Also A tailor. (LAar, O, K.) 33a :

signifies The suffering, or receiving, the effect of 
an act, whether the effect is intended by the agent 
or not: or, accord, to some, particularly when 
the effect is not intended: for it is implied in a 
passage in the TA, that it is held by some to be 
used particularly in cases in which the effects are 
such as the blushing in consequence of 
confusion, or shame, affecting one from the 
seeing a person, and the emotion, or 
excitement, ensuing from the hearing of singing, 
and the agitation of the passionate lover at his 
seeing the object of his love : as a term of logic, it 
is one of the ten predicaments, i. e. passion, or 
suffering.] It is said that to every 3 there is 
an J3!, except to the act of creation, which 
proceeds from God; for this is the bringing into

says, the origination of anything, whether it 
be what is termed 3- [which means work or 
labour or service as well as a deed or an action] 
or other than it; so that it is more general 
in application than llo^: (TA:) or it is a 
metonymical term for any <3 [meaning deed or 


action] that is transitive (M, K, TA) or 
intransitive (M, TA:) or a mode that is accidental 
to the producer of an effect upon another [person 
or thing] by reason of the producing of the effect 
at the first; as the mode that ensues to the cutter 
by reason of his being cutting: or, as Er-Raghib 
says, the production of an effect considered with 
reference to an agent thereof; and it is common 
to that which is by his, or its, origination or 
otherwise, and to that which is with knowledge or 
otherwise, and to that which is by intention or 
otherwise, and to what proceeds from the human 
being or the animal [of any kind] or the 
inanimate thing; and 13 and 6“ are more 
particular in application: El-Harallee says that 
the 3 is what has become apparent in 
consequence of a motive of the efficient, whether 
from knowledge or otherwise, by reason of 
premeditation [for (an obvious 

mistranscription in my original) I read jj 3] or 
otherwise: and El-Juweynee says that it is what is 
within the limits of a small space of time, without 
repetition, or reiteration, whereas the 3- is what 
has been repeated, or reiterated, and whereof the 
time has been long; but this is repugned by the 
trad, [in which occurs the saying], 3 '- i 

[expl. in art. j*j]; (TA:) the pi. is 13 (S, O, Msb, 
K) and 3-*^' [a pi. of pauc.], (O, TA,) [and 1)3^ is 
app. a pi. pi., i. e. pi. of 131, like 63' pi. of 63'

original without any vowel-signs, perhaps 
because well known: and it is there added 
that may be pi. of J 3' (which has been 

altered by the copyist and is probably a 
mistranscription for <430 or of J3I; with other 
remarks equally doubtful and unimportant.]) 
[Hence, 3“% meaning Actually; as opposed 

to s jail; i. e. potentially, or virtually.] As used 

by the grammarians, it means [A verb; i. e.] what 
denotes a meaning in itself together with any one 
of the three times [past and present and future: 
but it should be observed that it includes 
the or infinitive noun; and also that there 
is what is termed 32- 3 an incomplete, i. e. 
non-attributive, verb (as 3 coordinate to 3- =, 
&c.); as well as what is termed 3 3 a complete, 
i. e. attributive, verb]. (TA.) <1*2 A single 3 [i.

Thus in the saying in the Kur [xxvi. 18], 3*i3

one deed that thou hast done]; as though the 


speaker said, 3113 3^ cJ3 : in which Esh- 
Shaabee read { 3!»i [thy kind of deed], with 
kesr, as meaning 33 4 3 <3' 13s : so says Zj; 
but he adds that the former reading is better. 
(TA.) And [hence also] one says, 3^ ilia 3 dulS

preceding paragraph. 3a A custom,

liberality, or bounty, (O,) and generosity, (O, K, 
[the only meaning assigned to it in the S,]) and 
the like of these: (O:) or, (O, K,) accord, to IAar, 
(O,) the doing of a single person, peculiarly, [as 
distinguished from 13, q. v.,] (O,) relating to 
good and to evil; (O, K;) one says, J31' ^3 l 3 
[Such a one is generous in respect of doing or 
doings], and J31I 3 jMa [Such a one is mean in 
respect of doing or doings]; (O: [and the like is 
said in the T and in the Msb;]) and Az says that 
this is the correct explanation: not that of Lth; 
and Mbr [likewise] says, it is used in 
commendation and in discommendation: (O:) 

and it is used only of a single agent. (O, K.) 

It is also an inf. n. (S, O, Msb. [See 1, first 
sentence.]) 113, as distinguished from 13, 
signifies A doing that is between two [agents]; 
(IAar, O, K, TA;) and therefore it is an inf. n. of 
l 63 [a verb of which I have not found any ex.]. 

(TA.) It is also a pi. of 113 (S, O, Msb, K. —

Az, however, mentions it as signifying full 
[like 4 *- 2 ], applied to a river, or rivulet: and Aboo- 
Sahl cites an ex. of it from the verses of the Fs as 

signifying full of flesh. (TA.) The phrase 34 “ 

4 * 2 * may be of the same category as 4“*>4 4* 
[for £], the meaning being A torrent 

having the quality of filling; though the 
possessive epithet in most instances has the form 
of the act. part, n., such as [for Cili] 
and 4 * 2 = 3 * [for “j' j]: or it may be that 4*2* in 

this case is expressive of muchness, or

meanings of poetry clear and perspicuous, and 
unveiled them, and shunned substitution and 
obscure diction: jp with what is [to be

to be without want; (Esh-Shafi'ee, T, O, K;) so 
that the former is in a harder condition than the 
latter accord, to Esh-Shafi'ee; (T;) and it seems 
that he is called j3a because of crippleness, or 
protracted disease, which prevents his 
freely employing himself in making gain: (Khalid 
Ibn-Yezeed:) As also says that the latter is in a 
better condition than the former; (S, O, K;) and 
so says Ahmad Ihn-'Obeyd: (TA:) and as to the 
verse of Er-Ra'ee, cited above, it is said to mean 
that the person there mentioned had a 
milch camel in former times, but possessed it no 
longer, and that 3L 3 *4 means that nothing 
was left to him: (Mgh:) the pi. of the latter epithet 
is also applied in the Kur xviii. 78 to men 
possessing a ship, or boat, which is worth a 
considerable sum; (Mgh;) whence Aboo- 
Bekr holds the opinion of As to he correct: (TA:) 
but it is urged in reply, that these men were 
hirers, not owners, of the vessel, as appears 
from one reading, [app. for uj 33,] with 

teshdeed: (TA:) or the former signifies one who 
has neither property nor gain that suffices for his 
need; and the latter, one who has property or 
gain not sufficient for him: or, as some say, the 
converse is the truth: (Bd in ix. 60:) or both 
signify the same, (IAar, S, K,) one who possesses 
nothing: (IAar, S:) or when they are used 
together, they differ in signification; and when 
used separately, they both [sometimes] signify 
the same: (El-Bedr El-Karafee:) [see more

the next day arrived, the sacred month 
commenced, and the opportunity escaped him: 
(M, TA:) or an hour observed by the Arabs in the 
Time of Ignorance; namely, the last hour of the

deficient, and by [the addition of] which it 
becomes complete; for sometimes some persons 
see the new moon when others do not see it, and 
these latter make a hostile attack, or incursion,

the O and TA: but it may be that Oi and 0-4 are 
mistranscriptions for 4*1 and 0-4; and therefore 
that for 41a (which is not mentioned as a pi. of 41a 
in the K) we should read 4li.]) And 41a 
signifies The pole of heaven; [generally the north 


c_a 

celestial pole;] likened to the pivot, or axis, of the

the joints: (O, K:) and loose in the bones; (K;) or 
weak, loose in the bones, and flaccid; thus expl. 
by Ibn-’Abbad: (O:) and having a pain in his 
patella (4S j 4la (O, K.) 4ii : i. q. 4li, q. v . —

(K;) [and] is thus called because of its roundness: 
(S, O:) [it is a piece of wood, generally of 
a hemispherical form, or nearly so, through the 
middle of which the upper part of the spindle-pin

of the measure of two spears or a spear and a

places. — — Also Anything circular, (K.) — — 
And [particularly] The joint [or

either of these meanings in the verse cited above.

signifying The location that is above, or over;] 
and is an adv. n. (Mgh, Msb, K) of place; (Mgh, 
Msb;) and a simple noun, indecl., [with dammeh 
for its termination, when the noun to which it 
should be prefixed is suppressed, and the 
meaning of this is intended to be understood, but 
not the word itself;] but when it is prefixed to 
another noun [which is either expressed or itself 
(and not merely its meaning) meant to be 
understood, and when the noun to which it 
should be prefixed is suppressed and neither this 
nor its meaning is meant to be understood,] it is 
declinable. (K. [For the words

MS. copy of the K (which I follow in this case)

[Zeyd is above, or rather upon, the house-top].

thou, or wilt thou, sleep in the part that is above 
of the house &c., or in the part that is below? i. e., 
in the upper part, or in the lower part?] with fet- 
h, as suppressing the noun to which 33 is [meant 
to be understood as] prefixed. (TA.) Lth says that 
he who uses it as a [by which (like other old 
writers) he means an adv. n. of place] should use 
the accus. case, as when one says, ja j 33 3' 4° 
[’Abd- Allah is above Zeyd]: but if you make it 
simply a noun, you use the nom. case, and 
say, 33 j [His superior (meaning upper) part 

is his head]; for in this instance it is the head 
itself, and you make each to be governed in the 
nom. case by the other. (TA.) In the saying in the 
Kur [xvi. 28 ], f*!3 3“ ‘-3311 £$jlc. jka [And the 
roof fell on them from above them], the utility of 
the phrase f33 3 is hardly apparent, 

because sometimes serves in its stead: but IJ 
says that ^33 3 may here have a useful office; 
for 33 is sometimes used in relation to deeds [or 
events] that are difficult, and deemed onerous; 
[for instance,] you say, 33 3° '-33)3 ' 3 ^ ^3“ 3 
[We have journeyed ten nights and the journeys 
two nights have remained as though incumbent 
on us]; &c.; so that if it were said ‘-““II jki 


without the adding p -33 it might be 

supposed to be like the saying '-33 k 3 3 j'i> 33° 
[Their abode had become in a state of ruin as a 
punishment upon them]; but when He [referring 
to God] says f33 3, that meaning which was 
supposable ceases to be so; and the meaning 
becomes this, that it [the roof] fell when they 
were beneath it. (TA.) 33 33 f^3 3 3 j 33 4 
[when they came to you from above you and 
from below you], in the Kur [xxxiii. 10 ], relates 
to Benoo- Kureydhah, who came to them from 
above them; and to Kureysh and Ghatafan, who 
came from the district of Mekkeh, from below 
them. (TA.) 3-Ap )>jj f«^3 ' 3“' 34' j, in the Kur [ii. 
208 ], means (assumed tropical:) [But those who 
have been careful of their religious duties] shall 
be above them in station [on the day of

what has been stated in the first sentence of this 
paragraph, 33 3 “331, and 33 3 “43i, [meaning

latter being meant the fly [mentioned in the Kur 
xxii. 72 ] and the spider [mentioned in xxix. 40 ], 
(Fr, S, O,) and the phrase as expl. in the former 
sense being like the reply to him who says “ Such

also expl. as signifying wheat; (T, S, M, Msb, K;)

the meaning is f 4, i. e. “ wheat; ” (T;) accord, to 
Fr, it is an old word, signifying thus, (T, S, *) and 
also bread; (T, S, K;) Zj says that there is no 


difference of state- ment among the lexicologists 
as to its having the former of these two meanings, 
that it is said to have the latter also, and that it 
also signifies the other grains, beside wheat, 
whereof bread is made [which last meaning is 
also mentioned in the K]; (T;) and IJ holds that it 
is rightly expl. as having the first of these three 
meanings (i. e. “ wheat ”) and the last of them: 
(M:) another meaning assigned to it is o*»**. [i. e. 
cicer arietinum; or chick-peas]; (S, K;) which is of

its case is plain; as pi. of 44 it is like j'J as pi.

which an ex. occurs in a verse cited in the first

some copies of the S,] with the j quiescent, on 
the authority of IJ; (TA;) the » is elided, and the j

changed into ', because of the fet-hah preceding 
it, so the word becomes la; but a noun may not be 
of two letters whereof one is [the j of] the 


tenween, (K, TA,) thus the passage is expressed 
in the M, but MF remarks that correctly we 
should say whereof one is the I, (TA,) and 
therefore a hard letter is substituted for it, one 
similar to it in kind, which is for they are 
both labials, and in the is a sort of humming 
sound [Is A, in the CK is A,) in the mouth, [or 
rather in the nose,] resembling [the sound of] 
the prolongation of the j: (K, TA:) [several 
similar disquisitions, added in the TA, respecting 
the change from ‘A to 4, I omit, regarding them 
as needless: what is said on this subject in the S, 
in art. A, I have mentioned in that art.:] in the

mistake: (IB, TA:) the dual of fa is and

[and respecting which see the first paragraph of 
art. fi,] Sb says that it is used by poetic 
license. (TA.) In using it as a prefixed noun, in 
the phrase A, ja they deemed the combination 

of the two »s difficult in respect of 
utterance; therefore they suppressed the 
[radical] » thereof [in this case, and then in other, 
similar, cases], and said, » A and 47 4, 

and 4j la 4)j, and 4j Af and when 

prefixing it to [the pronoun denoting] thyself, 
thou sayest, A and this thou dost alike 
in using it in the nom. case and in the accus. and 
in the gen., because the j [of 4] is changed into lS 
and is then incorporated [into 
the pronominal ls]: (S, and the like is said in the 
Msb:) and sometimes, though rarely, they did the 
like in other cases, when not prefixing it; for 
instance, li occurs at the end of a verse of El- 
'Ajjaj, without an affix, in this case for l»la. (S.) — 
— In the saying A J! meaning I spoke to 

him, his mouth being near to my mouth, »li is 
in the accus. case as a denotative of state: (S, TA: 
*) or by reason of the derivative [UJSA] meant to 
be understood: or, as Sb says, it is an instance of 
one of the nouns that are put in the place of inf. 
ns., and it is not to be separated from what 
should follow it, so that you may not say »la AAZ 
[alone], for you tell of your nearness to the 
person, and that there is not any one between 
you and him: and if you will, you may use the 
nom. case, meaning 4U. [this being his 
state], (Sb, TA,) i. e. A <4! “4 [his mouth was 
near to my mouth], the clause [following <4S] 
occupying the place of a denotative of state. (TA.) 

The saying 44 litf, (Meyd, K, TA,) which is 

a prov., (Meyd, TA,) means May God make the 


mouth of misfortune to cleave to thy 
mouth; (Meyd, K, * TA;) [but lit. signifies, only, 
her, or its, mouth to thy mouth; and is [likewise] 
an instance of one of the nouns that are used in 
the manner of inf. ns. expressive of imprecation, 
by reason of a verb not mentioned: Sb says, kali is 
without tenween, meaning 4 a 4I la, as is shown 
by the saying, la V (jiill A u 4*11 aA

the ground to be in thy mouth; that it is like the 
sayings j44l 44 and 4£VI 44; (S, Meyd;) and 
[hence] it means disappointment [cleave] to thee: 
(S, * Meyd:) a man of Belhujeym, (S, Meyd,) cited 
by A'Obeyd, (S,) addressing a wolf that sought to 
get his she-camel, (Meyd,) says, 44 l* la 4 cJaa

Meyd; but in the S, as IB has observed, 4ls 
is erroneously put for 4-4;) i. e. [who will 
entertain thee with] the shooting of arrows; 
(Meyd;) [by 4ylf] he means 4:44 from AA 
(S:) it is also said that lila is 
metonymically used as meaning the dust of the 
earth, which is termed the mouth of the earth 
because it drinks the water; and it is as though 
the saying meant the dust be in thy mouth: 
(Meyd:) Sh is related to have said, I heard IAar 
say lila j, 44, with tenween, meaning may God 
make thy mouth to cleave to the ground; [or 
rather, ground to thy mouth; lit., simply, a mouth 
to thy mouth;] and some say 44 1*4 without 
tenween, as an imprecation meaning (assumed 
tropical:) may God break thy A [i- e - thy teeth, to 
which A is often metonymically applied, as is 

also »4]. (TA.) One says also, jili A^ 

4^4 A 4 meaning (tropical:) Such a one drew 
for his camels the water when they came to it, 
while they were drinking; not having stored it for 
them in the drinking-trough: and <kj jMi jk 
444 A^ (tropical:) Such a one suffered his 
camels to pasture while going along [by his 
driving them gently: see art. j4): so says As: 
and so accord, to the A and other lexicons; but 
the author of the K, by an omission, has assigned 
the latter explanation to the former phrase. (TA.)

applied to him who has stinking breath. (TA. [An

Six Ancient Arabic Poets,” p. 125 ; and differently 
in De Slane's “ Diwan d'Amro-'kais,” p. 36 of the 

Arabic text.]) And VjL j 3 [Mouth of a large 

fieldrat] and '-3 j 3 [Mouth of a sort of small

also, » ja V, meaning (tropical:) May his teeth,

ambiguous (though correct), has misled Freytag 
in this case.]) And [in like manner, using J in the

with which a perfume, or an odoriferous 
substance, is compounded or prepared (jk*i); 
like as JjIjj signifies things, or substances, with

(2^*5) ar e also called ^*4=^ (Msb:) [the pi.

the only reading that I find in other copies of the

he says that ^ jsVI signifies what are prepared

sometimes they are of herbs, or leguminous 
plants: (TA:) and also sorts, or species, of a thing 
[app. of any kind]: (K:) and one says, i> 3*

road; (S, Msb, K, TA;) signifying the A [or 
mouth]; as also J, (K, TA,) without teshdeed; 
mentioned by IAar: (TA:) or it signifies thus in 
relation to a river, or rivulet; (Lth, Msb, TA;) 
the foremost part thereof: or, as some say, the 
place of its pouring into the 4*Ui£ [q. v .]: and 
accord, to Lth, in relation to a valley, or water- 
course, or torrent-bed, its o“j [or head, as 
though in this case having one, or each, of two 
contr. meanings, unless, as I believe it to be, the 
mouth, or outlet, of a valley or water-course or

its foremost part]: (TA:) and of a street, it is the 
place of egress, or exit; (Msb;) the foremost 
part thereof: (TA:) and of a road, it is the A [or 
mouth], which is the upper part thereof fy^l): 
(Msb: [thus in my copy; but I think that is a 
mistranscription, in my copy, for 4131, and that 
the correct meaning is therefore the foremost

relation to a road and to a river or rivulet:]) 
but accord, to some, J. 4* A, without teshdeed, is 
not allowable; and one should say, J4. 4*3 jjjIJI

a mistranscription for A, with the j quiescent, 
both meaning He sat at the mouth of the road]; 
not J. -A, without teshdeed: (TA:) 

and 443a signifies also (assumed tropical:) the 
first, or foremost, part, of a thing; (K, TA;) like 


that of the street and that of the river or rivulet: 
[whence] one says, 41LI 4* 3a 1414 jHa i. e. 
(tropical:) The first, or foremost, portion of thy 
camels [came to us, or came forth upon us]; like 
the phrase 4* 3a; (TA:) the pi. of 4* 3a 

is (Ks, S, Msb, TA,) which is anomalous, (S, 
Msb, TA,) and (TA) cliU3a [in the CK cjl*3a] 
and 4 jl 3 a. (K, TA.) [Hence] one says, A A J* 1 
aLLj! ^ I jL 441, (A, K, * TA,) in the copies of

also A say, or saying, or speech; (S, K, TA;) from 1 
in the first of the senses assigned to it above: 
hence one says, 4*341 u] (S, TA) Verify the 
retracting of that which has been said is difficult: 
(Har p. 434 :) and [hence] one says also, >

(TA.) — — And The Muslims' rending one

backbiting; (K, TA;) as also | 4* A- (TA.) 43] 

4*3® means Verily he is strong in speech, and 

free, or unconstrained, in tongue. (TA.) And 

one says, Sill li* j 4 * 33 441 U ; meaning 

[How vehement is] thy camel's eating [of this 
herbage]! and in like manner, 4Ljja 4 * 33 
[the vehement eating of thy horse]: whence their

(S, TA.) [See also in art. 33.] and 

l (S, K,) the latter originally »jp, (S,) 
Eloquent; (S, K, TA;) and so A3 applied to a 
woman; (S, TA;) able in speech; an able speaker: 
or A signifies good in speech; a good speaker: 
(TA:) or both signify good and eloquent in 
speech; as though taken from »jill meaning “ 
width of the mouth: ” (LAar, TA:) or having an 
inordinate desire, or appetite, for food; a 
vehement eater; (K, TA;) applied to a man and to 
other than man: (TA:) and the latter (Aa), having 
an inordinate and insatiable desire, or appetite, 
for food: (TA:) and this also signifies a man who 
eats much; syn. 3 A; (S, K;) and so does J, 

(K [in some copies of which, A A is strangely put 
in the place of JjSI in the explanation here 
given]:) or J. signifies a man eating 

vehemently after scantiness, (S,) or after 
weakness: (thus in a copy of the S:) and is 
also expl. as meaning a man who eats 
vehemently. (TA.) And one says (K, TA) 

meaning [Very] eloquent in speech: (TA:) 
and 3-33 (K, TA) Good, or excel-lent, speech, 
or diction. (TA.) — means [Beverage, 

or wine,] perfumed (K, TA.) with [the 
odoriferous substances called] Ajlai [pi. pi. of » A 
q. v.]. (TA.) — And m 3 (Lth, K) and <_sjA (K) 
A garment, or piece of cloth, dyed with »3 [or »3, 
i. e. madder]. (Lth, K.) see the next 

preceding paragraph, in two places, 3 is a 
particle governing the gen. case [and used in the 
manners and senses expl in what here follows]. 
(T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) — — It relates to a 
receptacle; (Sb, S, M;) and, when used in a wider 
sense, to that which has some near 
resemblance thereto; (Sb, M;) [i. e.,] and also to 
what is considered as a receptacle: (S:) [in other 
words,] it denotes inclusion, or inbeing, (Msb, 
Mughnee, K, TA,) either in relation to place or in 
relation to time: (Mughnee, K, TA;) properly and 
tropically. (Msb, Mughnee, TA.) A-' A f jji 1 

[The 

Greeks have been overcome in the nearer, or 
nearest, part of the land, and they, after the 
overcoming of them, shall overcome in some few 
years], in the Kur [xxx. l — 3], is an ex. of its 
relation to place and to time. (Mughnee.) 
And » A- A Aj (tropical:) [And there is, 

to you, in retaliation, life, or an advantage, 
(respecting the meaning of which see art. ^ , ) in 
the Kur ii. 175,] is an ex. of its being 
used tropically, (Mughnee.) A ‘L *liJ 

is an ex. of its relation to place, but the 
proposition is inverted [i. e. the meaning is 
I inserted my finger into the signet-ring]. 


c_a 

(Mughnee.) [Using it properly,] you say, A All 
A3 [The water is in the vessel]: (S:) and A > 
m'jA [It is in the wallet,] and A [in the 
purse]: and A uA A 3* [He is in the belly of his 
mother]: and 3»JI A A [He is in the shackle for 
the neck]: (M:) and j3l A Sjj [Zeyd is in 
the house], (S, M, * Msb,) or within the house, 
and in the midst of it, for jAl A, means AA 1 -, 
and (T:) and [using it tropically, 

you say,] jAl A ““ill (assumed tropical:) 
[Doubt, or uncertainty, is in the information]. 
(S.) The saying m 3- A [In him is a fault, 
or blemish], if relating to a real mA, is proper; 
and if relating to an ideal m 3, tropical: the 
former is such as the amputation of the hand 
of the thief, and the redundance of a hand; and 
the latter, such as the runningaway of a slave. 
(Msb.) [When relating to time, it may in 
some cases be rendered In, or during; as in the 
phrase A- A, in the Kur ii. 139, i. e. In, or 
during, certain numbered days. AjJI A-LAI u! 
jA-Sti JLi A fjJl , in the Kur xxxvi. 55, may be 
rendered (assumed tropical:) Verily the inmates 
of Paradise this day shall be in the midst of 
diverting occupation, cheerful, or happy. The 
phrased U liS Ul ; fit. (assumed tropical:) 
As to his saying thus, in it is what is in it, is used 
as a polite expression of objection, 

or contradiction; like A, q. v . In many 
instances, A may be rendered Of, or concerning, 
or in respect of; as in A aA Jla 
(assumed tropical:) He said of, or concerning, 
him, or it, thus; for A A Jla (assumed 
tropical:) He said in mentioning him, or it, thus, 
or A in describing him, or it; or the like 
hence, for ex., one says Alii p? A A4 AS 
(assumed tropical:) He wrote a book of, 
or concerning the science of lexicology: and 
hence, in the Kur ii. 133, Al A A jSAjI (assumed 
tropical:) Do ye argue with us concerning, or in 
respect of, God?] — — It also denotes 
concomitance, (Mughnee, K,) and (K) in this ease 
(Mughnee) it is syn. with A- (Msb, Mughnee, K.) 
Thus in the phrase, A 1 A3 Jla [He shall say, 
Enter ye with peoples]. (Msb, Mughnee, TA,) in 
the Kur [vii. 36]: (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, the 
meaning is, g-3 AlA A [in the company of 
peoples]. (Mughnee.) Thus, too, in the phrase, in 
the Kur [xlvi. 15], All mAAI A [with the 
inmates of Paradise]. (Msb, TA.) [Or in these 
and similar instances, A may be rendered, more 
agreeably with the primary signification, as 
meaning Among.] In the K, the meaning as 
denoting concomitance and that which is 
identical with A are made distinct: and it has 


been said that m denotes the continuance of 
concomitance and A denotes its commencement; 
though this is not invariably the case. (MF, TA.) 
[Hence it is used to denote a combination of two 
qualities: as in the phrase fAjlLI A 3 A 
(assumed tropical:) Length together 

with laxness: (occurring in the K voce mA) 
and jlA A - 31 JA (assumed tropical:) Blackness 
blending with redness: and the like. And in 
like manner it is used to denote the combination 
of the length and breadth of a thing: as in the 
phrase hA A Alji uj 3 A Its 

length is twenty cubits with (or as we say by) 
three cubits in breadth: in which case the number 
of square cubits is expressed by the 
phrase A'-’ A ujjA as though meaning Twenty 
as a multiplicand with three as its multiplier; i. e. 
twenty multiplied by three: see A A 3 as 

signifying “ he multiplied. ”]. It also denotes 

the assigning of a cause. (Msb, Mughnee, K.) 
Thus in the phrase ,jj*jjl A i- e. On account, 
or because, of completing [the possession of] 
forty sheep or goats, [the giving of] a sheep or 
goat [for the poor-rate] is incumbent [on 
the possessor: or this may be rendered, in the 
case of the possession of forty, a sheep or goat is 
to be given]. (Msb.) And thus in the saying, [in 
the Kur xii. 32,] A AA <_A [And that is he 
because of whom ye blamed me]. (Mughnee.) 
Thus also in the saying, in a trad., All si A jl 
ALA s js, A jull [Verily a woman entered the fire 
of Hell because of a she-cat which she confined 
without food]. (Mughnee.) [And thus in the 
phrase A A All He paid in advance, or 
beforehand, for, or on account of, such a thing.] 

It also denotes superiority; (Mughnee, K, 

TA;) i. e. (TA) it is used in the sense of A- (T, S, 
M, Msb, TA.) Thus in the saying, in the Kur [xx. 
74], jAll £ jii. A pin Y^ ij [And I will assuredly 
crucify you upon the trunks of palm-trees]. (T, S, 
Msb, Mughnee, TA.) And so in the verse of 
'Antarah cited voce £A. (T, M, Mughnee, TA.) 
And Yoo asserts that the Arabs say, A3 A 'Ll! jj, 
meaning Ac. [1. e. I alighted, or descended and 

stopped, &c., at the abode of thy father]. (S.) 

It is also syn. with m, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) 
sometimes. (S.) Thus in the saying of Zeyd-el- 
Kheyl, jA A uj AjA 33 fji Ajjj 
A^j jAYI (S, Mughnee, TA,) meaning, 

A^ 1 j j»LVI [i. e . And horsemen skilful in piercing 
the aortas and the kidneys ride in the day of fear 
therein]. (S, TA.) And thus in a verse cited by 
Fr, ji is made trans. by A and A instead of m 
and CP. (T, TA.) [Thus, also, fA“ is 

sometimes used for fA3 JA, meaning It is

[BOOKI.] 


s_a 


nought; or not of any account or weight; &c.: 

see more in art. 4“.] It is also syn. with JJ. 

(Mughnee, K.) Thus in the Kur [xiv. to], I 

[And they put their hands to their 
mouths]. (Mughnee, TA.) — — It is also syn. 
with Of- (M, Mughnee, K, TA.) Thus in the Kur 
[xxvii. 12 ], pL) £-42 ^ [Of, or among, nine signs]. 
(M, TA.) And in the saying, JAM Ij4c. J ii. 

[Take thou for me ten of the camels; of, or 
among, them let there be two stallions. (M, TA.) 
[Thus too in the saying <f ja J4=i ^ > He is of, 
or among, the purest in race, &c., of his people: 
and the like thereof.] — — It also denotes 
comparison; and this is when it occurs between 
a preceding [mention of a] thing excelled and a 
following [mention of a] thing excelling: as in the 
saying, [in the Kur ix. 38 ,] ^ Uiil Ua 

i]a VI SJ4-VI [But the enjoyment of the present 
life, in comparison with that which is to come, is 

no other than little]. (Mughnee, K.) It is 

also used for compensation; and this is when it is 
redundant as a compensation for another [<_s 4 ] 
which is suppressed: as in the saying, 

*44 j for <0 ^ 4 ? J O i *4 >4= [I beat, or struck, him 
whom thou desiredst]: (Mughnee, K:) but this 
is allowed by Ibn-Malik alone. (Mughnee.)— — 
And it is used for corroboration: (Mughnee, K:) 
this is when it is redundant without its being for 
compensation: and this El-Farisee allows in a 
case of necessity in verse; citing as an ex., I 4 
JLL! Jill lit *4* [I am Aboo- 
Saad; when the night becomes dark, 
thou imagining its blackness to be black leather]. 
(Mughnee.) And it is thus used in the saying, in 
the Kur [xi. 43 ], L$ja 1 J4} [for 4 , jjSJI, i. e. 

And he said, Embark ye therein, the like of which 
occurs also in xviii. 70 and xxix. 65 ], (Mughnee, 
K,) accord, to some. (Mughnee.) - J as a 
prefixed noun in the gen. case, syn. with 
and as syn. with cs-4, see voce » js, in art. »ji. 
is a word expressive of wonder: they say, Li Ji U 
liS J»ii J [o my wonder! What has happened to 
me that I do thus?]: or it is expressive of regret 
on account of a thing that is passing away [so that 
this exclamation may be rendered Oh! What has 
happened to me &c.]: Ks says that it is not to be 
written withe [though it is so written in several of 
the lexicons in art. 4®, i. e. fja]; and that it 
means U [as first expl. above]: and in 

like manner one says, “LljL^Lsii Li Ja 11 [o my 
wonder! What are thy companions? i. e. what 
manner of men are thy companions? 4 here 
denoting interrogation respecting qualities, or 
attributes; as in the Kur xxvi. 22 ]: and he says 
that 4 in this case occupies the place of a noun 
in the nom. case. (M, TA.) Ks is also related to 


have said that some of the Arabs express wonder 
by Js and J* and *J-4 and some add 4, 
saying 4*a 11 and 44 4 and 442; 4, meaning How 
good, or beautiful, is this! the K is faulty here; 
mentioning only Lila 4 , and explaining it 
as denoting wonder. (TA.) 44 : see 34ii ; in 
art. 4a. 4a 1 44, aor. *J4, inf. n. *Js (S, O, Msb) 
and *j4, (O,) He (a man, Msb) returned; (S, O,

also [ 311a and j 34a, [or the former of these, 
accord, to analogy, is an inf. n. of unity, and the 
latter an inf. n. of modality,] and “*4I 
and s*4iJ al' signify (K:) or, accord, to 

some, *4 signifies particularly he returned to a 
good state or condition. (MF, TA.) One says, *4 
a* He returned [to a good state, or 
recovered, from his anger]: (M, TA:) and ui4 
^ * Jill [Such a one is quick in respect 
of the returning &c. from his anger]: (S, M, * O:) 
and 1 34all £0*4 4l, (M,) or [ 31iill (S, O,) i. e.

O:) and J, -4411 jo** *y*4aill £o*“ > [He is quick in 
respect of anger, quick in respect of returning, 
or recovering, therefrom]. (A, TA.) And cJJ *4 
jiVI, and »*4 [i. e. J*VI *4], inf. n. *Ji and *44, He 
returned [to the affair, or to the command, i. e. to 
that which was commanded]. (M, TA.) *243 LS ^- 
311 lJ] , in the Kur xlix. 9 , means Until it 
[referring to a party (5jjU=.) before mentioned] 
return to the ordinance of God, or to that which 
God has commanded: (Bd:) or until it return (T, 
Msb) to obedience, (T,) or to that which is right. 
(Msb.) And j3VI cJJ *4, inf. n. *Ja, signifies also 

He reconsidered the affair, or case. (TA.) *4 

Jyill (M, Msb, K) ■'ll jil Of, (M, K,) inf. n. *Ja, 
(TA,) or l 331a, (Msb,) means The man who had 
sworn to abstain from conjugal intercourse with 
his wife expiated his oath and returned to her. 
(M, Msb, * K. [See Kur ii. 226 .]) But MF observes 
that this usage of *4 to signify He expiated an 
oath belongs to the conventional language of the 
law. (TA.) In the case of a man who has sworn 
that he will abstain from conjugal intercourse 
with his wife, a period of four months is 
appointed to him in the Kur-an; and if he have 
such intercourse with her in the four months, it is 
said of him, *4 ia, meaning He has returned [or 
reverted] from his oath, to the doing that which 
he swore that he would not do, and is bound to

without transposition: that it is not of the 
measure 314 from 1(4; for, if it were, it would 
be of the same measure as 344 [i. e. it would 
be <43]; therefore, if not formed by transposition, 
it would be of the measure 314 [i. e. it would be 
from b3, as some hold it to be], because of 
the [or alteration for the sake of alleviating 
the sound, such as takes place in for 
which cannot be in a noun of the measure 314 
from a triliteral root like 4, whose medial radical 
is infirm], the last radical being hemzeh: but its 
formation by transposition 

from 34 [originally 3i4] to 34, which is then 
changed to 3313, as Z says in the “ Falk,” is what 
determines the cii to be augmentative, and
