PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

[BOOK I.] 

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 




The twenty-first letter of the alphabet: called 43. 
Respecting its pronunciation as the title of the 
fiftieth chapter of the Kur-an, see in 

art. - It is one of the letters termed [or 

vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not 
with the breath only]; its place of utterance is 
between the root of the tongue and the uvula, in 
the furthest part of the mouth; and it is of the 
strongest of the letters, and of the most certain of 
them in sound. (TA at the commencement 
of ‘ — still <_jL.) it is sometimes pronounced like the 
Pers. 4 i. e. 44 4 jj4l Jill; in which case it 
is termed »3j*idl ■ — alill [?]: this mode of 
pronouncing it is well known as of the dial, of the 
people of El-Yemen [and others]: Ibn-Khaldoon 
says that it is of the dial, of Mudar; and that some 
of the people of the [Prophet's] house are 
so extravagant as to assert that recitation in 
prayer is not rightly but with this letter thus 
pronounced. (MF and TA voce l-'-dA . ) it has 
been substituted for one letter, i. e. 4 [as some 
say,] in the instance of 4411 4£l [for which they 
sometimes said 431], (MF and TA at 
the commencement of <— m4. [It is there added 
that a pi. of 4$i has been heard, but not of 4Si ; 
and this is a sign of the originality of the former: 
but -431 is mentioned as pi. of 431 in art. u5l in 
the TA.]) m 3 l fUill m" 3 , (As, S, O, K,) aor. A ia, inf. 

n. 44, (K,) He ate the food. (As, S, O, K.) 

And eiill 4 3 He drank the water; as also <1)5: (K:) 
or he drank all the water that was in the vessel. 

(As, S, O, K.) And m 1 !^ 1 i> m 3 , aor. A3 , inf. 

n. 4 3 and m" 3 , (K, TA,) the latter thus (4ij4), 
agreeably with analogy, (TA, [but in the CK m 3 ,])

also 4 4 3 : (Lth:) or he drank the beverage: 
(TA:) and, or simply 44 like Mi 1 *- 31 , (S,) he drank 
much water. (S, TA.) 4 jj4: see <yi». 414 and 
i 44 A vessel that takes, or receives, much 
water: (O, K:) the latter epithet expl. by Lth as 
signifying taking, or receiving, much. (L.) 44: 
see what next precedes. 44 (S, O, K) and i 4 j 4 
(K) One who drinks much water: (S, O:) or one 
who drinks much. (K.) 4 i 44 aor. 3—4 (M, 
K,) inf. n. 44, (M,) or 4 4, (so in the K, [but see 
the next sentence,]) and 4, (TA,) said of a 
number of men (4), They raised a clamour, 


or confusion of cries or shouts or noises, in 
contention, or litigation, (M, K,) or in dispute. 
(M.) And 4, aor. 634 , inf. n. 44 (S, M, O, 
K,) and m 4 (M, K,) said of a lion, (S, M, O, K,) 
and of a stallion [camel], (M, K,) He made the 
gnashing (44 [inf. n. of 1 44], S, O, or 443, M, 
K) of his canine teeth to be heard: (S, M, O, K:) 
and in like manner the verb (M, K) with the same 
inf. ns. (M) is said of the canine tooth of the 
stallion [camel] and of the lion, (M, K,) meaning 
it made a sounding, and a gnashing: (K:) and 
some expl. 44 in a general manner, saying that it 
signifies a sounding, or sound: (M:) 44 also, 
and 44, [both inf. ns. of 1 44,] (M,) or the 
former and 44, (TA,) signify the sounding [or 
gnashing] of the canine teeth of the 
stallion [camel]: and his braying: or, as some say, 
the reiterating of the braying: (M, TA:) and 1 44 
and 44 signify the sounding of the chest or belly 
of the horse. (S, M, O.) — And 4, aor. 634 , inf. 
n. 4 4, said of flesh-meat, It lost its moisture, (S, 
M, O, K,) or fresh-ness: (M, K:) and in like 
manner said of dates (4), (S, M, O, Msb, [in 
my copy of the last of which the inf. n. is said to 
be m4,]) and of the skin, and of a wound: (S, O:) 
and hence said of the back of a man who had 
been beaten with the whip or some other thing, 
meaning the marks of the beating thereof became 
in a healing state, and dried. (As, O, TA.) And 43 
444, (M, TA,) thus correctly, but in copies of the 
K 1 4)5, (TA,) [and the CK has 444 for 4 4jll,] is 
said to signify The fresh ripe date became 
somewhat dry after the ripening: (M, TA:) or 

became dry. (K.) And 4^ 4, aor. 034 

and 634 , [the latter anomalous,] inf. n. 4, The

MA, O, * K, *) lank in the belly: (S, * M, O, * K: *) 
and 44, uncontracted, as in some other 
instances, said of a woman [as meaning she was, 
or became, slender in the waist, lank in the belly], 
is mentioned by IAar: (M:) and some say, of 
the belly of the horse, 4, (M, TA,) meaning his 
flanks became lank; (M;) or his flanks adhered to 
his 44 [dual, of 44 q. v.]: (TA:) or one says, 
[app. of a horse,] 44 4, (k, TA,) inf. n. 4a; (TA;) 


and 44, (K, TA,) inf. n. 44, in the original 
uncontracted forms, anomalously, (TA,) meaning 
his belly became lank. (K, TA.) And one says 
also, 44 4, i. e. His (a horse's) belly was, or 
became, firmly compacted, so as to have a round 
form: and 4a means He caused it to be so: (O, 
TA:) the aor. of the latter is 34. and the inf. n. 
is 4. (TA.) — 4 He collected, or gathered 

together, the extremities of the thing; as also 
1 4. (m, TA.) — And 4, aor. 634 , (S, M, O,) 
inf. n. 4, (M, K,) He cut it off; (S, M, O, K; *) and 

1 43 signifies the same: (M, K: *) or, [app. the 

latter,] as some say, peculiarly the hand, or arm: 
(M:) one says, 4 4 3s Such a one cut off 

the hand, or arm, of such a one: (As, S, O:) 
or 44! signifies any cutting off that does not 
leave aught. (M.) — See also the next paragraph. 

2 m 3 He (a man) made a 43 [q. v .]: (K:) or so 

l 4: (TA:) and 43 45, (M, TA,) inf. n. 44 s , (TA,) 
he made, (M,) or constructed, (TA,) a 43. (M, 
TA.) [Hence,] m4 [The women's camel 

vehicles of the kind called <4 j* have dome-like, 
or tent-like, coverings made to them]. (S, O.) — 
— [Hence also,] m 3 [He (a man) made his 
back round like a dome, lowering his head]. (S

near the middle and near the end. 5 43 4ij He 
entered a 43 [q. v .]. (M, K.) 8 3 m 3 ' see 1 , near 

the end. IAar says, El- 'Okeylee used not to 

discourse of anything but I wrote it down from

did not leave with me any approved and choice

it to his own use], nor any such expression but he

senses, is 4', only: (M:) or the piece of wood

(Mgh:) it is said to be a structure of skins, or 
tanned hides, peculiarly; (M, TA;) derived 
from 44^ 44 and -44 meaning “ he collected, or 
gathered together, the extremities of the thing: ” 
(M:) accord, to IAth, it is a small round tent of 
the kind called 4Uk; of the tents of the Arabs: in 
the 'Inayeh it is said to be what is raised for the 
purpose of the entering thereinto; and not to be 
peculiarly a structure: (TA:) [also a dome-like, or 
tent-like, covering of a woman's camel-vehicle of 
the kind called <4j*: and a dome, or cupola, of 
stone or bricks: and a building covered with a 
dome or cupola:] the pi. is 444 (S, M, A, Mgh,

small, smoothish, blackish thing, the head 
of which is like that of the [beetle termed] Akiik ;

than which it is smaller; and it is said that what is 
called 44 yf- is party-coloured, black and white, 
with white legs, having a nose like that of the 
hedge-hog; when it is moved, it feigns itself dead, 
so that it appears like a [small] globular piece of 
dung; but when the voice is withheld, it goes 
away: (M, TA:) MF says that the appellation yf- 
44 is used only in poetry, in a case of necessity, 
for the sake of the metre; and is not mentioned in 
the lexicons of celebrity [except the K]. but it is 
mentioned in the M and the L: he says also that 
what is called 0*4 is said to be a species of 
the [beetles termed] 44 [pi. of A4ik] found 
between Mekkeh and El-Medeeneh: (TA:) 

[accord, to Dmr, it is a kind of six-footed insect, 
round, smaller than the black beetle, with a 
shield-shaped back, bred in moist places: 
(Golius:)] it is related on the authority of Jahidh 
that one species thereof is called 4" -W 1 , which 
is the small [species] thereof; and that the people 
of El-Yemen apply the appellation c4 to a 
certain insect, or small creeping thing, above the 
size of a locust, of the same sort as the 4“4 
[generally meaning moth]: in the Mufradat of 
Ibn-El-Beytar, it is said that what is called 
44 is also called 44 J-**-'- the reason for 
the appellation [44 4-4 seems to be because its 
back resembles a 4: (TA:) in this case is of 
the measure from 4, (S, O, K,) because the 
Arabs imperfectly decline it, and they use it 
determinately; if it were of the measure 4-4 they 
would decline it perfectly; the pi. is 44 44 (S,

sometimes it is with damm, because they make a 
change in the rel. n., as in "44- and l s j* j , which

indicates that the regular form, with kesr, is the

a particle: (S, O, Mughnee, K:) and as a noun it is 

used in two ways. (Mughnee, K.) (I) It is a 

noun syn. with (s, O, Mughnee, K;) 

generally used indeclinably; (Mughnee, K;) 
thus accord, to the Basrees; with the a quiescent; 
(TA;) because resembling aa the particle in 
respect of the letters composing it, and many 
other particles in respect of its form, (Mughnee, 
TA,) such as If and 3 j & c.: (TA:) one says, ajj aa 
f*ja [The sufficiency of Zeyd (i. e. what 
is sufficient for Zeyd) is a dirhem], (Mughnee, K,) 
with the a quiescent; (Mughnee, * K, * TA;) 
and L^aa (S, O) and ^as (S, O, Mughnee) 
[both] meaning ^ 4 4 k [My sufficiency (i. e. what is 
sufficient for me)]; (S, O;) the u in ^a^ being 
inserted in order to preserve the quiescence [of 
the final letter of the noun] because this is the 
original characteristic of what they make 
indeclinable; (Mughnee;) but the insertion of 
the u in this case is anomalous, for it is [by rule] 
only added in verbs, by way of precaution, [to 
prevent the confusion of the pronominal affix of 
the verb and that of the noun,] as in (S, 

O:) [see, however, in the next sentence, an 
explanation of ^a* accord, to which the u is 
inserted regularly:] accord, to Yaakoob, using as 
in the sense of one says, ass Ik Yl csa ie .ill U 
i. e. kia [There is nothing for thee with me, 
or nothing due to thee in my possession, except 


this, and it is a thing sufficient, or it is 
enough, kia being held to signify 

properly but it is commonly used as 

meaning and no more]; and he asserts it [i. e. aa] 
to be a substitute [for J=a]: (M:) and it is also used 
declinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord, to the 
Koofees; (TA;) but this is rare: (Mughnee:) one 
says 4 J -A making it marfooa, (Mughnee, K,) like 
as one says -kkk; and without u [as 
mentioned above,] like as one says 

(Mughnee.) (2) It is also a verbal noun, syn. 

with one says, f* ja lajj aa [A dirhem suffices, 

or will suffice, Zeyd], and f* ja ^as [A dirhem 
suffices, or will suffice, me]; (Mughnee, K;) 
like as one says f*ja lajj e^kj, and f»ja 
(Mughnee, K. *) — As a particle, it is used 
peculiarly with a verb, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] 
as such it is not preposed to anything except a 
verb, (S, O,) either a pret. or an aor., (TA,) from 
which it is not separated unless by an oath, 
(Mughnee,) such as is perfectly inflected, 
enunciative, (Mughnee, K,) not an imperative, 
(TA,) affirmative, and free from anything 
that would render it mejzoom or man- soob, and 
from what is termed <_j jk [i. e. and its 
variants]: and it has six meanings. (Mughnee, K.) 

(1) It denotes expectation: (M, Mughnee, 

K:) and when it is with an aor., this is evident; 
(Mughnee;) one says MjUll faaj as, (Mughnee, 
K,) meaning It is expected that the absent will 
come: (TA:) and most affirm that it is thus used 
with a pret.: (Mughnee:) accord, to some, (M,) 
it is used in reply to the saying 3*4 1*1 [i. e. “ He 
has not yet done ” such a thing, which implies 
expectation that he would do it]; (S, M, O;) the 
reply being, 3 *sas [Already he has done the thing]: 
(M:) and Kh asserts that it is used in reply to 
persons expecting information; (S, M, * O, 
Mughnee;) [for to such] you say, aa*-* aa 
[Already such a one has died]; but if one inform 
him who does not expect it, he does not say thus, 
but he says [merely] ciiU ; (s, O:) thus some 
say _»?VI skj aa [Already the commander has 
mounted his horse] to him who expects 
his mounting: some, however, disallow that aa is 
used to denote expectation with the pret. because 
the pret. denotes what is already past; and 
hence it appears that those who affirm it to be so 
used mean that the pret. denotes what was 
expected before the information: (Mughnee: [in 
which it is added, with some other observations, 
that, in the opinion of its author, it does not 
denote expectation even with the aor.; because 
the saying m^JI faaj denotes expectation 
without aa : ]) MF says, What we have been orally 
taught by the sheykhs in ElAndalus is this, that it 



2500 Digitized Text Version VI. 1 


[BOOKI.] 


is a particle denoting the affirmation of truth, or 
certainty, when it occurs before a pret., and a 
particle denoting expectation when it occurs 
before a future. (TA.) — — (2) It denotes the 
nearness of the past to the present: (O, Mughnee, 
K:) so in the saying J La [Zeyd has just, or just 
now, stood; a meaning often intended by saying 
merely, has stood]; (Mughnee, K;) for this phrase 
without aa may mean the near past and the 
remote past; (Mughnee;) and so in the saying of 
the muedhdhin, cjili La [The time of the 

rising to prayer has just come, or simply has 
come]: (O:) [and, when thus used, it is 
often immediately preceded by the pret. or aor. of 
the verb lJ; thus you say, i La JS He had just, 
or simply had, gone away; and m 4 - La uJ) 
He will, or shall, have just, or simply have gone 
away:] and accord, to the Basrees, except Akh, it 
must be either expressed or 
understood immediately before a pret. used as a 
denotative of state; as in [the saying in the Kur ii. 
247,] Hjlya ' A ^ ' Laj 4lil Jjllj VI lil lij 

djdji j [And what reason have we that we should 
not fight in the cause of God when we have been 
expelled from our abodes and our children?]; and 
in [the saying in the Kur iv. 92,] j jjLk jl 

J [Or who come to you, their 
bosoms being contracted so that they are 
incapable of fighting you, or their bosoms 
shrinking from fighting you]; but the Koofees and 
Akh says that this is not required, because of the 
frequent occurrence of the pret. as a denotative of 
state without La, and [because] the primary rule is 
that there should be no meaning, or making, 
anything to be understood, more especially in 
the case of that which is in frequent use: 
(Mughnee:) Sb [however] does not allow the use 
of the pret. as a denotative of state without La; 
and he makes to be an 

imprecation [meaning may their bosoms 
become contracted]: (S in art. >-=*=>•; in which art. 
in the present work see more on this subject:) 
and the inceptive J is prefixed to it like of 
the saying, J jal lijj jl [Verily Zeyd has just 
stood, or has stood]; because the primary rule is 
that it is to be prefixed to the noun, and it is 
prefixed to the aor. because it resembles the 
noun, and when the pret. denotes a time near to 
the present it resembles the aor. and therefore it 
is allowable to prefix it thereto. (Mughnee.) [See 
also the two sentences next after what is 

mentioned below as the sixth meaning.] (3) 

It denotes rareness, or paucity; (Mughnee, K;) 
either of the act signified by the verb, (Mughnee,) 
as in [the saying], v 1 jL&ll La [in some few 

instances the habitual liar speaks truth]; 
(Mughnee, K;) or of what is dependent upon that 


l3 

act, as in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse,] La 
U jllij [as though] meaning J U ji 
<jU jlxi Jal ji [ so that it should be rendered At 
least He knoweth that state of conduct and mind 
to which ye are conforming yourselves]: but some 
assert that in these exs. and the like thereof it 
denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty; [as 
will be shown hereafter;] and that the denoting of 
rareness, or paucity, in the former ex. is 
not inferred from La, but from the saying m J£ ll 

3-A^ij. (Mughnee.) (4) It denotes frequency; 

(Mughnee, K;) [i. e.] sometimes (S, O) it is used 
as syn. with Jj [as denoting frequency, as well 
as with in the contr. sense, mentioned in the 
next preceding sentence]: (S, M, O:) thus in the 
saying (S, M, O, Mughnee, K) of the Hudhalee, 
(M, Mughnee,) or 'Abeed Ibn-El-Abras, (IB, 
TA,) -dfbi jjall iljji La [Often I leave the 

antagonist having his fingers’ ends become 
yellow]. (S, M, O, Mughnee, K.) — — (5) It 
denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty: 
thus in [the saying in the Kur xci. 9,] j™ La 
j [Verily, or certainly, or indeed, or really, he 
prospereth, or will prosper, who purifieth it; 
(namely, his soul;) each pret. here occupying the 
place of a mejzoom aor.]: (Mughnee, K:) and thus 
accord, to some in [the saying in the Kur xxiv. 
last verse, of which another explanation has been 
given above,] fjii U ^ La [Verily, or certainly, 
&c., He knoweth that state of conduct and mind 
to which ye are conforming yourselves]. 
(Mughnee.) — — (6) It denotes negation, 
(Mughnee, K,) accord, to ISd, (Mughnee,) 
occupying the place of J (M,) in the saying, La 
^ Jla jli. cliiS, (M, Mughnee, K,) with — *> 
mansoob, [as though meaning Thou wast not in 
prosperity, that thou shouldst know 
it,] (Mughnee, K,) heard from one of the chaste in 

speech: (M:) but this is strange. (Mughnee.) 

[When it is used to denote the nearness of the 
past to the present, as appears to be indicated by 
the context in the O,] La may be separated from 
the verb by an oath; as in Cn - A i -dllj ia [Thou 
hast, by God, done well] and I cjy ^ yAl La [1 
have, by my life, or by my religion, passed the 
night sleepless]. (O, Mughnee. [In the latter, this 
and what here next follows are mentioned before 
the explanations of the meanings of the particle; 
probably because the meaning in these cases can 
hardly be mistaken.]) And the verb may 
be suppressed after it, (M, * O, Mughnee,) when 
its meaning is apprehended, (O,) or because of an 
indication; (Mughnee;) as in the saying of En- 
Nabighah (M, O, Mughnee) Edh-Dhubyanee, 
(O,) Ja JSj GIU. jj J jj Ul Ujl£ j ji jjfe J. Jil iai [The 
time of departure has drawn near, though the 
camels that we ride have not left with our utensils 


and apparatus for travelling, but it is as though 
they had (left)]; meaning Lull j ja u^. (M, O, 
Mughnee.) — — If you make La an Jj [i. e. a 
subst. or a proper name], you characterize it by 
teshdeed: therefore you say, lLa Cm £ [1 wrote 
a beautiful aa] ; and so you do in the case of J> 
and > and j because these words have no 
indication of what is deficient in them [supposing 
them to be originally of three radical 
letters], therefore it is requisite to add to the last 
letter of each what is of the same kind as it, and 
this is incorporated into it: but not in the case 
of I; for in this case you add *; thus if you name a 
man V, or Li, and then add at the end of it I, you 
make it *; for you make the second I movent, 
and I when movent becomes *: (S, O:) so says J, 
[and Sgh has followed him in the O,] and such is 
the opinion of Akh and of a number of the 
grammarians of El-Basrah [and of El-Koofeh 
(MF)], and F has quoted this passage in the B 
and left it uncontradicted: but IB says, (TA,) [and 
after him F in the K,] this is a mistake: that only 
is characterized by teshdeed of which the last 
letter is infirm: you say, for >, (IB, K,) used as 
the name of a man, (IB,) 3 *, (IB, K,) and for j! 
you say jl, and for J 1 you say J ; (IB;) and such is 
characterized by teshdeed only in order that the 
word may not be reduced to one letter on account 
of the quiescence of the infirm letter [which 
would disappear] with tenween [as it does in J 
and Ly &c.]: (K:) but as to La, if you use it as a 
name, you say Js; (IB, K;) and for 6* you say o*, 
and for jo you say Jq (K;) like 4 * (IB, K) and J 
&c.: (K:) F, however, [following IB,] is wrong in 
calling J’s statement a mistake; though the rule 
given by him [and IB] is generally preferred. 
(MF, TA.) La The skin of a lamb or kid: (M, A, L,

heard persons reciting and making themselves

l3 

the Kur [lxxv. 17 and 18 ], 'ala ^ jaj tile jj 

441 ja iUi ja means Verily on us is the collecting 

thereof [i. e. of the Kur-an] and the reciting 
thereof; and when we recite it, then follow thou 
the reciting thereof: or, accord, to I'Ab, and when 
we explain it to thee, then do thou according to 
that which we have explained to thee: (S, O, TA:)

on us is the collecting thereof in thy mind, and 
the fixing the recitation thereof on thy tongue; 
and when we recite it to thee by the tongue of 
Gabriel, then follow thou the reciting thereof, and 
often recur therein so that it may become firmly 
rooted in thy understanding: (Bd:) 

[therefore -di ja j n the former instance means the 
teaching thee to recite it; and thus we 
may explain the assertion that] Ija and J, I jal are 
syn. in like manner as are 44 ja ^ and (Sb, 

TA.) See 4 . <&■ ['3 means He read, or recited, to 
him the Kur-an, &c., [as a teacher, or an 
informant; (as is shown by phrases in the Kur

a conventional and post-classical phrase,] as a 
pupil, or learner, to his sheykh, or preceptor.

phrase is not used unless the salutation is 
written: (K, TA:) or belongs to a particular dial.; 
and is used when the salutation is written, 
meaning he made him to read the salutation: 
(AHat, TA:) the aor. of the verb in the 
former phrase is Ija, and the inf. n. is »*ija: As 
says that the making that verb trans. by itself is a 
mistake; therefore one should not say il jal

salutation]. (Msb.) See also 5 . — And see 4 ,

anomalous, for \ 1*jI j? ^ (TA in the present

manifest. (TA in art. jja.) [And accord, to 
Freytag, (app. in the phrase lid cjI jal,) the verb is 
expl. in the Kitab el-Addad as said of a serpent,

menstrual discharge. (Akh, S, O, TA.) [Accord, to 
Zj, as I gather from the TA, the second of 
the significations in the sentence immediately 
preceding is from the collection of the blood in 
the womb: in the opinion of IAth, it and the first 
signification are from relation to time: but I 
rather incline to think that the converse of this is 
the case, and that hence are deduced several 

other meanings here following.] £la jll 'I jal

eagerness of desire for safety [is more, or most, 
shrewd]: (TA:) [this rendering, however, requires 
consideration; for, accord, to Meyd, who gives 
only the reading the meaning of the prov.

J

away from his possession is more shrewd than he 
who causes, or suffers, the m 1 '3 also to pass away

days distant; the second day being called 3^*: (K:

authorities, and agreeable with the derivation of 
each of the two words: see 3^:]) or the night

water: (TA:) and 31)1 is the night in which 
people with their camels hasten to the water in 
a journey such as is termed Mja; this 

latter term being applied to signify a people's 
letting their camels pasture while they 
are journeying towards water; and when there 
remains an evening between them and the water, 
hastening towards it: (S, O:) or, as is said on 
the authority of As, ^3*11 31)1 is the second night 
after the pastor has turned the faces of his camels 
towards the water, and so left them to pasture; 
this second night being the night of hard driving; 
and the first night being called 3^' 3£J ; accord, 
to AA, [the journey called] is [the journey to 
water] during three days, or more. (TA.) 
And [hence] m 3^ is used to signify What is a 
night's journey distant. (S in art. m 3, in 


explanation of a verse cited in that art. [Or,

this sense it receives the fem. form, by universal 
consent; so that you say, csaA j4l [This 
woman is my relation]: (Fr, S, O, Msb: *) and 
likewise the dual form; so that you say, [ 04yA Ik* 
and] O^aA Ui [They two are relations]: (AA, 
Msb:) [and it has a ph, namely, ilyjal;] you say, j*

relations; and the second and third, properly, 
being pis. of J, a A', They are my nearer, or 
nearest, or very near, relations; though in the T 
the second is said to be pi. of 4 aA; and in most of

Msb without any distinction of meaning) are all 
to be understood in the latter sense]: and yjs 
[also] is a pi. of CyA [app. in the sense here

accord, to Z, 4 j* is allowable, 

being accounted for as a phrase in which the 
prefixed n. [ A] is suppressed; and it has 
moreover been asserted to be correct and chaste 
in verse and prose: 4 ^ A also occurs in the trads. 
in the sense of jAi : it is said in the Nh to be an 
inf. n. used as an epithet, agreeably with general 
analogy: and in the Tes-heel it is said to be a 
quasi-pl. n. of 4 -aA, like as A'-=— => is of 4 
(MF, TA:) [accord, to Mtr,] 4 ^A is correctly 
applicable to one and to a pi. number, as being 
originally an inf. n.; so that one says, a^A j* 
and a^A j*; though the chaste phrase is a)! A A 
applied to one; and a^A Iji, to two; 

and a)Ia jA, to a pi. number. (Mgh.) And

near relationship]. (A.) — — It signifies also 
Near, or allied, by affection and friendship. (TA

thou leave them, thou wilt not be safe from them,

them and injure them, they will revile thee and

is [said to be] inaccurate; for the leaves are 
called AA, and camels are fed with them, and 
they are not used for tanning: some say, that it is 
a kind of tree; but this also is inaccurate; for one 
says, “I plucked, or gathered, A ja ; ” and trees are 
not plucked, or gathered: (Msb:) AHn 

[contradicts this, however, for he applies this 
word to a kind of tree, and] says, it is the best of 
things with which hides are tanned in the land of 
the Arabs; and these are tanned with its 
leaves and its fruit: [the pods of the AA, which is 
also called A ja, are used for tanning;] and in one 


place he says, it is a large kind of trees, having 
thick stems (jr- [app. a mistranscription 
for thorns,]) resembling the walnut-tree, [in 
the Mgh, evidently from the same source, “or, as 
some say, a large kind of trees, having thick 
thorns (AjA), resembling the walnut-tree,”] the 
leaves of which are smaller than those of the 
apple-tree, and it has grains which are put into 
balances [for weights, like as are those of the 
carob-tree]: it grows in the low plains: (TA:) or a 
kind of tree, whereof the AA [mimosa Nilotica, 
also called acacia Nilotica,] is a species: (M, K, in 
art. Au~> : ) [or,] correctly speaking, it is [the fruit, 
or seed with its pericarp, of that tree;] a well- 
known grain, which comes forth in envelopes, 
like lentils, from the trees called »LAc.; (Msb;) or, 
[to speak more precisely,] the fruit of the AA, 
whence is expressed Ail [acacia, i. e. 
succus acacias]; (K;) which is termed A jail s jU^c., 
[and when inspissated, 4 =J*M A j,] and has an 
acrid property; the best thereof is that which 
is sweet in odour, heavy, hard, and green; and it 
strengthens relaxed members, when cooked in 
water, and poured upon them: (Ibn-Jezleh, 
TA:) [the last application is that which commonly 
obtains in the present day: see also 'Abd-el- 
Lateef, pp. 48-52 of the Arabic text, and De 
Sacy's translation and notes:] the n. un. is Aja :

plucked it up and took it, in order that he might 
be known to be the one who outstripped,

quick, and light, or active: (Msb, * TA:) [accord, 
to the TA, it is a tropical phrase, but perhaps it is 
so only when used in the latter way:] it is said in a

horse-course with the cane, making it to be a 
hundred canes in length, and the cane was stuck 
upright in the ground at the goal, and he who was 
first in arriving at it took it, and was entitled to 

the stake. (O, TA. [See also 44i.]) [The 

l 4-4 here mentioned as A certain measure 
of length, used in measuring race-courses, was 
also used in other cases, in measuring land, and 
differed in different countries and in

(see 4:j4) accord, to others, six cubits and a 
third of a cubit: (see 34) the modern 

Egyptian 44s, until it was reduced some years

the reason which has been explained in treating 
of 3, (s, TA,) to preserve the original quiescence 
of the 4; (Mughnee;) and J=3; (S, Msb, 
Mughnee;) and j 43; (S;) and J, 4143, (s, M, K,) 
like jJ-43, (s, K,) indecl.; (M;) as signifying ^^4=: 
(S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K:) and, as is said in the 
Moo'ab, £* j< <111 4c 43 The sufficiency of 'Abd- 
Allah is a dirhem; [and the like is said by Lth and 
in the Mughnee;] pausing upon the 4, and 
making 43 to govern a gen. case [as it does 
virtually in the preceding instances]; and the 
Basrees say, that this is the right mode, as 
meaning the like of f* j-> 3 j -4==. and f* 3 j J&-, 

(K:) or some say 43, with jezm; and some say J, 43, 
making it inded. with damm for its 
termination; each governing what follows it in 

the gen. case. (M.) It is also a verbal noun, 

signifying J&i [it suffices, or will suffice; or it 
is, or will be, sufficient]; and when this is the 
case, you say, ^4=3, (Mughnee, K,) like as you 
say, ^434 [it suffices me, or will suffice me]; 
(Mughnee;) or ^4^ [which means, emphatically, 
it suffices me], accord, to the Koofees; (Lth;) 
which is also allowable when 45 is equivalent 
to u4 [as we have observed above]: (Mughnee:) 
and you say also, 44s, meaning 4U£ 
[emphatically It suffices thee]: 
and es-43, meaning ^4^ [emphatically It suffices 
me]: (K:) so in the copies of the K; [in the CK, 
erroneously, l 643;] but [it seems that it should 
be ^4=3; f or ] [t is said in the Mughnee and its 
Expositions, that in this last case the addition of 
the u is indispensable: (MF:) and some say, 3c 43 
f* j< <31 [A dirhem suffices, or will suffice, 'Abd- 


Allah (in the CK, erroneously, 43)]; making it to 
govern the accus. case [as it does virtually in 
preceding instances]: and some add u, saying, 3c 
u43 l fijj <111 [meaning the same]: (Lth, K:) 
[hence,] some say, that [u43 in] ^4=3 [ s a worc j 
originally thus formed without any 
augmentation, like [m 4= in] ^56=-; (M;) [but J 
says,] if the u in ^^=43 belonged to the root of the 
word, they had said 3143, which is not known. 

(S.) It is also syn. with y4 in the phrase 4 

433 j s 'y. Y] <3i j [I have not seen him, or it, 
save once, and that was a thing sufficient or that 
was enough]: (S, Msb: *) or, as is said in the 
Mutowwel, 43 in -433 is a verbal noun, meaning 
abstain thou [from further questioning, or 
the like], as though it were the complement of a 
condition suppressed [such as “ the case being so 
”]: or, as is said in the Mesail of Ibn-Es- 
Seed, the 4 i$ properly prefixed because the 
meaning is and I was satisfied, or content, 
therewith; so that the 4 is a conjunction: (from a 
marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) [it 
therefore virtually signifies and no more; or only; 
and thus it may often be rendered: and this 
explains what here follows:] when 43 is used to 
denote paucity, (M, K,) which is said by El- 
Hareeree, in the Durrah, to be only in negative 
phrases, (MF,) it is [written 43,] with jezm, (M, 
K,) and without teshdeed: (M:) you say, VI 33c U 
43 1 4 [which may be rendered Thou hast not save 
this only]: but when it is followed by a 
conjunctive I, it is with kesr; [as in the saying,] 4 
f>j3l 43 14 VI Ciilc [virtually mean- ing I knew 
not, or, emphatically, know not, save this only, 
to-day]: (K:) and also, (K,) when thus using it, 
(M,) you say, 4^^ 43 »j4c VI <i 4 
[likewise virtually meaning He has not save ten 
only, O young man], without teshdeed, and with 
jezm; and \ 43, with teshdeed and khafd; (Lh, M, 
K;) the kesreh of the latter, in a case of this kind, 
being to distinguish the 43 which denotes 
[paucity of] number from 43, which denotes 
time. (Lth.) — See also 43, first sentence. 43: 
see 43. 43 : see 43: — and see also 43. 4S : 
see -43. 43: see -43. 43: see 43. 45: see 43. 43 is an 
adv. noun, (Mughnee,) [generally] denoting time, 
(S, M, Mughnee,) or past time, (Msb, K,) used to 
include all past time; (Lth, Mughnee;) as also 
J, 43, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) the former vowel being 
assimilated to the latter; (S, Mughnee;) and j 43, 
(S, M, Mughnee, K,) and j 43; (S, Mughnee, * K;) 
and some say J, 43, (S, Mughnee,) whence 43 is 
formed, by making its termination similar to that 
of the primary form 43, to show its origin; (S, M;) 
or this would be better than 43; (M;) and j 43, 
(S, M, Mughnee, *) like 4, which is rare: (S, M:) 
of all these, the first is the most chaste:

added, “and with refa to the -1=; ” to which is 
further added in the CK, “without teshdeed: ” but 
I find two copies without any addition of this 
redundant kind: for by “ refa ” is here meant, as 
in a former instance, “damm; ”

in the time that is past; (Msb, K;) or in what has 
been cut off of my life; (Mughnee, K;) its 
derivation being from c33=3 meaning “ I cut; ” for 
the past is cut off from the present and the 
future; and it is indecl. because it implies the 
meaning of -3 and 4!; its meaning being =3 
jYI oili. jl [since my being created until 
now]; and with a vowel for its termination to 
prevent the occurrence of two quiescent 
letters together; (Mughnee;) and it is with refa 
[meaning damm for its termination] because it is 
like J=5 and 2*): (Lth:) accord, to Ks, (S,) -1=5 is a 
contraction of -1=1=2: (S, M:) Sb says, that it 
denotes 34==YI; [app. meaning that it signifies 
abstain thou from further questioning, or the 
like; for El-Hareeree says, in the Durrah, that -1=2

is indecl., with damm for its termination, 
like 43=. (M.) You say also, 1=5 Yj 3=3 13 U

art., it is 3#4.) 24 [part. n. of 24 in all

one of them, he did really good and great actions,

hence jSill [applied to God] in the Kur, lix. 23: 
the other, he affected to do such actions, and

praiseworthy: the other, he boasted of qualities 
which he did possess, and feigned such qualities;

attribute of men, in the Kur, x. 79, where it is said 
to signify proud behaviour towards others, (Bd,) 
or dominion: (IAmb, Bd, Jel:) and both signify 
pride, haughtiness, or insolence: (K:) or the 
former, self-admiration, or self-conceit; and the 
holding one’s self greater than others: and the 1 
latter, disdain of submission; an attribute to

with the person addressed, and in the sense of 
the imperative. 44 here [lit.] signifies Let them 
render thee active, or brisk, and animate thee, 
instigate thee, or incite thee. (Z.). [A trad, of 
'Omar, quoted below, presents another instance 

to which this signification is said to apply.] 

Or 44 denotes instigation, or incitement, of the 
person addressed, to keep to the thing that 
is mentioned; as in the saying of the Arabs, 44 
3=41 44 meaning Eat thou honey: but the 
explanation of this is, (The relinquisher of) 
honey hath erred [to thee; i. e., in his 
representation of its evil qualites &c.; which is 
equivalent to saying, Eat, or keep to, 
honey]: 3=41 being put for 3=^1 4 Ji. [See also l 
in art. 3=*=.] In like manner, the saying of 
'Omar, 5=d' 44 ==4 &c., (see below,) signifies 
Keep ye to the performance of the pilgrimage, 
& c.: [or (the relinquisher of) the pilgrimage hath 
erred to thee in his representation of it: therefore 
it means as above]. (IAmb.) Accord, to IAmb the 
noun signifying the object of instigation [which 
may also be called the cause thereof] cannot 
be rightly put in the acc. case: if so put, the verb 
is without an agent. (TA.) [But see what is said on 
this point in the remarks on the trad, of 'Omar 

below.] Or the verb in a case of this kind 

signifies 343 thus, §4' 44 signifies The 
performance of the pilgrimage is possible, or 
practicable, to thee: therefore [it means] Perform 
thou the pilgrimage. (ISh.) — — Or (14*1 is its 
original signification; and the meaning intended 

is Keep to; as in the ex. 34^ =4 (Aal.) 

'Antarah, addressing his wife 'Ableh, says; or, 
accord, to some, the poet is Khuzaz Ibn- 
Lowdhan; ^4-= =4 u! 4= o= j 3#4 

(TA.) i. e., Keep thou to the eating of dates, 
and to the cool water of an old, worn-out, skin: if 
thou ask me for an evening's drink of milk, 
depart: for I have appropriated the milk to my 
colt, which is profitable to me, and may preserve 
me and thee: (L:) 344 is in the nom. case accord, 
to the dial, of El-Yemen: but in the acc. accord, to 
that of Mudar. (TA.) — — Er-Radee 

[reading 344] cites this verse as a proof that =4 
originally a verb, has become a verbal noun, 
signifying f 34 (TA.) But he is the only one who 

asserts it to be a verbal noun. (MF.) Also, 

Mo'akkir El-Barikee says, u4 4== ==4jl <#44 
Uiljal 1 #4 And many a woman of 
Dhubyan charged her sons by [saying], Keep to 
the red garments (<=40, and the bags 
(or receptacles) of leather tanned with 
pomegranate-bark. She charged them to take 
plenty of these two things as spoil from the tribe 


of Nemir, if they should prevail over them. 

(Aboo-'Obeyd El-Kasim Ibn-Selam.) ==4 is 

also said to have the same meaning in the words 
of the trad. #4 [Keep to those skilled in 

genealogy:] or Regard is to be had to what is said 
by those skilled in genealogy: another meaning to 

which is assigned below. (TA.) It sometimes 

signifies It is incumbent, or obligatory. So in the 
following: (a trad, of 'Omar: TA:) 44 j43c 44 

[The performance of the pilgrimage is incumbent 
on you: the performance of (the rites called) » >“41 
is incumbent on you: warring (for the sake 
of religion) is incumbent on you: three 

expeditions are incumbent on you]: (S, * K:) 
or #4 here, is from <=3 “ his soul made 

him to desire things, and to conceive hopes, that 
could scarcely come to pass; ” and the meaning is 
let [the expectation of the reward which 
will follow] the performance of the pilgrimage 
render thee active, or brisk, and animate thee, 
instigate thee, or incite thee, to the act: [and so 
of the rest of the trad.: but here I should observe, 
that, for 4-4=1 and 44=;] anc j ,=£*3. i n the CK, we 
should read 44^ &c.:] (K:) — — or, as ISk 
says, =4 here, seems to denote instigation, or 
incitement, meaning 4 4=lc keep ye to it; and is 

an extr. word with respect to analogy: (S:) 

accord, to Akh., jj=4 is governed in the nom. case 
by =4 but as to the meaning, it is in the acc.; 
because the meaning is a command to perform 
the pilgrimage; as when you say, 4411 433 [“ the 
game hath become within thy power, or reach ”], 
meaning “ shoot it, ” or “ cast at it: ” (S:) he who 
puts 5=4 in the acc. case, [agreeably with one 
relation of the trad., TA,] makes -44 [or 44] 
a verbal noun; and in #4 is [implied] the 
pronoun which refers to 5=4 [and which is the 
agent of the verb]; (K;) or the agent is implied 
in 44 and explained by what follows it; (Sb;) [so 
that] the meaning is 5=4 44 sy4 44 (Z:) or, 
[as shown above,] #4 is a verbal n., meaning f jit, 
and 5=4 i s i n the acc. case as governed by it: (Er- 
Radee:) though its being in the acc. case, accord, 
to some, is altogether unknown: (TA:) — -b29- 
[or the meaning is as stated before on the 
authority of ISh.:] — -b30- or the trad, 
means <4 tai 4-= =il3 jic. 4 4= 3 -^*11 Air. 
==>>4 =>-> [(the relinguisher of) the pilgrimage 
hath erred to thee if it have been spoken of (by 
him) as not sufficient, (and as not) abolishing the 
sins, or offences, (committed) before it: agreeably 
with the explanation by IAmb, given above]. (K.) 
— -b3i- 44 He said what was false 

unintentionally; committed a mistake, or error. 


The verb is used in this sense by the people of El- 
Hijaz, and the rest of the Arabs have followed 
them in so using it. (Towsheeh.) — #4 is also 
said to signify He spoke truth; so as to bear 
two contr. meanings: and thus, jjjU4l 44 may 
signify Those skilled in genealogy have spoken 
truth: but another explanation of this saying 
is given in this art. (MF, &c.) — 4314 Cu4 [and 
the like] Thou brokest wind. (S in art. 34) 2 <4, 
inf. n. 4jiS3 ; (and 44 TA, and 44 [like 44= 
&c.], occurring in the TA, voce 44, &c.) He made, 
or pronounced, him a liar; an utterer of 
falsehood; or a sayer of what was untrue: (K:) he 
attributed, or ascribed, to him lying, 
untruth, mendacity, or the speaking untruth: 
(Msb:) and (Msb) [accused him of lying:] he gave 
him the lie; said to him, “ Thou hast lied, ” &c.

A 


(Msb.) [The verb when used in this sense, seems, 
from what has been said above, to be a 
<43^, or word so much used in a particular 
tropical sense as to be, in that sense, 
conventionally regarded as proper.] — — And 
hence, j&, inf. n. i3j® 4 is used to signify 
[absolutely] He denied, or 

disacknowledged. (TA.) [See the act. part, n., 
below: and see 3. See also art. p. 2322 a.] You 

say He denied the Creator. (Msb.) 

Hence also, (TA.) J&, (S, Msb,) aor. (Msb, 
TA,) inf. n. 3“, (S, Msb, K,) which is the most 
common form in this case, (El-Basair,) and 
(K) and u'jai (Msb, K) and jj^, (K,) He 
disbelieved; he became an unbeliever, or infidel; 
contr. of a*\ inf. n. (S, K.) You say <114 3®3> 
(S, Msb) He disbelieved in God: (S:) because he 
who does so conceals, or covers, the truth, and 
the favours of the liberal Dispenser of favours 
[who is God]. (MF.) [Also, as shown above, He 
denied God.] It is related in a trad, of 'Abd-El- 
Melik, that he wrote to El- Hajjaj, jaSil^ jal 
<4fy, meaning, Whosoever confesses the unbelief 
of him who opposes the Benoo-Marwan, and 
goes forth against them, let him go his way. (TA.) 
See also 3®4 below. — — [He blasphemed: 
a signification very common in the present day.] 

Also, laL jaS He declared himself to be clear, 

or quit, of such a thing. (Msb.) In this sense it is 

used in the Kur xiv. 27. (Msb, TA.) And ja£ 

also signifies He was remiss, or fell short of his 
duty, with respect to the law, and neglected the 
gratitude or thankfulness to God which 
was incumbent on him. So in the Kur xxx. 43; as 
is shown by its being opposed to (TA.) 

— <1 jaS, inf. n. 3®4 see 2.2* .44 inf. n. 3#4 see 
1, first signification, in three places. — Hence, 3®3> 
Cjjill it (war in the cause of God [or the like]) 
covered, or concealed, the crime or sin: (Mgh:) 
(or expiated it: or annulled it; for] j4^3 with 
respect to acts of disobedience is like -1=144 
with respect to reward. (S, K.) The saying in the 
Kur [v. 70.] ffric- UjaSl means. We would 

cover, or conceal, their sins, so that they should 
become as though they had not been: or it may 
mean. We would do away with their sins; as is 
indicated by another saying in the Kur [xi. 116,] “ 
good actions do away with sins. ” (El-Basair.) 3^ 
kjc. <111 signifies God effaced his sin. (Msb.) 

And <3" if- [He expiated his oath;] he 

performed, (Msb,) or gave, (K,) what is 
termed [i. e. a fast, or alms, for the expiation 
of his oath]: (Msb, K:) 34^3 of an oath is the doing 
what is incumbent, or obligatory, for 
the violation, or breaking, thereof: (S:) <4 “j 4^ is 
a vulgar phrase. (Mgh.) — Vyi as syn. with 


see 4. — <3 3®% inf. n. 343“3, (A, Mgh, TA,) He did 
obeisance to him, lowering his head, or bowing, 
and bending himself, and putting his hand upon 
his breast: (Mgh:) or put his hand upon his 
breast and bent himself down to him: (TA:) or he 
made a sign of humbling himself to him; did 
obeisance to him: (A:) namely, an 5I4 [or 
unbeliever of the Persians or other foreigners] (A, 
Mgh) or a (44 [or free non- Muslim subject of a 
Muslim government, i. e., a Christian, a Jew, or a 
Sabian] (Mgh) to the king; (A, Mgh;) or a slave to 
his master, or to his [or chief]: (TA:) and 
[ 3“, [aor. 3“, accord, to the rule of of the K,] 
(TK,) inf. n. 3®4 (K,) he (a Persian, J*, K, and 
so in the L and other lexicons, but in the 
TS 0= J4 without lS, which is probably a mistake 
of copyists, TA) paid honour to his king, (K, TA,) 
by making a sing with his head, near to 
prostration: (TA:) 34^3 is a man's humbling 
himself to another, (S, K, TA,) bending himself, 
and lowering his head, nearly in the manner 
termed £j4j; as one does when he desires to pay 
honour to his friend; (TA;) or as the (4^ does to 
the O'-**- 3 : (S:) and the j433> of the people of the 
scriptures [or Christians and Jews, and Sabians] 
one's lowering his head to his friend, like the 
with the Muslims: or one's putting his hand, 
or his two hands, upon his breast: (TA:) and 
in prayer is the bending one's self much in the 
state of standing, before the action 
termed j^j; the doing of which was disapproved 
by Mohammad, accord, to a trad. (TA.) It is said 
in a trad., 4JS 44 jla 4 jjl 131 

When the son of Adam rises in the morning, 
verily all the members abase themselves to the 
tongue, (Mgh, TA,) and confess obedience to it, 

and humbly submit to its command. (TA.) 

344 also signifies The crowning a king with a 
crown, [because] when he, or it, is 
seen, obeisance is done to him (<3 'J * j lit). (K.) 

See also 344 below. 3 ^4=“- c43®^“ He denied, 

or disacknowledged, to me my right, or just 
claim. (A, Mgh, K.) Hence the saying of 'Amir, '3] 
3at£ p -33? 3al [When he confesses a 

thing in the presence of the Kadee, then denies, 
or disacknowledges: 3®^ being thus used in the 
sense of 3®4I- But as to the saying of Mohammad 
[the lawyer], 0)3 ji-i Jc. 34 j [A 

man who owed to another a debt, and denied to

Mgh, K,) and J, » j®4 (A, Mgh, Msb,) [the latter of 
which is the more common in the present day,]

unbeliever, or an infidel]: (S, Mgh, K:) he 
attributed, or imputed to him, charged him with, 
or accused him of, disbelief, or infidelity: (S, A, 
Msb:) or he said to him dijlS [Thou hast become 
an unbeliever, or infidel, or Thou 
hast blasphemed: in this last sense, “ he said to 
him Thou hast blasphemed, ” » 44 to which alone 
it is assigned in the Msb, is very commonly used 
in the present day]. (Msb.) Hence the saying, V 
Jil I3=J 33S3 Do not thou attribute or 
impute disbelief or infidelity to any one of 
the people of thy kibleh; (S, TA;) i. e., do not thou 
call any such a disbeliever, &c.; or do not thou 
make him such by thine assertion and thy saying. 
(TA.) f4ij| Ji i I jjISj 4 is not authorized by the 
relation, though it be allowable as a dial. form. 

(Mgh.) [Also] <3(M inf. n. 3-®4, 1 made him 

a disbeliever, an unbeliever, or an infidel; 
I compelled him to become a disbeliever, &c. 
(Msb.) And = jits jlSi Such a one compelled

Earth, or dust; because it conceals what is

the saying, j44 34 61 44“ [O God, pardon the 

people of the graves]. (S.) — [And hence,

upon it: if cattle eat of it before that, they die: 
wherefore Mohammad forbade pasturing by 
night: but sometimes a camel runs away, and eats 
of such pasture before sunrise, and dies in

purposed, or intended, doing so; (Lth, M, IKtt;) 
but did it not, [or did it not immediately]. (Akh, 
S, K, &c.) 34 is applied to signify the being near to 
doing a thing whether it he [afterwards] done or 
not done. (S.) Without a negative, it enunciates 
the negation of the action; and coupled with a 
negative, it enunciates the happening of the 
action. (S, K.) [This will be explained in the 
course of the following observations.] It is (as Es- 
Suyootee says in the Itkan) an incomplete [i. e. a 
non-attributive] verb, of which only the pret. and 
aor. are used. It has a noun as the subject, in 
the nom. case; and an aor., [generally] without us 
as the predicate. (TA.) Sometimes they 
introduce u 1 after it, likening it to es-* 0 ; as, for 
ex., in the saying of Ru-heh, u 1 J.4 3 u* 34 3a 
1~~— -fy: [It had nearly come to nought from length 
of wear]. (S.) Used affirmatively, it is affirmative 
of the being near [to doing a thing, &c.]; and 
used negatively, it is negative thereof. It is a well- 
known opinion of many, that, used affirmatively, 
it is negative; and used negatively, it 
is affirmative: so that 4 j 34 means [Zeyd was 
near to doing; hut] he did not [or did not 
immediately]; as is shown by the expression [in 
the Kur xvii. 75, where u! is a contraction of [,u] 
ijjig j\j [And verily they were near to 
seducing thee]: and 3*4; 34 4 means [He was not 
near to doing; hut] he did; as is shown by the 
expression [in the Kur ii. 66,] uu^ 1 j34 4j [And 
they were not near to doing (it); but they 
afterwards did (it)]. I'Ab is related to have said, 
that wherever 34 and cilS) and 341 occur in the 
Kur-an, they denote a thing's never happening. 
Some say, that 34 [with a negative] denotes an 
action's happening with difficulty. Some, again, 
say, that the pret. preceded by a negative is 
affirmative [of the action &c.]; as is shown hy 
the expression uu^i 1 j34 4j [quoted above]: and 
that the aor. preceded by a negative is negative; 
as is shown hy the expression [in the Kur xxiv, 
40 ,] IaIjj 34j fl [He is not near to seeing it]; 
meaning that he sees not anything: [though this 
phrase is said to hear a different meaning, which 
see below]. But the correct opinion is the one 
first mentioned; that, used affirmatively, it is 
affirmative [of the being near to do a thing &c.]; 
and used negatively, it is negative [thereof]: so 
that 34 signifies He was near to doing; hut 
did not [or did not immediately]: and J*4 34 U 
He was not near to doing; much less did he do [or 
do immediately]; the denial of the action [or of 
the immediate performance of the action] being 
necessarily understood from the denial of the 
being near to do it. As to the expression in the 


Kur, uj^4! 1 j34 lij [quoted above], it enunciates 
the state of the people to whom it relates in the 
beginning of their case; for they were far 
from sacrificing the cow; and the affirmation of 
the action is understood only from the 
[preceding] expression 1* ji33a. And as to the 
expression [in the Kur xvii. 76,] j4jj 4 j :4 33] 
[Thou hadst certainly been near to inclining to 
them], the Prophet's not inclining to them 
little or much is understood from V jl [preceding], 
which requires this inference. (TA.) [Often, 
however, or (as some say) generally, with 
a negative preceding or following it, it is 
affirmative of the action's happening, but only 
after difficulty, or delay.] Aboo-Bekr says, 
that f jv u^ 34 4 means [Such a one hardly, or 
scarcely, or tardily, rose; like £ & fl, and Y 34 
fls iaj being understood; or] he rose after 
being slow, or tardy: (L:) and accord, to Az and 
others, 4 j 34 4 means [I hardly, or scarcely, or 
tardily, did; or] I did after being slow, or tardy: 
but sometimes it means I was not near to 
doing. (Msb, art. 44.) It is said, that 34 is 
sometimes a [mere redundant] connective (<4^0 
of the members of a sentence; (Kutr, Akh, AHat, 
K;) as in 41 jj 34: 4] [quoted above], meaning, He 
does not see it: (K:) or this means he is not near 
to seeing it: or, as some say, he sees it after his 
having been not near to seeing it by reason of the 
intenseness of the darkness: [or he hardly, or 
scarcely, or tardily, sees it:] and Fr says, with 
reference to the verse in which this phrase 
occurs, that it is allowable to say fji) 34 j p 
[meaning, He hardly, or scarcely, or tardily, rose] 
when one has risen after difficulty. (TA.) [Thus 
it appears, that, 34 U and J*4 -4: p 

sometimes signify He hardly, or scarcely, or 
tardily, did: and sometimes, he was not near to 
doing; he never did; he did not at all: so that it 
may be rendered he hardly or scarcely, or nowise 
or in nowise or never, did: or he could hardly 
do, or he could not at all, or could not nearly, or 

he could nowise or in nowise, do.] As asserts 

his having heard certain of the Arabs say, Y 
1 44 Y j 413 [I will not do that, nor will I he near to 
doing it]. (S.) 34 also signifies He desired; 

syn. 31 ji (Akh, S, K.) So in the verse 4:343 4:34 

U> - v ' .ilc y -U j| j -. adtij [she 

desired, and I desired; and that were the best of 
desire, if what hath passed, of the diverting 
delight of tender love, returned]. (Akh, S.) So, 

too, in the saying in the Kur [xx. 15,] fefkl 34 1 1 
desire (S, K) to conceal it: or, to manifest it: 
(Beyd:) for, like as it is allowable to put 4u' in the 
place of 34 1 ; a s in the saying in the Kur [xviii. 


76,] u 1 0^, so it is to use 341 [in the 
place of 4 jJ]: Akh says, that the words of the 
verse in question mean I will conceal it, 
and some say, that the meaning is I will 
manifest it: (TA:) hut most hold, that 341 should 
here be rendered in its original sense. (MF, TA.) 
Some of the Arabs make 34 to denote certainty; 
like ii4>, which primarily denotes doubt, and 

secondarily certainty. (L, art. 44.) 34) U i_i je 

[is in like manner explained] He hath become 
acquainted with that which is desired of him. (S, 

K.) You say to him who seeks of you a thing, 

when you do not desire to give him it, »34i Y j V

intelligence. See A. — And see 5 . R. Q. 1 44, 
[inf. n. of 4-A,] The being tender, affectionate, 

kind, or compassionate, to offspring. (S, K.) 

U AA, inf. n. as above, She (a ewe) was 

tender, or affectionate, to her young one, and 
licked it, when she brought it forth, (S, K,) 

making a sound like A A. (TA.) See 1 . 

Ac 44, inf. n. as above, He was kind, or 
compassionate, to him; i. e., to a man: he was 
kind, or affectionate, to him, and aided, 
or succoured, him. (TA.) — 4-A It was separated, 
dispersed, or scattered. (AA, T, K.) (The inf. 
n., AA is explained by (3 A: but I think it not 
improbable that this is a mistake for iAA; and 
that the meaning is, He was gentle, courteous, or 

kind.] A inf. n. of A “ he remained, &c. ” 

44 [At thy service! lit., Doubly at thy service!] 
(S, K, &c.) and A [At his service: &c.]. (TA.) [See 
an ex. voce 4-4 A- It is used in the present day 
like our phrase At thy service, and may well be 
thus rendered, or with the addition of time after 
time.] 44 is derived from A 1 [or rather from A 
as syn. with A 1 ] “ he remained &c. and means I 
wait intent upon thy service, or upon obedience 
to thee: (Fr, S, K;) waiting [at they service] 
after waiting; [i. e., time after time;] and 
answering [thy commands] after answering: (K:) 
it [i. e. the noun without the annexed pron.] is 
put in the acc. case as an inf. n. [used as an 
absolute complement of its own verb which is 
understood], as in I jA j <11 tiia.; and the right way 
would be to say A 41; but it is put in the dual 
number for the sake of corroboration; 
meaning 44 -A A 441), and A Ala], [waiting 
at thy service, or in attendance upon thee, or in 
thy presence, after waiting, or time after time]. 
(Fr, S.) [See also the similar expression 4^4] 
Or A signifies the obeying, or serving; 
or obedience, or service; from the original 
signification of the “ remaining, staying, abiding, 
or dwelling,” [in a place]: the dual, in the nom. 
case, is u4; and in the acc. and gen., C A; and the 
original meaning of 44 is I have obeyed thee, or 
served thee, twice: [or I do obey thee, &c.:] the J 
[of uA] being elided because of its being prefixed 
to the pron. (IAar.) Or 44 is from the saying A 
l s J- 4 uA “ the house of such a one faces my 
house ”; (Kh, S, K;) and the meaning is I present 
myself before thee, (or repair to thee, K,) 
doing what thou likest, answering thee [after 
answering, or time after time]: the lS is to form 
the dual number; and indicates that the noun is 
in the acc. case as an inf. n. [used as mentioned 
above]. (Kh, S.) Or it means My love [is given] to 
thee; from the expression A «' A! “ a 


woman loving (and affectionate, TA,) to her 
husband ”: so in the K: but the expression, as 
related on the authority of Kh, is A A which 
is confirmed by a verse that he cites. (TA.) Or the 
meaning is ,^44' [My sincere service, or the 
like, (is given) to thee;] from the expression 4~*^ 
4-4 “ pure nobility, or the like. ” (K.) Accord, to 
Yoo, 441 is a noun in the sing, number with the 
pron. annexed to it: this noun is originally 44 , of 
the measure A4 (not of the measure 34 
because this is rare in the language:) the the 
last m is changed into lS to avoid the 
reduplication; and thus it becomes A: then 
the lS, being movent, and immediately preceded 
by fet-hah, is changed into I; and it becomes 41 
[or A, for the lS in this case is called I]: then, 
being conjoined with ^ in 44, and with » in A, 
its ' is changed into lS ; after the same manner as 
you say 44! and 44 and 44. (TA.) [But see what 

here follows.] 44 A is a phrase exactly 

similar to 44, meaning At the service (or, lit. 
doubly at the service) of thy hands! and this is 
said, in the S, art. A to be at variance with the 
opinion of Yoo, given above; for, if A were 
similar to A! &c., being prefixed to a noun, not a 
pron., it would be 44 A, not A-] Accord, to El- 
Khatta- bee, 4-^ A signifies May thy hands be 
safe and sound! the desinential syntax being 
disregarded in the saying 4 a which rightly 
should be -A'4, in order that may match in 
sound with 44: but Z says, that the meaning is, I 
will obey thee, and be at thy free disposal, as 
a thing which thou shalt dispose of with thy 
hands in whatever manner thou shalt please. 

(TA.) In like manner you say 44 A [At 

the service (or doubly at the service) of Zeyd]. 

(Msb.) See art. A. A, with kesreh for its 

termination, like i_A and (A, is also related as 
having been used: (Sb:) [and it is still used in 
some parts, as signifying At thy service!]. — A

staying. (K.) — — A camel-driver who keeps

afterwards contracted into 33311; (Fr, K:) which is 
the common reading: (Fr:) A certain idol; thus 
called by the appellation of a man who used to 
moisten with clarified butter at the place 
thereof: (K:) the man who did this was thus 
called, and afterwards the idol itself. (TA.) Some 
of the lexicologists say, that it was a mass of 
rock, at the place whereof was a man who used to 
moisten for the pilgrims, and which, when 
he died, was worshipped: (L:) but ISd says, 
I know not what is the truth in this case. (TA.) In 
the R it is said, that the man who used to do this 
was 'Amr Ibn-Lu-ei; that when the tribe 
of Khuza'ah obtained the dominion over Mekkeh, 
and banished the tribe of Jurhum, the Arabs 
made him a Lord, or an object of worship; and 
that he was El-Latt, who used to moisten for 
the pilgrims upon a well-known rock, 
called 33311 Sji— =>: or, it is said, that the man in 
question was of the tribe of Thakeef; and that 
when he died, 'Amr Ibn-Lohei G^3: so in the TA) 
said to the people, “He hath not died, but hath 
entered the rock: ” and ordered them to worship 
it, and built over it a house called 33331: it is also 
said to have continued thus during the life of this 
man and that of his son, for three hundred years: 
then that rock was named 33311, without teshdeed 
to the 4 j, and was taken for an idol, to 
be worshipped. (TA.) It is disputed whether it 
were [an idol] of the tribe of Thakeef at Et-Taif, 
or of the tribe of Kureysh at En-Nakhleh. 
(MF.) Some say, that the 4 j is originally without 
teshdeed, and to denote the fem. gender: Ks used 
to pronounce the word in a case of pause »5UI; 
and Aboo-Is-hak [Zj] says, that this is agreeable 
with analogy; but that the more approved mode 
is to pronounce it in such case with AM says, 
that the manner in which Ks pronounced it in a 


case of pause shows that he did not derive it 
from 43 . The polytheists who worshipped this 
idol used to compare its name with the name 
of <111. It is also said, that 33331, without teshdeed, 
is of the measure <3*s [originally <jj4l] from 
the root l S jl; [and that the said idol was so called]

epithet] applied to a she-camel during the

camel from the time when the hump of her young 
one becomes fat, until the expiration of seven 
months, when she weans her young one, and this 
she does at the [auroral] rising of Canopus: (TA:)

jalyl (s, K, &c.,) (tropical:) Pregnant 

winds; so called because they bear the water and 
the clouds, and turn the latter over and about, 
and then cause them to send down rain; (TA;) or 
because they become pregnant, and then 
impregnate the clouds: (IJ:) the sing, is jjsV 6 u, 
the contr. of which is termed f=4= [or “ a 
barren wind ”]: (ISd:) or jju signifies ciila 
[possessing that which impregnates]; like as f* j-? 
i!i signifies ujj j4; plj j4 ,3=0 33j : (AHeyth:) 
or 4 signifies impregnating, or 

fecundating, winds; (S, K;) as also 1 [pi. 

of 3=43] : (K:) or it is not allowable to say ;3p4; 
(S;) but this is the regular form of the word; 
because the wind impregnates the clouds; (IJ;) 
and thus 4 is extr.: or, as some say, the proper 
original word is 3=43; but the winds do not 
impregnate unless they are themselves pregnant; 
as though they were pregnant with good, and, 
when they raised the clouds, transmitted to them 

that good. (S.) 4= (K) (tropical:) War

of a she-camel: (A 'Obeyd, T, S, K, &c.:) or what is 
in the back of the stallion camel; [meaning his 
progeny in the elemental state;] (Aboo-Sa'eed, 
K;) but the former, says Az, is the 
correct signification: (L:) 3=. jil 3 is for ^ c

like from 4s and 044-3 from =>•: (S:)

Mohammad desired his followers to use this 
expression instead of 344 4 L 2 , which he disliked. 
(K, TA.) — — With =0=4 O! following it, His 
soul strove with him to incline him to the thing, 
(K,) and became greedy for it. (TA.) [But Az 
seems to disapprove of this explanation.] 34, as

he took it from a place where it was not thought 
to be; this being the primary signification: and 
hence, he took it. (Msb.) It is said of a man: and 
you say also, 4=211 jiUJI 44 [The bird picked up 
from the ground the grains]. (Msb.) The Arabs 
say to a calumniator, j ^421 1 4=41) 4= 44c= j\

(TA.) And it is said in a proverb, 34=4 =441 4-4 

[Is it by the hunting of the hedgehog or the 
picking up thereof from the ground?] applied to 
a poor man who becomes rich suddenly. (TA.) [In 
Freytag's Arab. Prov. (i. 726 ,) 3441 =44l 4-4 :

chooses to take it: (TA:) and the same, what is

up thence,] after the cutting off of the dates: 
(TA:) IAth says, that j with damm to the J 
and fet-h to the 3, is often mentioned in trads., 
and signifies property which is found: (TA:) Az 
says, that <Lal, with fet-h to the 3, signifies a 
thing which one finds dropped, or thrown down, 
and takes; (Mgh, Msb;) and that all the 
lexicologists and skilful grammarians say so; 
(Msb;) and in like manner, A 'Obeyd, on 
the authority of As and of El-Ahmar; (TA;) only 
Lth, of all whom he has heard, saying that it is 
i ^-LSl, with sukoon; (Mgh, Msb;) and Fr: (TA:) IF 
and ElFarabee and others mention only j. ^Lal; 
and some reckon the pronunciation with sukoon 
as an error of the vulgar; and the reason is this; 
that the original word is j which, in 

consequence of its being in frequent use, as 
applied to what is picked up in plundering, 
is contracted, sometimes, by the elision of the », 
into i -Llal, and sometimes, by the elision of the I 
into i ^1=2; and if they made the 3 quiescent, 
there would be two alterations in the word, and 
such double alteration does not exist in chaste 
language: (Msb:) IB, however, says that i <Lal is 
correct; and he approves it; because ^ has the 
sense of a pass. part, n., as in the instance 
of and ^ has the sense of an act. part, n., 
as in the instance of and that it occurs 

in poetry: and IAth observes, that some say thus; 
but that i ^La! is more common and more 
correct. (TA.) Anything that is scattered, of ears 
of corn, or of fruit; n. un. with »: (TA:) what is

ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss, (AHn, 
K,) and which men pick up. (AHn.) What is

found in a mine; (K;) or such are termed g-La> -Laf 
(S:) or -Lai signifies pieces of gold, or of silver, like 
what are termed and larger, in mines; which 
are the best thereof: and one says -Lai m 4 -: (Lth:) 
and i -Laii, also, signifies gold found in a mine. 
(TA.) You say also, 3“ -Lai I In this 
place is some small quantity of pasturage. (S.) 
And JLJ1 -Lai ^ jVI in the land is pasturage not 

much in quantity for the beasts. (TA.) The pi. 
is -Lilli. (TA.) <Lal : see -Hi, throughout the first 

sentence. Accord, to Lth, it [also] signifies A 

man who repeatedly and perseveringly seeks 
after things to be picked up, and picks them up: 
(TA:) and some say, that ; ^-Lal signifies one who 
picks up: but the more common and correct 


signification of this latter is “ property which is 
found,” as before stated. (IAth.) <Lal ; 
see -Hi, throughout the first sentence: — and 
see <Lal. -Lli! : see -Hi, in the latter part of the 
paragraph. -Llil: see -Hi, in three places. -Llil: see 3 .

which the reaping-hooks miss;] the act denoted 
in the explanation of -Llil. (JK, K, TA.) You say, > 
-Lilli Jz. .Llilll^ [He constrains himself to 

obtain the means of life, or he obtains what is 
barely sufficient for his sustenance, by picking 
up, or gleaning, from the ears of corn which

given without any syll. signs.) [If the reading 
intended be -Llilll cj 2 -Lliiii, the meaning of -Llil is 
The act of missing ears of corn with the 
reapinghook; as is implied in the K, where -Lli! is 
imperfectly explained: but this I 

think improbable.] -Llil and -Llil are [respectively] 
like i— [as signifying what is “ reaped ”] 

and [as signifying the act of “ reaping

that is picked up, taken up, raised, (Mgh,) or

(Msb.) And, generally, (Mgh,) A foundling; 

or child that is cast out, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and 
found by a man, (Az, TA,) or picked up; (S;) or 
because it is cast out with the object of its being 
picked up: (Mgh:) not what Lth asserts it to be; i. 
e. a child that is cast out in the roads, and 
there found, whose father and mother are 
unknown: of the measure in the sense of the

unawares, (Lth, K,) without seeking it. 
(Lth.) see -Lil, first sentence, in four 

places. ^-LLl applied to a man, and to a woman,

TA;) as also . i-LaV applied to a man; (TA;) and so

picks up things from the ground; and the second, 
who does so much, or often; and the third, who 
does so very much, or very often: or] who takes 
things from places where they were not thought 
to be: (Msb:) and all signify a man who picks up 
the ears of corn [that fall] when the crop is 
reaped, and [the fruit that falls] when the 
ripe dates are cut from the raceme: (TA:) and the 
first and second, a bird that picks up grains.

will take it up: (Msb in art. -Lw) or for every

and publish it: (S, * K:) a proverb, (TA,) relating

to give intensiveness to the meaning, (Msb, in 
art. -Li-a,) or for the purpose of assimilation: (Msb 
in that art., and in the present one:) if you say 
jjl-L=, or the like, you say -LaV. (Msb in the present

(K,) without seeing it, (M, K,) or spreading it out 
and turning it over and examining it: (Mgh:) or 
on the condition that the feeling it with the hand 
shall cut one off from the choice of returning it: 
(TA:) the mode of bargaining thus termed is 
forbidden. (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb.) — — For a 
tropical signification of the verb, see 1. 4

(Msb, &c.) One says, of a woman who 
commits adultery, or fornication, or acts 
viciously, V (A, TA,) or V 

(K,) but the latter is at variance with the 
written authorities, the former being the phrase 
commonly known, (TA,) [properly signifying, 
Such a woman does not repel the hand of a 
feeler;] meaning, (tropical:) such a woman 
commits adultery, or fornication, and 
acts viciously, (K, TA,) not repelling from herself 
any one who desires of her that he may lie with 
her; (TA;) and she is suspected of easiness, 
or compliance, (K, TA,) towards him who desires 
of her that he may lie with her: (TA:) or the 
meaning is, such a woman gives, of her 
husband's property, what is sought, or 
demanded, from her; and this is more probably 
meant in a trad, in which a man is related to have 
said thus of his wife; because Mohammad 
directed him to retain her, and did not require 
him to divorce her. (TA.) The like said of a man,

latter signify he took with his tongue what 
remained in the mouth after eating: (M:) or 
he sought leisurely and gradually after the taste, 
and tasted time after time: (M, K:) or 1 the latter 
signifies he tasted time after time; as also ls5=*j:

added, as in ciiiii [fo the CK, (El-Muarrij, S, 

K,) and cLj. (El-Muarrij, S.) With respect to 

the proper meaning and etymology of LjY there 
are four opinions. First, that it is a single word, a 
verb in the pret. tense: and some say, that it is 
originally LjY in the sense of and afterwards 
used as a negative, like 3: so says Aboo-Dharr 
El-Khushanee, in his Expos, of the Book of Sb: 
others, that it is originally i_v 4 ; that its i_>“ is 
changed into Lj, and then the ls into I, because it 



2685 Digitized Text Version VI. 1 


J 


[BOOKI.] 


is movent and preceded by fet-hah: so says Abu- 
r-Rabeea. Second, that it is two words, the 
negative Y, with the fem. cj, added to make the 
word fem., as say IHsh and Er-Radee, or to 
render the negation more intensive, as is said in 
the Expos, of the Katr by the author of the latter 
work: and this is the general opinion. Third, that 
it is an independent word, not originally i _>“4 
nor Y; as related by the sheykh Aboo-Is- hak Esh- 
Shatibee alone. Fourth, that it is a word and a 
part of a word, namely the negative Y, and cii 
prefixed to 0 #="-; which opinion is ascribed to 
A'Obeyd [as is mentioned in the S] and Ibn-El- 
Taraweh: the former of whom argues in favour of 
this opinion from the fact that cii is found so 
prefixed in Othman's copy of the Kur-an; but this 
is no proof, because there are found in the 
writing of that copy things at variance with 
analogy. (TA.) [however] occurs, 

without cjV, in the following verse of Aboo- 
Wejzeh: 0-r 0'-* j ilalc (j* U jjilaUJI 

[The persons who act affectionately in the 
time when there is none (other) that 
acts affectionately; and the feeders in the time 
when (it is said) Where is the feeder?] (S.) The 
general opinion is favoured by the 
following facts: that *^Y is pronounced in a case 
of pause ^jY and »Y: that it is written separately 
from Cx*-: and that it is sometimes written pY, 
with kesreh to the cj, as is mentioned by Z, 
agreeably with the fundamental rule with respect 
to the concurrence of two quiescent letters 
[when followed by a conjunctive I]; whereas, were 
it a verb in the pret. tense, there would be no 
reason for its being written with kesreh: it is also 
written ^jY, with dammeh to the and both 
these variations occur in readings of the Kur-an: 
but with fet-hah to the cj is the 

most common. (TA.) — — With respect to its 
government there are also four opinions. First, 
that it has no government: that if a noun in 
the nom. case follow it, it is put in that case as an 
inchoative of which [as is mentioned in the S] the 
enunciative is suppressed; and that if a noun in 
the acc. case follow it, it is put in that case as an 
objective complement of a verb suppressed; 
which is the opinion of Akh; the meaning of ^Y 
jj*. being, in the former case, 0 #?-Y 

[A place of flight not existing for them; 
which does not imply that there was none for 
others; as Y here has the force of a particular, not 
a general, negation]; and in the latter case, the 
meaning being, 0#=“- is 'J' Y [I see not a time 
of flight]. Second, that it governs in the 
same manner as u[; which is another opinion of 


Akh and the Koofees. Third, that it is a particle 
governing the gen. case; an opinion ascribed to 
Fr by Er-Radee and IHsh and others. Fourth, that 
it governs like 64k and this is the general 
opinion; but IHsh restricts it by two 
conditions; that the two nouns which it governs 
must be significant of time, and that one of them 
must be suppressed. (TA.) [It is generally the 
subject, rarely the predicate, that is suppressed.] 

'-tiV [when it has grammatical government] 

does not occur without [or, as many 

say, some word syn. therewith, as ■— ■Sj, &c.]. (S, 
K.) So says Akh, accord, to J; but this is the 
assertion of Sb; because the latter holds it to 
have the same government as o-yl; whereas Akh 
assigns to it no government [as explained above]. 
(IB.) But [it is said that] 0*="- is 

sometimes suppressed, (in poetry, S, [or in 
prose,]) though meant to be understood; as in the 
following saying of Mazin Ibn-Malik, 
[respecting 'Abd-Shems, surnamed Makrooa, the 
son of Saad the son of Zeyd-Menah the son of 
Temeem, and respecting Heyjumaneh the 
daughter of El-'Ambar the son of 'Amr the son of 
Temeem, (S, art. £ js,) w ho was enamoured 
of Makrooa,] -41 eji* cjVj [And 

she conceived a longing desire; but it was not a 
time for her conceiving such a desire. And 
how (O Heyjumaneh) should Makrooa be thine? 
See Freytag, Arab. Prov. i. 343 and ii. 525 .] (S, K.) 
This, however, is said to be not poetry but 
a prose-example. (TA.) Moreover, it is observed, 
that ^Y, in this instance, has no government, and 
that a word signifying time is not meant to be 
understood after it: [so that the meaning is, And 
she conceived a longing desire, but it was as 
though she did not conceive such a desire:] (MF.) 
for when has government, the subject 
and predicate cannot both be suppressed. (AHei, 
MF.) 4 4^11 see 1 . 4jjl a word denoting a wish 
[signifying Would that — ; I wish that — ;] (S, 
K;) generally relating to a thing that is 
impossible; rarely to a thing that is possible: 
(IHsh, K:) governing the subject in the acc. case, 
and the predicate in the nom. case, (S, K,) like 
(or [rather] u], MF) and its coordinates, because 
it resembles verbs in their force as words, [being 
composed of at least three letters, and the last 
being meftoohah,] and in their admitting most of 
the pronouns as affixes, and in their meanings. 
(S.) Ex. 4 j*Ij Cul [Would that Zeyd were 
going;] (S;) and 1 45) ciiks [Would that I 
had done so and so.] (TA.) You say ^ as well 
as (S, K,) like and ,^4*1, anc j and ^j: 
(S:) but uHjJ is more common than (jjJ; 


whereas is less common than J*l. (TA.) You 
also say U O, would that — ;.] As to the saying 
of the poet, 1*^1 j j ULJI dul U meaning j j IjI, 

[O, would that the days of youth were returning 
(to us)!] jj is put in the acc. case therein as a 
word descriptive of state: (S:) or it is governed in 
the acc. case by a verb understood, as 
or cAle, or some other verb suitable to the 
meaning: so says Sb: (TA:) or cinl in the above 
verse may be used in the manner of ^44. j, [see 
below], (S,) for ciJ is sometimes used in the 
manner of [I found], (Fr, S, K,) 

in government, not in meaning, (MF,) as related 
by the grammarians on the authority of certain of 
the Arabs, so that it is doubly transitive, and used 
in the manner of verbs: (S:) you say, 4ul 
U-aiU [Would that Zeyd were going away, &c.]: 
(S, K:) this is done to give intensiveness: one 
says, for this purpose, 445 44 j 4jjl (Would that 
Zeyd were standing) putting both the subject and 

the predicate in the acc. case. (Msb.) 144! :

having no other tense, (Sb, S, M, Msb, Mughnee,) 
nor a part. n. nor an inf. n.; (Sb, M, Msb; *) of the 
measure (Mughnee;) originally from 
which it is contracted by the suppression of 
a vowel, (Sb, * S, M, * K, Mughnee, *) being 
found difficult of pronunciation, (S,) [i. e.,] to 
render it easy to pronounce, (K,) like jle for jlfo 
(Sb, M,) the lS not being changed into I (Sb, S, M) 
because it is imperfectly inflected, being used in 
the pret. form for the present, (S,) [i. e.,] because 
it has no future, nor part, n., nor inf. n., nor 
derivation, wherefore, not being perfectly 
inflected like its coordinates, it is made like that 
which is not a verb, as 44; (Sb, M:) what shows it 
to be a verb, (S, Mughnee,) not a particle 
occupying the place of 4, as Ibn-Es-Sarraj and 
some others after him have asserted, (Mughnee,) 
though not perfectly inflected like [other] verbs, 


(S,) is their saying ■— 44 and 4i41 (S, Mughnee) 
and fid (S) and 1*41 and Ij44 and 444 [&c.], 
(Mughnee,) like as they say 4 jj 4 a and 
and fijd= [&c.]: (S:) we have not determined its 
measure to be J*i, because this is not contracted; 
nor J«i, because there is no verb of this 
measure with lS for its medial radical letter, 
except if*; but 441 has been heard; so, accord, to 
this form, it may be like J4*: (Mughnee:) 
the Benoo-Dabbeh say 441 and 1*4 in the sense 
of 441 and lid; and some of them say 4 i 4 : (TA, 
art. i_>“jf) but Sb says, that the Arabs did not 
say 441, like as they said 414, because is not 
perfectly inflected like [other] verbs. (M.) [There 
is also another opinion respecting its origin, 
which will be mentioned in the course of this 
article.] It [is generally a particular (not a 
universal) negative, and] denotes the negation of 
a thing at the present time; (M, Mughnee;) [i. e.] 
it denotes [thus] the negation of its predicate: 
(Msb:) and has the same government as the 
verbid and its coordinates; (S;) governing 
the subject in the norm, and the predicate in the 
accus.: (S, Mughnee:) as when you say, 4 j i_>*4 
143a [Zeyd is not a person standing]: (Msb:) 
and by means of the context, it denotes the 
negation of a thing at a time not the present; as in 
the saying of El-Aasha [respecting 
Mohammad], ? jdl ilLc. (j*4j 1*11 jj 4** U 44 iU <1 
'4 <334 [He has bounties the bestowing of which 
is not on alternate days; and the giving of to- 
day will not be a preventer of it to-morrow]; and 
[sometimes when it is followed by a verb, as] in 
the saying, <13* <111 jll ^ [God has not created 
the like of him, or it.] (Mughnee.) But it differs 
from its coordinates in that the prep, *4 may be 
prefixed to its predicate: as in the saying, 4 j u4! 

[Zeyd is not going away]; the m being a 
means of the verb's being trans., and also 
corroborative of the negation: and one may 
optionally not introduce it, because one may do 
without the corroborative, and because some 
verbs are trans. sometimes by means of a prep, 
and sometimes without a prep., as 41414 
and dlflj -dill, (s.) It also differs from its 
coordinates in that its predicate may not be 
put before it: for you may say 4 j 1)4 but 
not 4j d)41 iuA l : (S:) or some allow this latter; 
but others disallow it. (Ibn- 'Akeel on 
the Alfeeyeh, section on and its coordinates.) 
It is also used as an exceptive particle, (S, M, 
Mughnee,) in the place of YJ; (S, Mughnee;) in 
which case [also] its subject [which is 
understood] is in the nom. case, and its predicate 
in the accus.: (S:) you say, I4j u41 f j“l ^*14 [The 
company of men came to me, except Zeyd]; as 
though you said, I4j i_>* 4. (S, M: but in the 


latter, instead of we find and instead 
of ^1*3, we find ^Yl.) You may also say, cs-44- 
“4141 f j4l [The company of men came to me, 
excepting thee]; but the separate pronoun, 4H4, is 
here better. (S.) When the predicate after it 
is connected with YJ, as in the ex. here next 
following, Benoo-Temeem make it in the nom. 
case: thus they say, 414*11 Yl m 4=JI u41 [It is 
not perfume, except musk; meaning, nothing is 
perfume except musk]: which has been resolved 
is several ways; some holding s-44 1 to be the 
subject of u*4: but its being peculiar to the dial, of 
Temeem refutes the explanations here referred 
to: some, again, hold *>yl to be here used as a 
particle; and so in the saying <4* <111 J14 (j*4, 
mentioned above. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it is 
used in the sense of <1 j4ll Y [the Y which denies 
in a general manner to the uttermost, i. e., 
universally, or totally]; as is said in the K, except 
that in all the copies thereof we find l"J j put by 
mistake for 4jjj: (TA:) [so in the saying in the 
Kur, ii. 194 , j34e ,j*4, which is the same as Y 
fo verse 235 of the same chapter, 
meaning, There shall be no crime, or 
sin, chargeable upon you]. Sometimes, also, it is 
used as a connective particle, (Mughnee,) in the 
sense of Y so used: (TA:) as in the saying [of a 
poet], Anil'll ^4 M jiiill * j4YI j 444 II <1YIj jiall a) 
[Where is the place of flight when God is the 
pursuer, and El-Ashram (meaning Abrahah) is 
the overcome, not the overcomer?]: which has 
been resolved by supposing ^4411 to be the 
subject of o“4, and the predicate to 
be suppressed; the latter being said by Ibn-Malik 
to be an annexed pronoun referring to El- 
Ashram; so that the meaning is 441411 <*41 
[the overcomer is not he]. (Mughnee.) It is said 
(M, K) by Fr, (M,) and also by Kh, (TA,) that the 
original of is o4i Y; (M, K [in the latter 
of which I read <441 jl, as in several copies of the 
K, or rather tji4l jl, as corrected in the TA, 
instead of *44* jl, the reading in the CK];) and 
this, says Fr, is shown by the saying, u*4 4 ir?- 

c>41j, i. e., [Bring thou him, or it,] from where he, 
or it, is, and is not: (M:) or u44j u4i 44 a* ^44 i. 
e., [Come thou to me, or probably, the 
right reading is <j ^^44 bring thou to me him, or it, 
(as I find in a copy of the K, in which <; has been 
added in red ink, and in the A I find <j h 4 ,)] from 
where he, or it, is, and he, or it, is not: (K:) or 
the meaning is, 4j Y 44 ^ [from where there

or no power, or ability]: (K, * TA:)

time and one signifying a time not past: and 
accord, to some of them, governs in the nom. 
case a noun signifying a past time and one 
signifying a time not past: (M, L:) but the general 
and most approved way is to make govern in 
the gen. case a noun signifying a time not past, 
and in the nom. case one signifying a time past; 
and to make govern in the gen. case a 
noun signifying a time not past and one 
signifying a time past: (T, M, L:) most of the 
Arabs hold, that each must govern in the gen. 
case a noun signifying the present time; and that 
it is preferable to make ^ govern in the same 
case, and to make ^ govern in the nom. case, a 
noun signifying a past time: (Mughnee:) [they 
therefore say, <441 and <441 and p 

and ipy iii; but they say, fj i 4> 
lW?^I and iP'jt 4>.] Some [or, rather, most] 
say, u'-ij) ijl ^ and CPjt ^ » jl fl, [I have not

[in these instances] to govern the nom. case; 
and the gen. case. (L.) Such is said when the 
period of separation is a day and part of a 
day. (Msb, art. j«A) The Benoo-Dabbeh and Er- 


l' 

Rabab make to govern the gen. case in every 
instance. (M, L.) The phrases, P <40 U 
Jjl, and Jjl p (S, K, art. Jl j; and L,) and 4> 
Jj^l p t and Jjl file- [I have not seen him 
since last year,] are also mentioned by different 
authors. (L.) The Arabs generally agree in 
pronouncing 4* with damm to the - when it is 
followed by a movent or a quiescent letter; (T, M, 
L;) as in p, 4i »j' 4> and e04 (T, L:) and 

to pronounce with the j quiescent when it is 
followed by a movent letter, (T, M, L,) and with 
damm and [sometimes] with kesr when it 
is followed by a conjunctive I; (M, L;) as in “j 1 4 
(Pji i*, and VJ 4, [and 4*]: (T, L:) and 
so say most of the grammarians. (T.) Lh says, The 
Benoo-’Obeyd, of the tribe of Ghanee, make the j 
of 4> movent when it is followed by a movent or a 
quiescent letter, and make the noun following it 
to be in the nom. case, saying P and some of 
them pronounce it with kesr when followed by a 
quiescent letter, saying 444 p but this is not the 
proper way. (M, L.) In the phrase tP ^ <40 
the Arabs make the j movent because of the 
occurrence [otherwise] of two quiescent letters 
together; and they [generally] give it not kesr, but 
damm, because the latter is the final vowel of 
its original (M, L.) One says also, <44 ^ 
e44, and ,»44 <4 which fet-h to the j in each. (K.) 
The Benoo-Suleym are related to have used the 
expression ii* <40 ^ [by uu meaning six 
nights], with kesr to the f of p and with the 
noun following it in the nom. case: and the tribe 
of ’Okl are related to have used the expression 4“ 
Cp'y, with the u elided, and with kesr to the f, 

and damm to the j. (M, L.) Each of the two 

words and is also followed by a 
verbal proposition, as in the instance it Jl j U 
’O0] [He has not ceased, since his two 

hands tied his wrapper of the lower part of 
the body]: or a nominal proposition, as in the 
instance 0 Jl-dl (j*jl Pj V j [And I ceased 
not to seek wealth from the time of my being 
a youth, or young man]: in such cases, each is an 
adv. n. prefixed to the proposition [and 
governing it virtually in the gen. case], or to a 
noun significant of time [understood as] prefixed 
thereto [in the same manner]: or, as some say, 

each is an inchoative. (K.) The original of 

is because they restore the dammeh to the j in 
the case of the occurrence of two quiescent letters 
together; as in the instance of <04 x>, for were not 
its original with damm, they would give it kesr: 
[but this some do, as has been shown above:] and 
because its dim. is 44«: (K:) for when is used as 
a proper name of a man, its dim. is thus formed, 
by restoring the u, that it may be of 
the measure 3i*4 (IJ, M, L:) or when is a noun, 


it is originally p and when it is a particle, it is 

itself original. (K.) Accord, to some, ^ (T, 

S, L, K) and (K) are originally o? and it, which 
are made one word, (T, S, L, K,) by eliding the 
hemzeh, and then giving damm to the i because

truth of this opinion: (S, L:) or, as some say, 
and are originally the prep. i> and ji in the 
sense of (L, K) in the dial, of Teiyi: so says 
Fr.; adding, that when either governs a gen. case, 
it is used in the manner of p; and when it

using the expression > ls^I P [,lPji ji ^ 
Cpp and that the former government prevails in 
the case of because the u is not suppressed:

noun of indication I j; so that in the phrase <40 U

him who [is dying, but] has life in him. (TA.) Fr

verily they will die. (Msh.) MF observes, that kk

that there can be no difference in their meanings: 
that the making a difference between them is 
contrary to analogy; agreeably with which, they 
should be like dik and 33, and 33 and uik and 
also contrary to what has been heard from the 
Arabs; for they made no difference in their use of 
these two words. (TA.) [See also what is said
