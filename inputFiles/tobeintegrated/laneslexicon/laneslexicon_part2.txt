PUBLISHER’S NOTE 


Edward William Lane’s ARABIC - ENGLISH LEXICON Book I 
contains all the classical words, their derivatives, and there 
usages. It appears in eight separate volumes and took the 
author more than thirty years to compile. 

Book II, which Dr. Lane contemplated and which was to 
contain rare words and explanations, was incomplete at the 
time of his death in 1876 and therefore never appeared. 

In describing Lane’s Lexicon, Dr. G. P. Badger wrote, “This 
marvelous work in its fullness and richness, its deep research, 
correctness and simplicity of arrangement far transcends the 
Lexicon of any language ever presented to the world.”

[BOOK I.] 

Digitized Text Version Vl.l 




The fifth letter of the alphabet: called f*=s which 
is one of the names of letters of the fem. gender, 
hut which it is allowable to make masc.: it is one 
of the letters termed [or vocal, i. e. 

pronounced with the voice, and not with the 
breath only]: and of the number of the letters 
termed and —4 >4 because it cannot 

be uttered in a case of pause without a strong 
compression, and a strong sound: and it is also 
one of those termed from which is 

the place of opening of the mouth. (TA.) It 

is sometimes substituted for lS, when the latter 
letter is doubled, (K,) or is so substituted by some 
of the Arabs; (AA, S;) as in for (s-4aa; (AA, S, 
K;) and £>», for ijj*. (AA, S.) An Arab of the 
desert recited to Khalaf El-Ahmar, 44' 

j cjjje. [My maternal uncle is 

’Oweyf, and Aboo-'Alijj, who feed with flesh-meat 
at nightfall]; meaning [£■ and (S.) It is also 
sometimes substituted for a single l S. (S, K.) AZ 
gives the following ex.: cAj a c±£, j\ C jj U 

ki l i'jj [O my Lord, if Thou accept my 

plea, a brayer (or mule) shall not cease to bring 
me to Thee (i. e. to thy temple)]; (S;) 
meaning ^44-^ (K) [and .[^ and are 

also mentioned as occurring in a verse, for 
and [because originally iji^ i and (s-44]. (S.) 
But all these substitutions are abominable, (S, 
Ibn-'Osfoor,) and only allowable in cases of 
poetical necessity. (Ibn- 'Osfoor.) It is further 
said that some of the Arabs, among whom were 
the tribe of Kuda'ah, changed lS, when occurring 
immediately after £, into r; and said, for p'j, 
[originally ge-lj [,^=- 0 : this is what is 

termed Fr attributes the substitution of jr 

for lS to the tribe of Teiyi, and some of the tribe 
of Asad. (TA.) — — Some of the Arabs also 
changed it into ls; saying for and 
for cuUJA., and for (AZ, S in 

art. o-^.) — [As a numeral, jr denotes Three; and, 
as such, is generally written without the dot, but 
thus ° r thus c, to distinguish it from £, 
which denotes eight.] L> The breast (jA-=>, Zj

being, (TA,) and of a bird, and (tropical:) of

mentioned this addition of wealth, or property. 
(TA. [See, however, 4J-4, below.]) The rajiz (Ru- 
beh Ibn-El-'Ajjaj, TA) says, uM-j 
[And God is mindful of my work and my 
earning]. (S, TA.) — Also He sold i. e. »j*i

explanation: (AAF, TA:) and this signification is 
tropical; (IDrst, MF, TA;) the poor man 
being likened to one who has a broken bone, and 
his restoration to wealth, or competence, being 
likened to the setting of the bone; wherefore he 
is called 3 , as though the vertebrae of his back

contr. of 3: (S, Msb, K:) it is the assertion that 
God compels his servants, or mankind, to

(Lth, TA,) do not: and when you say, j. 34 Y 
34', [or 34,] the meaning is, I adjure thee by 
thy fortune, or good fortune, do not: (Lth, K:) 
Aboo- 'Alee Esh-Shalowbeenee asserts that 
it implies the signification of an oath. (MF.) In 
the phrase 34 Y 34', AAF says, we may 
consider 34i Y as put in the place of a denotative 
of state; or the phrase may be originally Y j\ 34' 
34, j\ being suppressed, and its government 
annulled: [therefore it may be rendered, in the 
former case, Is it with seriousness on thy part, 
thou doing such a thing? and in the latter case. Is 
it with seriousness on thy part that thou will not 
do such a thing? i. e. dost thou mean seriously 
that thou will not do it? or in this case, 34' may 
be used as a form of adjuration in one of the 
senses explained above, and 34 Y may 
mean, that thou do not such a thing; or 34' may 
mean 343, (explained above, and so in the three 
exs. below,) and 34 Y, thou wilt not do it:] 
and, as AHei says, there is here a nice point, 
which is this; that the noun [meaning the 
pronoun] to which 4 is prefixed should agree in 
person with the verb which follows it; so that one 
should say, 3ij£i Y cs4, and 34 Y 34', and »4' 
L jj ji Y; because 4 is an inf. n. corroborating the 
proposition that follows it. (MF.) — — Aso,

again, 4,)] A striving, labour, or toil; exertion of

(Msb.) Beverage of the kind called fa made 
in such a vessel is forbidden in a trad.: (Mgh, 
TA:) but accord, to IAth, the trad, means a vessel 
of this kind glazed within, because the beverage 
acquires strength, and ferments, more quickly in 
a glazed earthen vessel. (TA.) — See also ‘ fa: — 
and see what here next follows, ‘fa (S, K) and 
J, ‘fa (K) A small piece of wood, (K,) or a piece of 
wood about a cubit long, (S,) having a snare at

with which gazelles are caught: (S, K:) when the 
gazelle is caught in it, he strives with it awhile, 
and struggles in it, and labours at it, to escape; 
and when it has overcome him, and he is wearied 
by it, he becomes still, and remains in it; and this 
is what is termed [in a prov. mentioned below] 
his becoming at peace with it: (S, * TA:) or it is a 
staff, or stick, tied to a snare, which is hidden in 


the earth, for catching the gazelle; having cords 
of sinew; when his fore leg enters the snare, the 
cords of sinew become tied in knots upon that 
leg; and when he leaps to escape, and stretches 
out his fore leg, he strikes with that staff, or stick, 
his other fore leg and his hind leg, and breaks 
them. (AHeyth, TA.) p SjiJI fa fa He 

struggled with the ‘fa and then became at peace 
with it [see above] is a prov. applied to him who 
opposes the counsel, or opinion, of a people, 
and then is obliged to agree: (S, * TA:) or to him 
who falls into a case, and struggles in it, and then 
becomes still. (TA.) And it is said in another

liable to perish], and when they are scattered, or 
dispersed, by night, and [liable to be] attacked, or 
destroyed, by the beasts of prey: so says ISk: Az

they might fall, and perish. (TA.) ‘fa A mode, or

hoofed animal] ejects from its stomach, (Az, S, * 
IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, *) and eats again, (K,) or 
chews, or ruminates, (Az, IAth, Msb,) or to chew, 
or ruminate; (S;) as also J. ‘ fa: (K:) it is said to 
belong to the same predicament as fa. (Mgh.) 
Hence the saying, j CiitAI U Jisi V I 
will not do that as long as the flow of milk and the 
cud go [the former] downwards and [the latter] 
upwards. (S, A. * [See also s jA]) And 0-^

alluding to the beasts' becoming full of food, and 
then lying down and not ceasing to ruminate 
until the time of milking. (IAar, TA.) And fafa V

rancour, or malice, against his subjects:: or, as 
some say, cross he will not conceal a secret: (TA:) 
and ‘fa fa fafa I* and ‘fa fa fafa l*

affected with rancour, or malice: (TA in art. fa-:)

speak of it. (TA in art. f^S.) — — Also

camels that do so: none do so but those that 
usually bring forth in the season called

so that are red [or brown], and such as are of a 
white hue intermixed with red ( m's . ^' I), and such 
as are ash-coloured: never, or scarcely ever, such 
as are of a dark gray colour without any 
admixture of white, because of the thickness of 
their skins, and the narrowness of their insides, 
and the hardness of their flesh. (IAar, TA. [See

epithet, (T, Mgh, TA,) and the latter, (Mgh, Msb,) 
applied alike to the horse and the mare: (T, Mgh,

denoting what is a fault, for which the horse may 
be returned; (T, Mgh, TA;) i. e., that habitually 
takes his own way, so that his rider cannot turn 
him from it; (T, TA;) or as explained before; 
(Mgh;) the other meaning being quick, or swift, 
and brisk, lively, and sprightly; and this does 
not imply a fault (T, Mgh, TA) for which he may 
be returned. (T, TA.) — — [Hence,] (assumed 
tropical:) Anything [i. e. a man or any animal]

(S;) the two months to which it is applied being 
[said to be] so called because, when the months 
were named, these two fell in the season of the 
freezing of water: (ISd, L, Msb:) [but this 
derivation seems to have been invented when the 
two months thus named had fallen back, into, or 
beyond, the winter; for when they received this 
appellation, the former of them evidently 
commenced in March, and the latter ended in 
May; therefore I hold the opinion of M. Caussin 
de Perceval, that they were thus called because 
falling in a period when the earth had become dry 
and hard by reason of paucity of rain, from Aik, 
an epithet applied to land upon which rain has 
not fallen, or from <_sAA, an epithet applied to an 
eye that sheds few tears; which opinion is

who named it thus was Kaab Ibn-Lu-ei; and he is 
related to have said that it was thus 
called because Kureysh used to gather themselves 
together to Kusei, [on that day,] in [the building 
called] jlj; (TA:) accord, to the R, Kaab Ibn- 
Lu-ei was the first who collected a congregation 
on the day of 4 jA, which was not called 
save since the coming of El-Islam; [or it was not 
generally thus called before El-Islam; for it is 
added,] and he was the first who named it AAI; 


for Kureysh used to congregate to him on this 
day, and he used to preach to them, and to put 
them in mind of the mission of the apostle of 
God, informing them that he should be of his 
descendants, and bidding them to follow him and 
to believe in him: (TA:) or, as some say, it was 
thus called in the time of El-Islam because of 
their congregating [thereon] in the mosque: 
accord, to a trad., the Ansar named it thus, 
because of their congregating thereon: (TA:) or it 
was thus named because God collected thereon 
the materials of which Adam was created: (I Ab:) 
those who say AiJI regard it as an epithet, 
meaning that this day collects men much; 
comparing it to » JA and and (TA:) the 

pi. is jA (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and A*A (Msb, K)

of which the last is pi. of 3-*A, [as well as of AA ;

either of the other pis. mentioned above]. 

In like manner you say -ALII [The prayer of

usage, Alii alone. (Mgh.) — — Alii, with 
the ? quiescent, is also a name for [The week; i. 
e.] the days of the week [collectively]; of which 
the Arabs are said, by IAar, to have reckoned the 
Sabbath (cinUl [i. e. Saturday]) as the first, 
though they called Sunday the first of the days. 
(Msb.) — — Aa. is also syn. with

[after it had been unsettled in his mind, or] after 
considering what might be its issues, or results, 
and saying at one time, I will do thus, and 
at another time, I will do thus. (AHeyth.) 414 : 
see j4> in two places. ^4- and l J4-t [are 
mentioned together, but not explained, in the 
TA: the former signifies, and probably, judging 
from analogy, the latter likewise, as also j £ >4, 
One who collects much; or who collects 
many things]. — — 414 3 jJ: see £4 ,4**. 

Anything of which the several component parts 
are collected, brought, gathered, or drawn, 

together. (IDrd, K.) [Hence,] as an epithet, 

applied to a woman, it means Short. (TA.) 

[Hence also,] 33^1 £4 The cluster of 
the Pleiades: (IDrd:) or persons who collect 
together for the rain of the Pleiades, which is the 
rain called 3-4311, looking for the fruitfulness and 

herbage resulting from it. (IAar.) And ^4

multitude or collection, of men, or people, 
(S, Msb, K,) of various tribes; (S, K;) as also ^4

state of dispersion. (Ham p. 302.) ^4 also 

signifies The place [either properly or tropically] 
which comprises the origin of anything; (K, TA;) 
the source of descent or extraction of people; and 
hence applied by I Ab to main tribes from which 


other tribes are derived; or, as some say, used by 
him as meaning various classes of men, such as 

are termed jd 33^ and 4“ji. (TA.) [And The 

main, or most essential, part of a thing.

[The congregational mosque;] the mosque in 
which the [congregational] prayers of Friday are 
performed; because it collects the people for a 
certain time; (Msb;) and you may also say, 44 
£*4, meaning £*4 'o 4 , (S, K,) like as you 
say 344 1 3^1 and u44' 4, [the latter] as 
meaning asP ?3-31l 4; for it is not allowable to 
prefix a noun to another of the same meaning 
except with this kind of subaudition; or, accord, 
to Fr, the Arabs used to do so because of the 
difference of the two words themselves: (S:) 
or £*411 J?-" is a mistake: (K:) so says Lth; but 
all others allow it; for the Arabs prefix a subst. to 
another signifying the same thing, and also to its 
epithet, as in the phrases in the Kur -411 [ch. 
xcviii. v. 4] and 4 3 [ch. xlvi. v. 15]: (Az, 

TA:) [pi. £*4.] — — <*4 34> [A great town 
comprising a large population; a comprehensive 
great town]. (Msb in art. 0“ [where it is given as 
the explanation of <4i]; and K in art. l S 3 [where 
it is less properly given as the explanation 

of 44].) <*4 and 44: see £4

with £4-11; last signification. £4 JjI A she- 

ass pregnant when beginning to be so. (S, O, K.) 

i 44 A [collar of the kind called] 34; (S, 

K;) because it collects together the two hands to 

the neck: (S:) pi. £*4. (TA.) £*4 3^ An 

affair that collects people together: or, as Er- 
Raghib says, a momentous affair, on account of 
which people collect themselves together; as 
though the affair itself collected them. (TA.) 
[Similar to this is the saying,] p-4 J£l 44 smUl 

Prayer is a collector of all people. (Msb.) It 

is said of Mohammad, (Msb,) eP £*'4 t 43 
He used to speak comprehensive but 
concise language; language conveying many 
meanings in few words. (Msb, K. [In the CK, 4 1 
is omitted.]) And hence the saying of ’Omar Ibn- 
'Abd-el-'Azeez, cijij V 4£ ^ull jL)! jil tiiy. 


jJSlI £*14, meaning [I wonder at him who vies 
with men in endeavouring to show his superiority 
of intelligence,] how it is that he does not [know 
the way to] confine himself to conciseness, and 
abstain from superfluity, of speech. (TA.) In like 
manner, (TA,) it is said in a trad., 41 £*4 Au-b 1 , 
meaning I have had communicated to me the 
Kur-an, (K, TA,) in which many meanings are 
comprised in a few words. (TA.) At 3 1 3* £*I3P, 
also, signifies Prayers, or supplications, 
combining petitions for good and right objects of 
desire with praise of God and with the 
general prescribed observances proper to the 
case. (TA.) You say also, £44 “dll Ai4 3 1

forms of praise. (Msb.) [See also £4-] 343 

£*4 A man who combines such qualities that he

all kinds of good qualities. (TK in that art.) 

£4 "3d A beast fit for the ( -*4 and the [i- e. 
for the saddle of either of the kinds thus called].

accord, to ISh, (TA,) A hecamel, and a she- 
camel, that fails of putting forth the tooth 
called 4 at the time expected; expl. by 44 '-44; 
but this is not said except after four years: (K:) so 
in the copies of the K; but correctly, accord, to the 
O and TS, this is not said after four years, [app. 
reckoned from the usual time of 3 j3j, for this is 
in the ninth year, or, sometimes, in the 
eighth,] without the exceptive particle. 
(TA.) 44 used as a subst.: see the next 
preceding paragraph. £*4' [Collecting,

denotative of state with respect to the 3 j“: and 
the reason why aAS is not here said [instead 
of u'-3] is that 3 j“ is sometimes masc. (Mgh.) 
And 44LYI £*4 j* A 3*4 [Do thou that

aged, (K, TA,) so that her teeth have become 
short, and almost gone. (TA.) — It is also a sing, 
having the meaning of a pi., (S, K,) without any 
proper sing, of its own: (S:) its pi. is d)>»A: and 
its fern, is AA: (S, K:) and the pi. of this last 
is jA, though by rule it should be formed by 
the addition of I and a to the sing., like as the pi. 
of jA is formed by the addition of j and u; (S;) 
the original form from which £A is changed 
being AjUA; or it is ^A; it is not 
because jA is not an epithet, like as jA 1 is, of 
which the pi. is )A; (L;) for it is determinate, 
though of the measure of an epithet, which 
is indeterminate; (AAF;) and though it is in 
concordance with the noun which precedes it, 
like an epithet, it is shown to be not an epithet 
by its not having a broken pi.: (L:) it is a simple 
corroborative; (S, K;) and so are Oj*Ai and il»A 
and £A; not used as an inchoative nor as 
an enunciative nor as the agent of a verb nor as 
the objective complement of a verb, like as are 
some other corroboratives, such as Aii 
and A- and A. (S.) You say, ^A 1 A- All [i 
took my right, or due, all of it, or altogether]: 
and £A ij-al Ai j [i saw the women, all of 
them, or all together]: the last word in this and 
similar cases being imperfectly declinable, and 
determinate word: (Sudot;, TA:) and 1 jA 

[They came, all of them, or all together]: 
and u#A' fA j [I saw them, all of them, or all 
together]: and uj*A' A cj j A [i passed by them, 
all of them, or all together]. (Msb.) Fr mentions 
the phrases, jA jAill AA [The palace pleased 
me, all of it, or altogether], and «UA Jill [The 
house, all of it, or altogether], with the accus. 
case, as denotative of state; but does not 
allow Oj*A nor jA to be used otherwise than as 
corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows u“Ai to 
be used as a denotative of state; and this is 
correct; and accord, to both these ways is related 
the trad., IjAs and OAA [And 

pray ye sitting, all of you, or all together]; though 
some make u#«A [here] to be a corroborative of 
a pronoun understood in the accus. case, 
as though the speaker said, 0#Ai AA [I mean 
you, all of you, or all together]: (K in art. A : ) 
or uj*A in this case is a corruption committed 
by the relaters in the first age; and he is in error 
who says that it is in the accus. case as a 
denotative of state, for corroboratives are 
determinate, and the denotative of state is 
literally or virtually indeterminate. (Msb.) 
[Respecting the usage of this corroborative 
together with others similar to it, see You 
say also, AA 4 1 jA, and fAA, with damm to 
the f, [They came, all of them, or all together,] (S, 


Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by ISk. (Msb.) And 
you say, All JU1I AAs [i took, or received, the 
property, all of it, or altogether]. (Msb.) And 
i also, is used as a corroborative: (S, Msb:) 
as in the saying lA?- 1 jA, meaning They came, 
all of them: (S:) and Jlill like All 

[explained above]: (Msb:) and A»^ occurs as its 
fern.; but this is extr. (TA.) and j-A> 

(S, Msb, K,) the latter anomalous, like iiA“ 
and m jxi &c., (TA,) A place of collecting, and the 
like: (S, Msb, * K:) [pi. jA-«] 

[Hence,] u-oA ^As in the Kur [xviii. 59], 
means The place where the two seas meet. (Bd.) 
And in like manner, where it is said in a 
trad., AA A 0 jjj ^A 1 A [in which A 

seems to have been dropped by the copyist 
between and ow,] the meaning is, [And he 
struck with his hand] the place where my neck 
and my shoulder-blade meet. (TA.) [Hence also 
the phrase AA jA-i, explained above: see jA ; 
near the end of the paragraph. And jjAI j-Ai, 
meaning The concurrences of affairs, or of 
circumstances, or of events.] — — A place in 
which people collect, assemble, or congregate: 
(Msb, * TA:) and [in like manner,] J, AA 
signifies an assembly-room; a sitting room in 
which people assemble: (TA:) [pi. of both AA] 
You say, gA-dl JAj A — A A 

[This language, or discourse, is more, or 
most, penetrating into the ears, and more, or 
most, circulating in the places of assembly]. (TA.) 
— — See also iA, as syn. with ALA, in 

two places; and see 10, first sentence. [The 

whole of anything, considered as the place in 
which the several parts thereof are collected: see 
an instance voce —A and see also jAJ>.] 
<*Ai ; (s, K,) and A jA^ (TA,) An affair 
determined, resolved, or decided, upon: (S, K:) 
an affair agreed upon. (TA.) [The former 
signification applies to both of the 
abovementioned phrases: the latter 

signification, perhaps, only to the latter phrase.] 

AA* Ai. [A discourse in rhyming prose, 

or the like,] in which is no flaw, or defect. (Ibn- 
’ Abbad, K.) j-A« £ A A year of dearth, drought, 
sterility, or unfruitfulness: (Ks, K:) because it is 
an occasion of people's collecting together in the 
place where herbage, or plenty, is found. (Ks.) 
And Ali s 5 U ; (s, TA,) like AA; (TA;) [in Gol. 
Lex., erroneously, AA ; ] a nd AA*, like AA; 
(TA;) A desert in which people collect themselves 
together, not separating themselves, from fear of 
losing their way, or perishing, and the like; as 
though the desert itself collected them. (S, TA.) 
And AA* tjiajl, like AA ; a land of dearth, 
drought, sterility, or unfruitfulness, wherein the 


camels upon which people journey are not 
dispersed to pasture. (TA.) <*A?: see £A. AA*:

thing. (S, Sgh, L, K.) It is said in the Kur [xi. 
105], gA 4] A* £ jj illj That is a day for which 
mankind shall be collected. (TA.) — — See 
also jA. £*A [A place in which a thing becomes 
collected, brought together, or the like; or in 
which things have become so; where they collect 
themselves, come together, or unite; or in which 
they are comprised, or contained; a place in 
which is a collection of things]. You say, AAJI

beings; for the spiritual beings are of three kinds; 
the good being the angels; and the evil being the 
devils (u4=Ui); and the middle kind, among 
whom are good and evil, being the O9; as is 
shown by the first twelve verses of ch. lxxii. of the 
Kur: (Er-Raghib, TA:) or it here means intelligent 
invisible bodies, predominantly of the fiery, or of 
the aerial, quality: or a species of souls, or spirits, 
divested of bodies: or human souls separate 
from their bodies: (Bd:) or the 09 are the angels 
[exclusively]; (K;) these being so called in the 
Time of Ignorance, because they were 
concealed, or because they concealed themselves, 
from the eyes: so, accord, to some, in the Kur 
[xviii. 48], where it is said that Iblees was of 
the 09: and so, as some say, in the Kur [vi. too], 
where it is said that they called the 09 partners of 
God: (TA:) but some reject the explanation in the 
K, because the angels were created of light, and 
the 09 of fire; and the former do not propagate 
their kind, nor are they to be described as males 
and females; contrary to the case of 
the 09; wherefore it is generally said that in the 
phrase [in the Kur xviii. 48, above mentioned] 'ij 
uk (Ik L«Sj, what is excepted is disunited 
in kind from that from which the exception is 
made, or that Iblees had adopted the dispositions 
of the 09: (MF, TA:) or, as some say, the Of- were 
a species of the angels, who were the guardians of 
the earth and of the gardens of Paradise: (TA:) 
l also, signifies the same as 09: (S, Msb, K:) 
so in the last verse of the Kur: (S:) in the Kur 
xxxvii. 158 meaning the angels, whom certain of 
the Arabs worshipped; (TA;) and whom they 
called the daughters of God: (Fr, TA:) a single

being an inflammatory tumour in the [pleura, or] 
membrane within the ribs: (Msb:) or an ulcer, or 
a purulent pustule, that comes within a man's

an ulcer that penetrates into the belly: or the

but <?4 is mentioned in the Msb as the primary

the j* were augmentative as well as the u, there 
would be two augmentative letters at the 
beginning of the noun, and this may not be in 
substs. nor in epithets that are not conformable 
to augmented verbs; and if the u were made an 
essential part of the word, the noun would be 


a quadriliteral-radical, and augmentative letters 
are not prefixed to words of this class except 
nouns conformable to their verbs, like £A-A: (S,

unprofitable; for in his opinion, all the letters of

like], 44 j4 signifying the “ cover ” of a jar, (K, 
TA,) whether of wood or of baked clay. (TA.) [If 
this be the true derivation, the phrase may have 
originated from a person's asking of another 
the loan or gift of ajar, and the latter's replying “ 
Yea; and I will give thee a jar-stand and a cover; ” 
meaning “ I will do what thou requirest, and

[BOOKI.] 


Aboo-Hobahib, (K,) is said to have been a 
niggardly man, who never lighted any but a faint 
fire, fearing to attract guests, so that his fire 
became proverbial. (S, K.) El-Kumeyt says, 
describing swords, ^ j lS Ji 
j -^ 1=44 [The beholders see, in the sides of 
the blades thereof, and the extremities, the 
semblance of the fire of the fire-fly]: (S:) here the 
poet has made imperfectly decl., regarding 
it as a fern, [proper] name [of the fly above 
mentioned]. (TA.) Or jli (S, K) and 

simply s (S) signify The fire that is struck by 
a horse's hoofs: (Fr, S:) or the sparks of fire that 
are made to fly forth in the air by the collision of 
stones: or the sparks that fall from the pieces of 
wood that are used for producing fire [by 
means of friction]: (K:) or they are derived 
from (lAar, K,) signifying “ weakness,” 

(IAar, TA,) [and their meaning is faint fire.] 

fl A flying insect resembling the [species 
of locust called] (K, * TA,) spotted with 

yellow and green: when people see it, they 
say, v4j 4 4 [Spread forth thy wings (4 -iAw),

which are adorned with red and yellow. (TA.) '4=s 
meaning 4w=s as in the phrase I I4=»- [Loved, 
beloved, affected, loved, or approved, is the thing, 
or affair; or lovely, charming, or excellent, is it]; 
(K;) and in 4u 144 [Loved, beloved, &c., is Zeyd]; 
(S;) is composed of 4“--, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) a verb of 
praise, in the pret. form, invariable, 

originally (Fr, S,) and 4, (Sb, Fr, S, K,) its 
agent, (S,) which together constitute it a single 
word, (Sb, S, K,) a noun, (Sb, K,) or occupying the 
place of a noun, (S,) governing the noun 
[particularized by praise] that follows it in the 
nom. case; (Sb, S, K;) the place that it occupies in 
construction making it virtually in the nom. case 
as an inchoative, and the noun that follows it 
being its enunciative: (S:) [but see what follows.] 
It is used in the same manner as a prov.; (Sb, K;) 
[i. e., it is not altered to agree in number or 
gender with the noun particularized by praise, 
which follows it;] remaining the same when used 
in the dual and pi. and fem. sense; so that one 
says, '4*. and and 0 j 4 jll and 4a, and diii 
and L-Iil and [&c.]; (Ibn-Keysan, TA;) and 1-4^ 
siyfy not »4=“-; (Sb, S, K; *) which shows that 
the noun that follows it may not be regarded as a 
substitute for 14 (S:) [but see what follows.] It 
is allowable, but bad, to say, 14^ 4 j. (TA.) [There 
are, however, various opinions respecting | 4=>- 
and the noun that follows it.] Some hold that 14=^ 
is a noun, composed of 4^ and fy and is an 
inchoative, and that the noun particularized by 
praise is its enunciative; or that the former is an 


enunciative, and the latter an inchoative, 
reversing the usual order: others hold that 4^ is 
a verb in the pret. form; and '4 its agent; and that 
the noun particularized by praise may be an 
inchoative, of which 14^- is the enunciative; or it 
may be an enunciative of which the inchoative is 
suppressed, so that 4j '4^ is for > 14=* 
4j [Loved, or beloved, &c., is this person: he is 
Zeyd], or 4j c >441 '4^ [loved, &c., is this 
person: the person praised is Zeyd]: others hold 
that I4=>- is a pret. verb, composed of 4-4. and '4 
and that the noun following it is its agent; but 
this is the weakest of opinions: one also says, in

it lays its eggs in distant sands: [the truth is, that 
it drinks seldom: the male bird has a pouch,

fills this with water for the supply of himself and 
his mate:] and Az further says, We used, when

taste than those of the domestic hen and than 
those of the ostrich: and others say that it brings 
its food from a greater distance than any other 
bird; sometimes from a distance of many days' 
journey: also, that it is constantly provided with a 
thin excrement, or dung, which it voids upon the 
hawk when pursued by the latter; thus saving 
itself, by preventing the hawk from continuing its 
flight, and, as some say, causing its feathers 
to drop off: whence the prov., o? jfo': [see

prov. is, lS [Such a one is dying

see ciiliL. is a particle, used in three senses: 
(Mughnee:) it is a particle denoting the end of an 
extent; (Mughnee, K;) which is its 

predominant meaning; (Mughnee;) asserted by 
some to be always its meaning: (TA:) 

and denoting a cause, or motive: and syn. with V] 
as an exceptive; (Mughnee, K;) which last is the 

rarest, and is mentioned by few. (Mughnee.) 

It is used as a preposition governing the gen. 
case, in the same manner as (S, Mughnee) in 
respect of meaning and government, 

(Mughnee,) denoting the end of an extent; (S;) 
[signifying To, till, until, or to the time of;] but 
the word that it so governs must be a noun 
properly so called, not a pronoun except in a case 
of poetic license; and must signify the last part, 
or portion, of what is signified by that 
which precedes as in the saying, ^AkJI cJSi 
j [I ate the fish, even to its head]; or must 
be prefixed to the word signifying that part, or 
portion, as in the saying, [in the Kur xcvii. last 
verse,] jl^ll [A night of peace, or 

of salutation, is it, until the time of the rising of 
the dawn]. (Mughnee.) It is also followed by a 
mansoob aor., as in [I journeyed 

until I entered it, here virtually 

meaning u 1 being here understood 

after and the u 1 together with the verb being 
rendered in grammatical analysis by an inf. n. 
governed in the gen. case by [so that u 1 

means 4UI lt^]: this is one of the 

cases in which differs from Jj; for one may 
not say, J! ^5“ [with u 1 understood 

after Jl]: and in the same sense it is used in the 
phrase, [in the Kur xx. 93,] ^>“4111 £?■ 

[Until Moses return to us]. (Mughnee.) It 

is also syn. with 3^, denoting a cause or motive 
[of action &c., signifying To the end that, in order 
that, or so that], as in the saying, 

4kkll [Become a Muslim, to the end that, or in 
order that, or so that, thou mayest enter 


Paradise]; being in this case, likewise, followed 
by a mansoob aor. (Mughnee.) — — It is also 
used [as a preposition virtually governing the 
gen. case, u 1 being understood after it,] in the 
sense of 1], meaning Except, or unless, likewise 
followed by a mansoob aor., as in the following 
verse: 411^1 Ikj - ^ (_]>* Jaall - 1 

J43 [xhe giving of superfluities is not 
liberality: (giving is not liberality) except, or 
unless, (or here we may also say until,) thou be 
bountiful when little is in thy possession]. 

(Mughnee.) It is also a conjunction, like j, 

[signifying And, or rather even,] (S, Mughnee,) 
but on three conditions: first, that the 

word following it and conjoined by it be a noun 
properly so called, not a pronoun: secondly, that 
this noun signify a part, or portion, of what 
is signified by that which precedes as in ^ 
sliill [The pilgrims arrived: even those 

on foot], and 4-4lj 4A4JI cJSi [1 ate the fish: 
even its head]: thirdly, that the noun following it 
and conjoined by it denote either the greatest or 
the least [literally or figuratively] of what are 
included in the signification of the noun 
that precedes ,3“-, as in cUkVI <>“ll Cj '-“ [Men 
have died: even the prophets], and 41 jlj 

[The people visited thee: even the 

cuppers]. (Mughnee.) It is also used as an 

inceptive particle, (S, Mughnee,) preceding a 
nominal proposition, (Mughnee,) as in the 
following verse (of Jereer [so in a copy of the 
S]): "i <Ik.i elk klkkj Ikelk^ dill j Ika 

[And the slain ceased not to emit their blood into 
the Tigris, so that the water of the Tigris was of a 
mixed colour consisting of red and white]: (S, 
Mughnee:) and preceding a verbal proposition, of 
which the verb is a pret., as in the phrase, [in the 
Kur vii. 93,] I jllaj ' jaA [So that they became 

numerous, and said]: (Mughnee:) and preceding 
a marfooa aor., as in the phrase, [in the Kur ii. 
210,] 3 J [So that the Apostle said, or, 

as in the S, so that this was the case: the Apostle 
said], accord, to him who reads J j4; (IHsh, in De 
Sacy's “ Anthol. Gramm. Ar.,” p. 82 of the Arabic 
text;) others reading J j4, which, as well as J j4, 

here means J4. (Jel.) [Respecting the cases 

in which the mansoob aor. is used after <_s4>-, and 
those in which the marfooa aor. is used, 
the following observations are made.] When 
precedes a future, the latter is mansoob, by 
reason of u 1 understood before it, as in the 
saying, l*^-' [I journeyed to El- 

Koofeh until I entered it: see above]: (S:) it is not 
mansoob unless the verb is a future: if it is future 
with respect to the time of speaking, it must be

c 


[BOOKI.] 


mansoob, as in cs-J 'J} jf-jj ^k [cited above]: if 
the verb is future with respect to what precedes, 
only, it may be mansoob, as in J >3 jll J 34 
[mentioned above]; or it maybe marfooa; but not 
unless [somehow] denoting a present time; 
(Mughnee;) and if present with respect to the 
time of speaking, it must be marfooa, as in the 
saying, Jk3 Jj kj, [I have journeyed 

to El-Koofeh so that now I am entering it]; 
(S, Mughnee; *) but if not really present, it is not 
marfooa unless denoting a past event as though it 
were present, as in J jll J 34 Jk 
[explained above]; nor may it be marfooa unless 
denoting an effect of what precedes it; so that you 
may not say, ^k k j^, nor erk k k 

unless the k is regarded as prefixed to the 
entire affirmative phrase that follows it, nor 3* 
kkk Jk kju; nor may it be marfooa unless 
it denote a complement to what precedes it, so 
that you may not say Jki ^k lS ji“, as the 
inchoative would in this case be without 

an enunciative. (Mughnee.) [The following 

verse of El-Farezdak is cited in the Mughnee as 
an ex. of used as an inceptive particle: kklja 
jkkkj Jk and it is there 

added that okill Jk must be understood in this 
verse before ^k: but I rather think that ^k is 
here a conjunctive particle, and that the meaning 
is, And alas, my wonder! the people revile me: 
even Kuleyb revile me, as though their father 
were Nahshal and as though he were Mujashi'.] 

It should be observed that ^k may be used 

in three different ways in some sentences: thus 
you may say, using it as a preposition (in 
the sense of 3 ^k SibdJI kl£i ,(Jt [I ate the 
fish, even to its head]; and, using it as a 
conjunction, ^k [even its head]; and, using 
it as an inceptive particle, j [for ^k 
iljSU so that its head was eaten]. (Mughnee.) — 
— It is said in the K that ^k renders makhfood 
and marfooa and mansoob; and that therefore Fr 
said, « J 2 a? lA j k [“ I shall die with 

something respecting ^k (remaining unsettled) 
in my mind ”]: this is said on the 

supposition that ^k deviates in government 
from an established rule, which is, that a particle 
which governs one part of speech governs that 
only; those, for instance, which render mansoob 
and mejzoom governing verbs only, and the 
particles that govern nouns governing none but 
nouns: but the truth is, that ^k governs only the 
gen. case; a marfooa noun or aor. after it would 
be so without it, as ^k in this case is only an 
inceptive particle; and a mansoob aor. after it is 
rendered so by u 1 understood, so that ^k in this 
case virtually governs a noun in the gen. case 


[as has been shown above]: therefore the remark 
quoted above from the K is faulty, and confounds 
things that should be distinguished. (MF, TA.) — 
— Some say that ^k is [a noun] of the 
measure J*a, from i -kll the ceasing from a 
thing, having finished it; or the becoming 
unoccupied by a thing; like Jk from kill; but Az 
disapproves of this, because, were it so, the 
pronunciation termed -dkl would be allowable in 
its case, and it is not so: he says, is a particle, 

not a noun, nor a verb. (TA.) — — 3 k is 
originally k jk [Till when? until when? or 
how long?]: the I of k is elided because the 
expression is used interrogatively, like as it is 
when any preposition is prefixed to it if used 

interrogatively, as in ft and 34 and f=-. (S.) 

In the dial, of Hudheyl, is said for Jk. (L.) k 
ipL sii j 'Jl I j jj, or Jk, (as in different copies of 
the K in art. k j,) They left not of them so much 
as thou mightest rub thy hands therewith and

dust in his [the former's] face, to show this man 
who was sitting with her that he should not draw

say, I j* This is forbidden, or unlawful, to

meeting another whom he feared, in a sacred 
month, used to say, j I jL*., meaning It is 

rigorously forbidden to thee [to commit an act of 
hostility against me] in this month: and the 
latter, thereupon, would abstain from any 
aggression against him: and so, on the day of 
resurrection, the polytheists, when they see the 
punishment, will say to the angels, thinking that 
it will profit them: (Lth, S: *) but Az says that I' 
Ab and his companions explain these words 
[occurring in the Kur xxv. 24] otherwise, i. e., as 
said by the angels, and meaning, the joyful 
annunciation is forbidden to be made to you: and 
accord, to El-Hasan, the former word will be said 
by the sinners, and the latter is said by God, 
meaning it will be forbidden to them to be 
granted refuge or protection as they used to be in 
their former life in the world: but Az adds, it is 
more proper to regard the two words as 
composing one saying: (TA:) and the latter word 
is a corroborative of the former, like cjjU in the 
expression uli (Bd.) The same words in the 
Kur xxv. 55 signify A strong mutual repugnance, 
or incongruity; as though each said what one says 
who seeks refuge or protection from another: or, 
as some say, a defined limit. (Bd.) A man says to 
another, “Dost thou so and so, O such a one?” 
and the latter replies Ij?-?-, or j '(>?-»■, or 
I Ijii, meaning [I pray for] preservation, and 
acquitment, from this thing; a meaning reducible 
to that of prohibition, and of a thing that 
is prohibited. (Sb.) The Arabs say, on the 
occasion of a thing that they disapprove, J, <1 
1 jki-, with damm, meaning, May it be averted. 

(S.) Homeyd Ibn-Thowr says, ur-*- 1 u 1 

< 3 ! ls-^ meaning, And I 

purposed doing to her a forbidden action: 
and verily the like of her is one to whom that 
which is forbidden is done. (S, K.) 1 is also 
explained as signifying [app. meaning 

a thing from which one is bound to refrain, from 
a motive of respect or reverence;] and to have 

this meaning in the verse above. (Az.) Also, 

the first of these words, Any [i. e. garden, or 
walled garden of palm-trees,] which one 
prohibits [to the public]. (S.) And That 


[space] which is comprised by [the curved wall 
called] the (S, A, Mgh, K,) which

north-west] side; (S, A, K;) on the side of the

of the horse: (S, A, Msb, K:) and a mare kept for 
breeding; (A;) as though her womb were 
forbidden to all but generous horses: (T:) but in 
the latter sense the sing, is scarcely ever used; 
though its pi., the first of the following forms, (as 
well as the second, A,) is used to signify mares 
kept for breeding: (K:) j » jp-?-, as a sing., is said 
by F and others to be a barbarism: it occurs in a

of his right hand for stealing a thing of the value

stripes [as is also that of the person who has 
committed the crime of drunkenness]: (T, L:) the

second, because they prevent one's committing

punishments; (T, Mgh, L;) or because the limits 
thereof are determined: (Mgh:) the latter kind

transmitted: (Msb:) [and talk, or discourse:] and 
[in like manner] 4 33 j4i signifies a thing that is

signifies a wonderful thing: (IB, TA:) it has 
been asserted, says MF, that there is no 
difference between 33 j4l and 4jj.iv in usage, and 
in denoting what is good and what is evil; 
in contradiction to such as say that the former 
peculiarly signifies that [kind of story] in which 
there is no profit nor any truth; such as amatory 
stories, and the like fictions of the Arabs: Fr 
asserts it to signify peculiarly a laughable and an 
absurd story; differing from 44=-: and Ibn- 
Hisham El-Lakhmee, in his Expos of the Fs, says 
that it is only used to denote what is bad, or evil: 
but Lb replies against him, in his Expos., that it is 
sometimes used to denote what is good; as in a 
saying mentioned by Yaakoob, which see below: 
(TA:) the pi. of *44 is -441, contr. to analogy, 
(S, K,) said by Fr to be pi. of 4 44 and

is not the case; (TA;) and g*34 and 3- 33k are also 
pis. of 4 jjiv, (K, TA,) sometimes occurring; the 
latter, rare. (TA.) You say, 4*=*. 44 4 (TA)

to what comes from another than the Prophet; or

applied to a saying of the Prophet: (Kull p. 152:) 
the word in this sense, i. e. the 4 jjiv of the 
Prophet, has for its pi. only 4u4J; and therefore 
Sb mentions it in the category of those 
words which have pis. anomalously formed; such 
as 4 j>, pi. i4jlc.i; and 314, pi. 3144 (TA.) 
441 written at the end of a quotation of a part 
of a trad, is for 4411 i ja) Read the tradition.] — 
— 34 *44 [A holy tradition or narration] 

means what God has told to his prophet 
by inspiration, or by a dream, or in sleep, and the 
prophet has told in his own phraseology: the Kur- 
an is esteemed above this, because [it is 
held that] its words also were revealed: (KT:) that 
of which the words are from the apostle, but the 
meaning is from God, by inspiration, or by 
a dream, or in sleep. (Kull p. 288.) 33I4 : see 33 4

that the poet [Sakhr] does not make it decl. is an 
evidence of the correctness of the assertion of As; 
for, were it deck, he would have said 3 =“- 3^“ if it 
consisted of two nouns whereof the former was 
prefixed to the other so as to govern it in the gen. 
case, or 13=“- 3^“ if it were a compound; as it is 
indeterminate: and its being made deck by 
Homeyd does not show it to be not significant of 
a sound; for sometimes an expression significant 
of a sound consists of two nouns whereof the

series of mansions [or constellations], the bounds

alludes to the numbers of the months and years 
and all other times: [but properly 


speaking,] is here an inf. n.: (Zj, TA:) or, 
accord, to Akh, a pi. of AjIA; (s, TA;) and so says 
AHeyth: or, accord, to some, it is here a proper 
subst., signifying the firmament. (TA.) U.A in 
the Kur vi. 96 is held by Akh to be for gA^j, 
meaning AA [as in the phrase quoted above, 
from the Kur lv. 4, accord, to the first 
explanation]. (TA.) And AA 

All signifies All Jc. 4111A [On God be it to reckon 
with thee: see also All 3iA], (TA.) Az says that 
the reckoning in buying and selling 

is termed mA- because one knows thereby what 
is sufficient. (TA.) AAI £j>- All Jj i n the Kur [ii.

divert Him from reckoning with another. (TA.) 
And ylA jj*j ills (jj ji, in the Kur [ii. 208, 

&c., He supplieth whom He willeth, without 
reckoning], means without sparing, or scanting; 
as when a man expends without reckoning: but 
the phrase is variously explained, as meaning 
without appointing for any one what is deficient: 
or without fearing that any one will call Him to 
account for it: or without the receiver's thinking 
that He will bestow upon him, or without his 
reckoning upon the supply; so that it may be 
from A “ he thought,” or from AA “ he 
reckoned. ” (L, TA.) The saying, cited by IAar, L 
A A. 53 AUAI JA. as related by J [in the S], but 
correctly A~], (TA,) means [O Juml, mayest 
thou be given rain] without reckoning, and

similar to a nd AS j occurs in the saying of En- 

Nabighah, Ali j AA. 

Al [And she completed a hundred, in which was 
her pigeon; and she was quick in the mode of

the more approved, (TA,) of the dialects of all the

unrestricted, the Arabs mean thereby (4,

dry and white,] in particular; and that this is the 
best kind of fodder; that horses thrive upon 
it, and it is one of the best pastures for camels, or 
for camels and sheep and goats; a good supply in

but one tense and no inf. n.] is a pronoun 
implied, relating to the inf. n. of the preceding 
verb, or to its act. part, n., or to a portion of what 
is meant by the [preceding] general noun: so that 
when one says, Aj ^AA f ft, the meaning is, 
[The party stood, but] their standing, or the 
stander of them, or a portion of them, was 
apart from Zeyd. (Mughnee.) [In the K, its use as 
a verb of this kind is not mentioned; but it is 

there said to govern the gen. case, like cr*=-.] 

It also denotes remoteness from imperfection or 
the like, or freedom therefrom; as in the 
phrase cs-AA J, [I ascribe unto God remoteness 
from every imperfection or the like, or freedom 
therefrom; generally implying wonder or 
admiration, so that it may be rendered, how far, 
or how free, is God from every imperfection!]: 
(Mughnee:) or this phrase means <UI iUi [i seek 
protection by God; or, as often used by late 
writers, and in the present day, God forbid!]; as 
also u^A J, <11; (S, K;) the former being the 
original expression: (S:) it occurs, read in both 
these ways, in the Kur xii. 31 and 51; where it 
implies wonder at the power of God as 
manifested in the creation of such a person 
as Joseph. (Ksh, Bd.) Mbr and IJ and the Koofees 
hold that it is a verb; and that, in the [latter] 
verse the meaning is, Joseph hath kept 
aloof from disobedience for the sake of God; but 
such an interpretation as this is not suitable in 
the case of [the former verse,] i'jp A U <11 (jiA : 
the truth is, that it is a noun, syn. with <■ jAl 
or »*Tjjll, [accord, to different copies of the 
Mughnee, meaning fejjj or Al 3),] as is shown by 
another reading, AlA [ <ll, with tenween, 
like Al j); and by the reading of Ibn- 
Mes'ood, uiA J, <HI, like <HI ~A> : some assert that 
it is a verbal noun, meaning [1 assert myself 
to be free, or clear, to God], or Aijli [I have 
asserted myself &c.]; but its being deck in some 
dials, contradicts this. (Mughnee.) One says also, 
J, A1AIA and .jAA J, AH [Far art thou from being 
included among those of whom I speak! or from 
any cause of reproach! or the like]; both 
meaning the same. (S, K.) And some of the Arabs 
say l (Fr, IAmb, TA,) dropping the I (IAmb, 
TA.) — — Sb says, (S, Mughnee,) with most 
of the Basrees, (Mughnee,) that it is only a 
particle governing the gen. case, (S, Mughnee,) 
syn. with 'ij; (Mughnee;) because, if it were a 
verb, it would be allowable to make it a 
connective to like 1>A; and this he asserts to be 
not allowable. (S.) Mbr says that it is sometimes 
a verb; as is shown by the verse of En-Nabighah 
cited above; and by the saying fyjl cs-AA, because 
a particle cannot be made to 


precede immediately another particle; and 
because it suffers elision, as in the phrase k£A 
fjjl, seeing that elision takes place in nouns and 
verbs only, exclusively of particles: (S, Mughnee 
*:) and IJ and the Koofees say the like: but Mbr 
also holds, in common with El-Jarmee and El- 
Mazinee and Zj and Akh and AZ and Fr and 
Aboo-'Amr EshSheybanee, that it is often a 
particle governing the gen. case, and seldom a 
trans. verb having but one tense and no inf. n., 
because syn. with 'ij. (Mughnee.) — See also 5, in

same; (TA;) [the former meaning he was, or 
became, adapted, disposed, apt, meet, 
suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper, 
for it; which is the most proper meaning of the 
phrase 3 33 as well as of the 

verb 3=*3I ; but this verb has also the former of 
these two meanings.] When a man purchases a 
house, and another lays claim to it, and 
establishes a just evidence of his claim, and the 
judge decides for him according to his evidence, 
one says of him, lS J=*31l ^ 4 . 3)3 1 ja [He has a

manner of going, in which the beast is made to 
exert himself to the very utmost, and which is the 
most fatiguing to the ji-4 [meaning the camel 
that is ridden, or the beast that carries one]: (S, 
Mgh, K:) or a journeying in the beginning, or first 
part, of the night; (Lth, S, K;) which is forbidden: 
(Lth, S, TA:) or, as some say, the fatiguing a 
while, and abstaining a while: (Lth, TA:) but Az 
says that Lth is not correct in either of his 
explanations of this word: (TA:) or an 

obstinate persisting in journeying: or an 

obstinate persisting in journeying until the camel 
that one is riding perishes or breaks down: (K:) 
or, accord, to Az, the correct meaning, confirmed 
by what the Arabs said, is the making the camel 
to go on, and urging him to that which fatigues 
him, and that which is beyond his power, until he 
breaks down with his rider: or, accord, to IAar, 
the jading of the weak [beast] by hard 
journeying. (TA.) It is related in a trad., that 
Mutarrif Ibn-Esh-Shikhkheer said to his son, 
when he took extraordinary pains in religious 
exercises, (S, TA,) and was immoderate therein, 
(TA,) j=4il j (j33l 01= *3311 j 433 jl j3 

[The best of affairs, or actions, or cases, are

the good action is between the two things; and 
the worst kind of journeying is that in which the 
beast is made to exert himself to the very utmost, 
&c.]: (S, TA:) meaning, pursue thou the middle 
course in religious exercises, and burden 
not thyself, lest thou become disgusted; for the

be small. (TA.) 3 =“- contr. of 334 [used as a subst.

epithet, contr. of 334. (Kull.) [As a subst.,] 
its primary signification is Suitableness to the 
requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or 
rightness, truth, reality, or fact; or to 
the exigencies of the case; as the suitableness of 
the foot of a door in respect of its socket, for 
turning round rightly: (Er-Raghib, TA:)

saying, and a religion, and a persuasion, 
considered as involving, or implying, such a 
judgment: (Kull:) to that which is suitable to the 
requirements of wisdom, justice, right, or 
rightness; as when one says that every act of God 
is 3*: to a belief, in a thing, suitable to the reality 
of the case; as when one says that belief in the 
resurrection is 3 *: and to an action, and a saying, 
accordant to what is requisite or obligatory, 
in quality and measure and time; as when one 
says that the action of another is 3*, and that his 
saying is 3*-: (Er-Raghib, TA:) [thus it signifies 
just, proper, right, correct, or true; authentic, 
genuine, sound, valid, substantial, or real; 
established, or confirmed, as a truth or fact: and 
necessary, requisite, or unavoidable: and

the nom. case is used without tenween; but 
when the J is dropped, one says, 34 Y 14. ; (s,

incorrect variation of the relaters of traditions:

T, it is a form of imprecation uttered against a

degree of displeasure,] meaning may she be 
bereft of her husband, or became a widow, so 


that she shall shave off her hair: and Az says

[Now surely] my people have women who have 
wounded and scratched their faces and 
shaven off their hair [on account of what the tribe

says IB, IKtt relates this verse, and so Hr in 
the Ghareebeyn: but ISk, thus: csk J] cs-k Vi 
k4 j [and so I find it in one copy of the S:] and IJ 
explains it by saying that k4 j i_s k originally 
denotes the case of a woman who, when some 
one honourable in her estimation has been 
smitten, or wounded, takes a pair of sandals, and 
beats with them her head, and wounds or 
scratches it, and shaves off her hair; and the poet 
means, my people have come to the condition 
of wounded, or scratched, and shaven, women. 
(TA.) [Fei says,] Ik j <1 44 is a form of 
imprecation, meaning May God afflict him with 
pain in his 34 [or fauces], and wound his body:

also, the people of settled habitations make it to 
grow in their gardens, and water it and sustain it 
so that it does not dry up in the time when the

also said in the Minhaj that it is both wild and 
growing in gardens; that the wild is called i3^,

in all of this there is not acidity: the garden-kind 
resembles the cAa* , and in this is acidity, and an 
excessive viscous moisture: the best is the acid,

for glandular swellings in the neck, so much so 
that it is said to do good to him who has these 
even when hung upon the neck: with vinegar, 
also, it is good for the mange, or scab; and it is 
astringent; and puts a stop to malacia [so I

not hurt. (TA.) — Also What is in the interior of

to an Arab stung by a scorpion in four places, 
being said to have cured him on the spot: 
that which is plucked green relaxes [the bowels] 
excessively, and produces excessive vomiting: so 
in the “ Kanoon: ” (TA:) it is also beneficial for 
the tooth-ache, by fumigating with its seeds; and 
for killing fleas, by sprinkling what is cooked 
thereof; and for the sciatica, by rubbing with 
what is green thereof: (K, TA:) its root is cooked 
with vinegar, and one rinses the mouth with it for 
the tooth-ache; and the vinegar is cooked in it in 
hot ashes: when cooked in olive-oil, that oil, 
being dropped [into the ear-hole], is beneficial 
for ringing in the ears: it is beneficial also for the 
moist and flatulent colic: and sometimes 

it attenuates the blood: administered as a 
suppository in the vagina, it kills the foetus: (TA:) 
when the plant hears a single fruit, this is 
very deadly. (K, TA.) [See also 4 h*.] Accord, to 
[many of] the leading authorities among the 
Arabs, (TA,) the u in this word is 

augmentative; (Msh, TA;) because of their 
saying, meaning “ the camel became 

sick from eating Jklk; ” and J and Sgh [and Fei 
and others] have mentioned it in art. Jlk: but 
ISd says that this is not an evidence of its being 
radically triliteral; and that Jkk is like k>— = (as

quadriliteral. (TA.) 1 kk, aor. ^kk, (K,) inf.

signifies also A right state or condition or 
tendency; and accord, to the former, the epithet 
i ■ — iik.' is applied to him who has a wry leg, or 
foot, only by way of presaging a right state: hut 
Er-Raghib explains kk better, as signifying an 
inclining, from error, to a right state or tendency.

persons of the persuasion of Aboo-Haneefeh

Ignorance held nothing of the religion of 
Abraham except circumcision and that 
pilgrimage: accord, to Ez-Zejjajee, it was 

applied in the Time of Ignorance to him who

means [And verily the last abode is] the abode of 
everlasting life: (TA:) or u 1 here means 
the life that will not be followed by death: or 
much life; like as iPp signifies much death: 
(Msb:) and it is also the name of a 
certain fountain in Paradise, [the water of] which 
touches nothing but it lives, by permission of 
God. (TA.) <Gill »j*Gll, accord, to I'Ab, 
explaining xvi. 99 of the Kur, (TA,) means Lawful 
means of subsistence (K, TA) in the present 
world: (TA:) or Paradise. (K, TA.) — — Also 
(assumed tropical:) Advantage, or profit; or a 
cause, or means, thereof: whence the saying, 
sUi. jbul There is not, in such a one, profit, nor 
good: and so it is said to mean in the Kur [ii. 
175], “ oA-^all ls® (assumed tropical:) 
[And there is to you, in retaliation, 
an advantage]: (TA:) or this means that the 
knowledge of the law of retaliation restrains from 
slaughter, and so is a cause of life to two persons; 
and because they used to slay one who was not 
the slayer, retaliation upon the slayer is a cause of 
saving the lives of the rest: or the meaning is life 
in the world to come; for when the slayer 
has suffered retaliation in the present world, he is 
not punished for his act in the world to come. 

(Bd.) pAill lip means (assumed tropical:) 

The remaining of the light and whiteness of the

the occurrence of two lS together is disliked: (Sb, 
TA:) Aboo-'Othman [El-Ma- zinee] holds the j to

not admissible, because it is asserted that there is 
no instance in the language of a word of which

pluralized; the pi. being aGa and GAG. (Mgh.) — 
— Also Continuance, or endurance; or endless,

so it is said to mean in the following verse of 
Zuheyr Ibn-Jenab ElKelbee; who was a [kind of] 
king among his people: JG U G&j <1 a!I Yl All la 
ejjall [And indeed everything that the young man 
has attained, I have attained it, except endless 
existence]: or, as some say, it here means security 
from death and from evils. (TA. [But 
more probably the meaning is that next 
following: for in the Mz, 49th £ p, where this 
verse is cited, but with CK ip in the place of lSjj, 
he is said to have been (not a king, but,) “ a 
nobleman. ” See also, respecting him, p. x. of my 
Preface.]) And (tropical:) Dominion, or kingship: 
(Fr, AA, S, Mgh, Msb, K, &c.:) because the people 
of the Time of Ignorance used to greet kings [or 
rather those of Himyer] by the saying G*- 11 Alii, 
which they addressed to none other than a king; 
so that when any one of them became a king, it 
was said of him, <Ga 1I JG jMa [meaning (tropical:) 
Such a one has attained the kingship]. (Mgh: in 
which, and in the S, the foregoing verse is cited as 
an ex. of this last meaning.) <H aGAII means 
Endless existence belongs to God: (Lth, Msb, 
TA:) or dominion, or kingship: (Lth, Yaakoob, S, 
Msb, TA:) or freedom, or security, from all evils, 
(Khalid Ibn-Yezeed, AHeyth,) and from all causes 
of the cessation of existence: (AHeyth:) or 
endless existence, and security from evils, and 
dominion, and the like: (Fr:) or the expressions 
[of praise] that indicate and imply the ascription 
of dominion and endless existence: (Kt:) or 
salutations and benedictions are Gods, and at his

Mughnee,) because it does not [regularly] occur 
otherwise than prefixed to a proposition, (S,) for 
the being prefixed to a proposition is like the not 
being prefixed to anything, as the consequence of 
being prefixed, which is the sign of the gen. case, 
is not apparent: (Mughnee:) and (S, 

Mughnee, K,) also indecl., (S,) with fet-h, (S, 
Mughnee,) to render the pronunciation more 
easy, (Mughnee,) because damm with u is 
deemed difficult to pronounce: (S:) and 4nk, 
(Mughnee, K,) with kesr, accord, to the general 
rule observed to prevent the concurrence of two 
quiescent letters: (Mughnee:) and in like 

manner, '-‘j*- and ykjp- and ykj^: (Mughnee, TA:) 
of which forms, is asserted to be the original; 
(L;) though is more chaste than djjk, and is 
the form used in the Kur-an: (Az and TA in 
art. dj >=>•:) but some of the Arabs make y-p^. deck: 
(Mughnee:) it is an adverbial noun of place, (S, 
Msb,) a vague adverbial noun of place, 
(L,) [signifying Where,] like ue- with respect to 
time: (S, K:) or it is a denotative of place, by 
general consent: but accord, to Akh it 

sometimes occurs as denoting time, [signifying 
when,] as in the following verse, (Mughnee, TA,) 
which is the strongest evidence of its use in this 
sense: (TA:) jAi ^ i J11 i^U ji*2 fiiLS uSk- 
jlijVI [whenever thou shalt pursue a right 
course, God will decree thee success in the time 


to come]: (Mughnee, TA:) but in most instances 
it occupies the place of an accus., as an adverbial 
noun of place; or of a gen., governed by Of, 
and sometimes by another prep., as in the saying 
(of Zuheyr, TA in art. p»-ks), pLjlkj cjali yk4- 
[At the place where Calamity, or Fate, has 
put down her saddle, i. e., made her abode]: and 
sometimes it occurs as an objective complement, 
as it is said to do in yyk. pic. I <111 [in the 

Kur vi. 124 ], i. e. God is knowing: He knows 
where to bestow his apostolic commissions; pi*j 
being suppressed, as implied by ficl; or fie I may 
be rendered by pile., and so may govern the 
accus. case. (Mughnee.) Accord, to rule, 
(Mughnee,) in every instance, (S, Mughnee,) it is 
prefixed to a proposition, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) 
nominal, or verbal, but in most cases the latter; 
(Mughnee;) as in 4j fjSi [I will stand 

where Zeyd shall stand]; and uj^ uj & 
[Where thou shalt be, I will be]; (S;) and ykldk 
“IJI liij [1 sat where I saw Zeyd], the accus. 
case being preferred in an instance like 
this; (Mughnee;) and ckki dklk kAil [Go thou 
whither thou wilt.] (Msb in art. uj=>-.) You should 
not say 4 j [alone]: (S:) or it occurs prefixed 

to a single word in poetry; (Msb, Mughnee;) as in 
the saying, u^ fgpu-k ^ ps ’*^’ j 

pjUxll <y ykk. u-^ljkil [And we pierce them 
beneath the kidneys, after smiting them, with the 
sharp swords, where the turbans are wound]; 
(Mughnee;) but this is irregular; (Msb, 
Mughnee;) though Ks holds it to be regular. 
(Mughnee.) Lh relates, on the authority of Ks, 
that some make y-y^ to govern a noun in the gen. 
case, as in the saying, '-*11L duk u jj Ul [Seest 
thou not where Canopus is, rising?]: but he says 
that this is not of respectable authority: (L:) some 
write Jps-j cty^: and some, ykik, [which is the 
common reading, being an inchoative, and] 
the enunciative, p yp ji, being suppressed. 
(Mughnee.) Abu-l-Fet-h says that he who 
prefixes ‘-ky^. to a single word makes it declinable. 
(Mughnee.) [Accord, to Fei,] BenooTemeem 
say 'kyk when it occupies the place of an accus., 
as in the phrase, kjik. p 5 [Stand thou where 

Zeyd shall stand]. (Msb.) Ks says, I have heard 
among Benoo-Temeem, of Benoo-Yarbooa and 
Tuheiyeh, those who say ‘kyk in every case, when 
it occupies the place of a gen., and that of an 
accus., and that of a nom.; saying y^ up 

[Whence they know not], and 14*211 yyk. [where 
we met]: and he says also, I have heard some of 
Benu-l-Harithlbn-Asad-Ibn-El-Harith-Ibn- 
Thaalabeh, and all Benoo-Fak’as, say njk when it 
occupies the place of a gen., and djjk when it 


occupies the place of an accus.; saying V Hjk 
0 and 4“l yjp^. (L.) Sometimes the 
proposition after y-y^ commences with u], 
as in u4-k I jj j u! y^ o4p! [Sit thou where Zeyd is 
sitting]. (K in art. ul and IAk p. 92 .) — — It 
sometimes comprises the meanings of 

two adverbial nouns of place, as when you 
say, pjlS Sj 2c.ll pill 4° kkk [Where' Abd-Allah is 

sitting, there Zeyd is standing]. (AHeyth, L.) 

The restrictive ^ U) U) is sometimes affixed to 
it, and in this case it implies a conditional 
meaning, [signifying Wherever, or wheresoever, 
and, accord, to Akh, whenever, or whensoever,] 
(Mughnee, TA,) and renders two verbs mejzoom, 
(Mughnee,) as in the saying, u4?f u^ki Ikjjk 
[Wherever thou shalt sit, I will sit], (S,) and in the 
first of the verses cited above: (Mughnee, TA:) it

meanings; namely, a time of unknown limit, and 
also, as in the Kur xiv. 30, six months: (Fr, Msb:) 
accord, to Er-Raghib, the time of a thing's 
arriving, or coming, and happening; having a 
vague meaning, and rendered particular, or 
special, by that to which it is prefixed: some say 
that it occurs applied in different ways: to an 
appointed term; as that to which God makes one 
to live: and a year; as in the Kur xiv. 30: and to 
the time when an event takes place; as in the Kur 
xxx. 16: and to time absolutely: accord, to El- 
Munawee, in the [genuine] language of 
the Arabs, it is applied to [the time of] a glance of

substituting for it lS. (TA.) Sometimes, also, 

they prefix cii to (S, TA;) and say V

the pP- [or signet] upon it: (Mgh:) namely, a 
thing, (S, Mgh,) or a writing or book and the like: 
and “'jt 4*- signifies the same [or he put a seal, or 
the impression of a signet, upon it]. (Msb.) 
Accord, to Er-Raghib, pi and signify The 
impressing a thing with the engraving of the 
signet and stamp: and the former [as is indicated, 
but not plainly expressed, as distinguished from 
the latter,] is tropically used, sometimes, 
as meaning the securing oneself from a thing, 
and protecting [oneself] from it; in consideration 
of protection by means of sealing upon writings 
and doors: and sometimes as meaning the 
producing an impression, or effect, upon a thing 
from another thing; in consideration of the 
impress produced [by the signet]: and sometimes 
it is used as relating to (assumed tropical:) the 
reaching the end [of a thing]: (TA:) or 

the primary signification of is the act of 
covering over [a thing]: (Az, TA:) accord, to Zj, 
the proper meaning of pa and pa is the 
covering over a thing, and securing oneself from 
a thing's entering it: some say that the former 
signifies the concealing a notification of a thing, 
[as] by putting one's fingers over it, by way of 

guarding oneself thereby. (TA.) Hence, pi 

[The sealing of the testimony]; which 
is thus described by El-Hulwanee: the witness, 
when he wrote his name upon a [q. v.], 
caused his written name to he beneath a piece of 
lead, [i. e. covered it with a piece of lead,] and put 
upon it the impress of his signet, in order that 
there might he no falsification of it 

or substitution for it. (Mgh.) As to i fji- 

[The sealing of the necks], the case is related, in 
the “Risaleh Yoosufeeyeh,” to have heen this: 
'Omar sent Ibn-Honeyf to seal the £ [or 
unbelievers] of the Sawad; and he sealed five 
hundred thousand of them, in classes; that is, he 
marked them twelve dirhems, and twenty-four, 
and forty-eight; tying a thong upon the neck of 
each, and putting upon the knot a seal of 


t 

lead. (Mgh.) — — pi also signifies The 
protecting what is in a writing by marking [or 
stamping] a piece of clay [upon it, or by means of 

a seal of any kind]. (TA.) And you say, of a 

man, ’pp *4^ pi [He sealed his door against 
thee]; meaning (tropical:) he turned away from 

thee, avoided thee, or shunned thee. (TA.) 

And iHI pa. [He sealed for thee his door]; 
meaning (tropical:) he preferred thee to 
others. (TA.) — — •pP Jc. pi. [which may be 
rendered He sealed his heart] means (tropical:) 
he made him to be such that he understood not, 
and such that nothing proceeded from him; or he 
made his heart, or mind, to be such that it 
understood not, &c. (K, TA.) pfjjp <Ja <111 pi-, in 
the Kur [ii. 6 ], is like the phrase in the same [xvi. 
no and xlvii. 18 ] h-jP jc <il' pP: (TA:) it points 
to what God has made to be usually the case 
when a man has ended in believing what is false 
and in committing that which is forbidden, so 
that he turns not his face to the truth; this 
occasioning, as its result, his becoming inured to 
the approval of acts of disobedience, so that he is 
as though this habit were impressed upon his 
heart: the assertion of ElJubbaee, that it means 
God hath put a seal upon their hearts, as a sign, 
to the angels, of their infidelity, is nought: (Er- 
Raghib, TA:) is explained by IAar as meaning 
the preventing of the heart from believing. (L in 

art. £-^.) [See also £jfy] pi, inf. n. pi, 

also signifies [as indicated above] (assumed

portion of the Kur-an; meaning he retained the 
whole of it in his memory. (Msb.) It is said of 
Suleyman El-Aamash, ijij CP, meaning

its admixture shall be musk: accord, to Ibn-

that when any one shall drink thereof, he will 
find the last cup thereof to have the odour of 
musk: Er-Raghib says that the meaning is, the

may imagine him to be a serpent: if the

length of the hole, and if it feel a serpent, it 
strikes it, and cuts it in halves; and if it he a 


hunter, it does not suffer him to lay hold upon its 
tail, and so it escapes, for the hunter does not 
dare to put his hand into its hole, because it may 
not be free from a scorpion, of which he fears the 
sting, as a strong friendship subsists between 
the and the scorpion, and the former makes 
use of the latter to defend itself from the hunter: 
or, as some say, it signifies its concealing itself, 
and remaining long in its hole, and seldom 
appearing, and being very cautious. (O,

half a drachm of the integument, with cold

forged a sword: (K:) or fashioned it with the file,

shoes and boots], (K,) who was of the people of 
El-Heereh, (TA,) for a pair of boots, until he 
angered him, (K,) and Honeyn desired to anger 
the Arab: (TA:) so when the Arab of the desert 
departed, Honeyn took one of his two boots and 
threw it down in the way, and then he threw 
down the other in another place; and when the 
Arab passed by one of them, he said, “How like is 
this to the boot of Honeyn ! and if the other were 
with it, I would take it: ” and he went on: and 
when he came to the other, he repented of having 
left the former: and Honeyn had lain in wait for 
him: therefore when the Arab went away in 
search of the former [boot], Honeyn betook 
himself to the camel that he rode, and what was 
upon it, and went away therewith; and the Arab 
came, having with him nothing but a pair of 
boots; and it was said, (K,) i. e. his people said to 
him, (TA,) “ What hast thou brought from thy 
journey? ” and he answered, 34 34 ,44. [“ I 
have brought you the two boots of Honeyn ”]: 
and this became a prov., applied on the occasion 
of one's despairing of an object of want, and 
returning disappointed: (K:) thus the case 
is related by A 'Obeyd, and by most others after 
him. (TA.) Accord, to ISk, Honeyn was a strong 
man, who asserted his relationship to Asad Ibn- 
Hashim Ibn-'Abd-Menaf, and came to 'Abd-El- 
Muttalib, wearing a pair of red boots, [formerly 
distinctive of kings and men of high rank,] 
and said, “O my paternal uncle, I am the son of 
Asad the son of Hashim the son of 'Abd-Menaf: ” 
but 'Abd-El-Muttalib said, “ No, by the garments 
of my father Hashim, I know not in thee the 
natural qualities of Hashim; therefore return 
thou: ” so he returned: and it was said, u4-

(S, Mgh,) There shall be no putting together

Prophet made it incumbent on a person 
having possessed forty sheep or goats a whole 
year to give one sheep or goat; and so on one 
having possessed more thereof to the number of 
a hundred and twenty, to give one sheep or goat; 
but if they exceeded a hundred and twenty by 
one, two sheep or goats were to be given of them: 
(Az, TA:) i. e. there shall be no putting together 
what is separate; as, for instance, when three 
persons possess a hundred and twenty sheep 
or goats, every one of them having forty, they not 
having been partners for a whole year, and it 
being incumbent on every one of them to give 
a sheep or goat; and when the collector of the 
poorrate comes to them, they put them together, 
assigning them to one pastor, in order that 
they may not be obliged to give for them more 
than one sheep or goat: (K, * TA:) accord, to IAth, 
this is termed 3=ilkl [app. a mistake for 3=itk] ; 
nor shall there be any separating of what is put 
together; i. e., when there are two partners, each 
of them having a hundred and one sheep or 



[BOOK I.] 

goats, for which together they are bound to give 
three sheep or goats; and when the collector of 
the poorrate comes to them, they separate their 
sheep or goats, so that each of them shall not 
have to give more than one sheep or goat: [see

man's mixing his sheep or goats when they are 
eighty in number with those of another which are 
forty in number, both together being bound to 
give two sheep or goats while they are separate,

that the collector of the poor-rate may not take 
anything: (Mgh:) or is, when there 

are, between two partners, a hundred and twenty 
sheep or goats, one of them having eighty and the 
other forty, and the collector of the poor-rate has 
taken two of these sheep or goats, the former 
partner's restoring to the latter the third of a 
sheep or goat; so that the former has had to give 
a sheep or goat and a third; and the latter, two 
thirds of one: and if the collector have taken, 
from the hundred and twenty, one sheep or goat, 
the former partner's restoring to the latter one 
third [in some copies of the K, erroneously, two 
thirds] of a sheep or goat; so that the former has 
had to give two thirds of a sheep or goat; and 
the latter, one third of one: (ISd, K, * TA:)

and they give the poor-rate as two: (Esh-Shafi’ee, 
TA:) the trad, applies, for instance, to the case of 
two copartners who have mixed their property 
together; one of them having forty bulls or cows 
or of both kinds; and the other, thirty; and 
the collector of the poor-rates takes from the 
forty a [q. v.], and from the thirty a [q. 
v.]; then the giver of the makes a claim for 
restitution of three sevenths thereof upon his 
copartner; and the giver of the jjjj, of four 
sevenths thereof upon his copartner; for it is 
incumbent to give the beasts of these two ages 
[the and the £*>] when the property is not 
divided, as though it were the property of one: 
and the saying shows that if the collector of 
the poor-rate wrong one of them, and take from 
him more than the law imposes upon him, he 
cannot make a claim for restitution thereof upon 
his copartner, who is only responsible to him for 
the value of what falls upon him in particular, of

means a good son (K, TA) remaining after 
his father: (TA:) and the former, a bad son: (K,

Akh: some, he says, use the former; and some, 
the latter: but some say ‘-ilk 4 3^ and kill

man’s successor who is a substitute for him, 
good and bad: and is originally an inf. n.: (TA:)

remaining behind. (S.) It is said of Mohammad,

it is applied in this sense to a people, or company 
of men: (AZ, S, K:) and to beasts, or horses or the 
like, as meaning differing (K, TA) in their colours 
and appearances: (TA:) and gkk is applied to 
any two things that are different; (Ks, TA;) as also 
1 glsk: (Ks, Msb, TA:) and kk, (K,) or gkk, (Ks, 


TA,) to any two colours that are combined 
[because different]. (Ks, K, TA.) AZ cites, as an 
ex., the saying [of a rajiz], glak jljlS 4 kUsk [My 
two buckets are different, and their two suppliers 
with water]; (S, TA;) meaning that one of them [i. 
e. of the buckets] is ascending and full, and the 
other is descending and empty; or that one of 
them is new, and the other is old and worn out. 
(TA, in two places.) And one says of two children, 
or two male slaves; or two female slaves, that 
they are gkk, (Ks, K,) and 4 j'jk, (k,) 
applying to the male and the female, (TA,)

[BOOKI.] 


as stated above, pi. of ( -4^-: (IB, K, TA:) and 

a pi. of s-ilk. (TA.) ( -4lk.: see 3414, in three places. 

Also One who holds back from the place, or 

time, of promise: and one who breaks a promise. 

(TA.) And A woman that has let down her 

hair behind her. (JK, O, K.) And A woman 

that has attained to the period of one day, or two 
days, after her having brought forth. 
(IAar.) [Perhaps from the signification next 

following.] A she-camel in the second day 

after her having brought forth: pi. ^-4^. and — 4^: 
(K, TA:) these two pis. are mentioned in the K in 
different places in this art., but both are correct, 
like Ctj and 3“ j. (TA.) Hence, (TA,) one 
says, Va [He rode her on the second 

day after she had brought forth]. (K.) And 

The milk that is after the biestings: (AA, K:) pi. as 
above. (K.) One says also, 4))] ^-44k He drew 
from her the milk that came after the biestings 
had passed away. (JK.) And i 4134 uA 441, 

i. e. [Bring thou to us the milk of thy she-camel 
of the day] after the cessation of her biestings; i. 
e., of the milking that is after her bringing forth 
by a day or two days. (AA, TA.) — Applied to a 
garment, (S, K,) or a shirt, (Msb,) Having the 
middle, wornout part taken out, and the [cut] 
edges then sewed together: (S, Msb, K *:) and 
l signifies the same; (JK;) or a garment 

composed of two pieces sewed together: or, as 
some say, this signifies a garment pledged. (TA.) 

— Also, accord, to A 'Obeyd, The part beneath 
the armpit: and the lMj 14 of the camel are like 
the 0^4! of man: accord, to the S and the O, 444 
3441 signifies the two armpits of the she-camel 
(UU=jJ): but the author of the K, following the 
[first] explanation given by A 'Obeyd, says that 
this is wrong, and that the meaning is the parts 
beneath the two armpits of the she-camel. (TA.) 

— And A gap between two mountains, (JK,) or 
between two mountain-tops, (TA,) of little 
breadth and length: (JK, TA:) or a road 
between two mountains: (S, K:) or a valley 
between two mountains: (K:) or a place where 
water pours forth (K, TA) between two 
mountains, or between two valleys, passing 
thence into a wide tract: (TA:) and any road in 
a mountain, (Skr, K,) or behind a mountain, or 
behind a valley: (TA:) or simply a road; as also 
l 344i ; (JK, K;) this being either in a plain or in a 
mountain: (TA:) pi. of the former as above. (K.) 
One says y u'4' l i. e. [The hairy male hyena] of 
the road between two mountains, (S, K,) or of the 
valley between two mountains; (K) like as one 
says mj-. (S.) — And A sharp arrow: (AHn, 
K:) or, accord, to Skr, the word in this sense 


is ^-s4=s with the unpointed c; and this is 
more probably correct. (TA.) 34i4 : see 34k. 3illk 
inf. n. of -31k as meaning “ he was, or became, 
his 3414 ” [q. v.]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) — — 
[And hence, as a simple subst.. The office 
of 344..] 344 a successor: and a vice-agent, vice- 
gerent, lieutenant, substitute, proxy, or 
deputy: (KL:) one who has been made, or 
appointed, to take the place of him who has been 
before him: (JK:) an act. part. n. of -411, inf. 
n. ^-44 and 344; as also j 4y4 : (TA:) or it may 
have the meaning of an act. part. n. or that of a 
pass. part, n.: and so in the sense next 
following: (Msb:) the supreme, or greatest, ruler 
or sovereign, (S, Msb, K, TA,) who supplies the 
place of him who has been before him; 
(TA;) [particularly the successor of the Prophet; 
whence “ Caliph,” commonly used by English 
writers for “ Khaleefeh; ”] as also J. ^-44, (K,) 
which is the original form, (Msb,) without »; 
(Msb, TA;) disapproved by some, but mentioned 
by AHat and Ibn-' Abbad and IB, and occurring 
in a verse of Ows Ibn-Hajar cited by IB: (TA:) 
the » in the former is to denote intensiveness of 
signification, (Nh, Msb, TA,) as in 3k!>14 
and 3444 (Msb:) or, as some say, J4ll [i. e. for the 
transference of the word from the category of 
epithets to that of substs.]: (TA:) it is also 
said that the word may be an epithet of which the 
subst. qualified thereby is suppressed, for 
3444 but this requires consideration: (MF, TA:) 
it is an epithet applied to a man peculiarly: 
(Msb:) some make it fem.; (Fr, S, Msb, K;) 
saying 344 14, [This is another 

Khaleefeh]; though the proper way is to make it 
masc.: (Msb:) a poet says, 3j4i, 344 
JliSil 41b 344 Cuij [Thy father was a Khaleefeh, 
whom another Khaleefeh begat; and thou art a 
Khaleefeh: that is perfection]: (Fr, S:) the pi. 
is i_ajM4 [generally applied to any people that 
have succeeded others, and supplied their places, 
as in the Kur x. 15], (S, K,) like as is pi. 
of 3juj4 (S;) and 344 [generally applied 
to successors of the Prophet], (S, K,) because, as 
it applies only to the male, and has » added, the » 
is dropped in forming the pi., which is thus 
like 34 as pi. of (S:) thus says ISk, and 

the like is said in the O: but what AHat and Ibn- 
'Abbad say requires not this straining: (TA:) [i. 
e.] 4114 i s p], of 3444 and 344, of j ( --iu4 : (JK:) 
or some, having regard to the original, make the 
pi. to be i4L4 like as 34^4 is pi. of ^>3; (Msb;) 
and this pi. is masc. only, so that you 
say 344 3jMj : (isk, Msb, TA:) and some, having 
regard to the word itself [in its altered and used 


state], make the pi. to be 4114; (Msb;) and 

this pi. may have prefixed to it either a masc. or a 

fem. n. of number, so that you say 3 j14 

and 414; (ISk, Msb, TA;) both of which 

are chaste. (Msb.) You say, 434 4JI j 344 411 jlS 

[May God be to thee a supplier of the place of thy 

father]: (S, Msb: *) and in like manner you say, to 

a person, of any one whom he has lost by death, 

(S, Msb,) and who cannot be replaced; as the 

paternal uncle; (Msb;) or the mother. (K.) Some 

say that the application of the title 411 344 

[The Vicegerent of God] is not allowable, except 

to Adam and David because there is express 

authority in these instances [in the Kur ii. 28 

and xxxviii. 25]; but others allow it in other cases, 
1 . 1 , , 1 , . j 

like 411 and 411 j and 411 i_i ja. and 411 (£4; 

all of which have been heard: (Msb:) and Zj says 

that it is allowable to say of the Imams that 

they are 411 344 [The Vicegerents of God 

in his earth]. (TA.) 344; see the middle of the 

next paragraph. 41114.: see ( -44, in the former half 

of the paragraph. — — Also One who remains 

behind, or after, another, (Yz, K, TA,) or others, 

in the case of a war, or a warring and plundering 

expedition, and in other cases: (TA:) 

pi. u4!A (Yz, K, TA) and 4ill>4 which latter is 

extr. [in this case], but is also said to be a [reg.] 

pi. of [ 34114, and as such to signify persons 

who do not go forth on a warring, or warring and 

plundering, expedition: and 34)14 | ^ jlill signifies 

he who remains behind, or after, him who 

goes forth on such an expedition, being of his 

family. (TA.) 441411 in the Km - [ix. 84], 

means Then stay ye with those who 

remain behind. (Yz, K. *) 4ill j4 is also pi. of J, 3414 

[as fem. of 4414], (TA,) and signifies Women (K, 

TA) remaining behind in the houses or tents: 

but some assign to it the first of the meanings 

explained above: and some say that it means the 

children remaining behind. (TA.) It is said in 

the Kur [ix. 88 and 94 ], J, IjjjSj ch 1 

^4'44l, j. e. [They chose to be] with the women: 

(S, K: *) thus it is explained by Ibn-'Arafeh: 

but some say that the meaning is, with the bad, 

or corrupt, persons; and that <— 4* is here a pi. 

[of 4414,] like o-y'ja. (TA.) For — — 4414 is 

applied to a man [as meaning Bad, or corrupt]; 

and \ 3414 to a woman as meaning bad, or 

corrupt, and remaining behind in her abode: and 

the former to a slave as meaning bad, or corrupt: 

and also contrarious: and in this last sense it is 

likewise applied to a companion: and some of the 

grammarians say that there is no word of the 

measure l 1?4 having its pi. of the measure 

except 4414 and 4ilU and o* j4: but see this last: 



[BOOK I.] 

(TA:) and j "kk, also, has this last signification; 
(JK, TA;) or [rather] signifies very contrarious; 
(K;) as also J, <alk; (JK;) and so J, kk, and J, »kk ; 
(Lh, JK, K,) in each of which the u 
is augmentative, and each of which is applied to a 
man and to a woman and to a pi. number; (Lh, 
K;) hut kUiik has been mentioned as pi. 
[of sLak.], and as applied to males and females: 
(TA:) and is likewise used in this sense 

applied to a number of men. (JK.) — — Also, 
applied to a slave, [and app. to any man, but in 
this latter case I find it written ki, which I 
believe to be a mistranscription,] One who has 
withdrawn from the people of his house: so says 
Lh. (TA.) — — Also Stupid; foolish; or having 
little, or no, intellect or understanding; as also

or [ kik, (l,) or both, (JK,) likewise applied to a 
woman, as also J, <“k, (k,) or [ <“k: (JK:) or, as 
some say, klk signifies one in whom is no good: 
and, as also J, ^ilk, one who has not what suffices: 
or who often breaks his promises: (TA:) or both 
of these mean one who has not what suffices, and 
in whom is no good: or very contrarious. (JM.) 
One says that a man is klk J_ kk JaI and klk, J»l 
■'Ah, meaning The one in whom is no good, of 
the people of his house: (S, K:) and the 
ungenerous: (K:) or the stupid, or foolish: or the 
bad, or corrupt, and the evil: and it is [said to 
be] tropical. (TA.) And j fk Persons in 

whom is no good. (JK.) And, [app. because 

he leaves his family behind him,] A drawer of

mentioned in the K; but ikJI is there erroneously 
put for mfok' l. (TA.) — — And Weak, 

without appetite for food. (TA.) And Flesh- 

meat from which a slight smell is perceived, but 
in the chewing of which is no harm. (Lth, TA.) — 
See also kk. Aalk ; see kk, in the former half of 
the paragraph. Also, particularly, [or perhaps kl 
Aalk only in this sense,] A nation, people, or race, 
remaining after another that has gone before. 
(I 'Abbad, K.) And One who comes to the water 
after him who has returned [from it]: whence 
Aboo-Bekr applied this appellation to himself, 
from a motive of humility, when asked if he were 
the Khaleefeh of the Apostle of God. (IAth, TA.) 
See also klk, in eight places: and see its 
pi., kll^i., in the same paragraph, in two places.

explained in the K,] Very contrarious, or

says Ak an d l S', [or rather, I think, because 

used as a proper name, as MF, says, (though SM 
disputes this,) and with the sign of the fem. 
gender,] means I know not what one of mankind 
he is; (S, K;) as also Aiik ^ 1 , perfectly deck;

app. the latter,]) of a kk; and one says k kk 
(knilk [app. meaning a tent having two poles in 
its hinder part]: (TA:) the pi. is kllji.: (S, TA:) 
which is hence applied to the angles, or corners, 
of a kk : AZ says that the Alik of a k is [app. the 
shirt thereof,] beneath the [ropes called] J" 1 , in 
the [part called] jk£ [q. v .]; and it is also called

As. (TA.) Also A camel that has the sheath 

of his penis slit, and that will not remain 
stationary, by reason of pain: (TA:) and J, k

measure (j4i) for you, (Ksh, Bd,) and will form, 
(Bd,) of clay, a thing like the form of the bird, or

into being or existence, anything, not after the 
similitude of anything pre-existing: (TA:) [and 
the creating a thing; and thus it is generally best 
rendered; as meaning the bringing into existence

Mughnee, *) like that of ts-33 [used as a verb]: it

those who came to me were without Zeyd]: (S:) 
or correctly, accord, to IB, 1-4 j 53 [for 

fjj, like as you say, fj 3S53, for fj 33 53], 
(TA.) When you say 53 L>, it is followed only by 
an accus., because 5li. 3 is equivalent to an inf. 
n.; (S, Mughnee;) so that when you say, 

Ijjj 53 U [meaning as above], it is as if you 
said, 3j jli Lr’jj'-?- [or Ijjj Ij3], i. e. Jgj Of

[They came to me, they being without Zeyd]: (S, 
K:) [for] accord, to Seer, 53U occupies the place 
of a noun in the accus. as a denotative of state: 
but some say, as an adv. n. of time; so that, 
accord, to these, Ijjj 53 3 means 3j 3aj 

[in the time of their being without Zeyd].

tract of country or desert:] and then, particularly, 
such as one takes for the purpose of satisfying a 
want of nature; (MF, TA;) i. q. (S, Msb, K,) 

but not as meaning only a place for the 
performance of « > 3 jll ; as might be imagined 
from this explanation: pi. 43Li. (MF, TA.) It is

said in a prov., (S, Meyd,) 3331 (s, 

Meyd, K,) [in Freytag’s Arab. Prov., (i.

most preservative (f jl') [of thy sense of shame, or 
modesty]; meaning it is most fit for thee to be 
alone in thine abode; (S, * Meyd;) for he who 
is so needs not to be careful for his shame, or 
modesty: it is used in blaming the mixing with 
others. (Meyd.) »j53 33 [His place 

of retirement for satisfying a want of nature was 
straitened to him] is used as meaning he suffered 
suppression of the feces, or constipation of the

mentioned by Th, (TA,) meaning Verily he is 
good in speech. (JK, TA. [If the former reading be 
right, the meaning may be similar to that of J3*

belongs to art. and is tropical, from the 

herbage termed ^31 and this may also be the 
case if the former reading be right.]) and its 

fem. ^jfk: see J3-, in twelve places. The fem.

Loosed from the cord, or rope, with which her 
fore shank and her arm have been bound 
together, (S, Msb, K,) and left alone, or free, (S,) 
so that she pastures where she will. (Msb.) 
Hence, (Msb,) it is used by way of metonymy as 
meaning Divorced: (Lh, S, Msb, K:) one says to a 
woman, cjji Thou art divorced; (Lh, S;) and 
thus a man used to say in the Time of Ignorance: 
(TA:) and one says, ^ She is divorced: 
(Msb:) and a woman is divorced thereby when 
divorce is meant. (Lh, TA.) Applied to a woman, 
it signifies also Free from any obstacle to 

marriage: pi. ciililk. (Msb.) Also A she-camel 

that is made to affect, with another she-camel, 
one young one, so that both yield their milk to it, 
and to which the people of a tent, or house, 
confine themselves exclusively of the other for 
the purpose of milking her: (S:) or a she-camel 
that is chosen as the one more abundant in milk, 
when one has brought forth and her young one is 
drawn away (jts) as soon as born, before she 
smells it, and the young one of another, that has 
brought forth before her, is brought near to her, 
and she affects it; the other is left to suckle the 
young one, and is termed 3= pi.

left, or left alone, to be milked: (K:) or that affects 
a young one [not her own], or is destitute of her 
young one, (JK, M, K,) whether she incline to

of her young one by death or slaughter, (M, TA,) 
and whose milk one causes to flow by means of 
the young one of another; but only by her 
affecting a young one, and not suckling it: (M, K: 
*) or that brings forth, when abundant in milk, 
and has her young one drawn (3?3) from beneath 
her, and another put beneath her, and is 
then left, or left alone, to be milked; (Lh, K;) this 
being done because of her generous quality: (Lh:) 
or a she-camel, or two she-camels, to which the 
people of a tent, or house, confine themselves 
exclusively, for milking, when two or three she- 
camels are made to affect one young one, and to 
yield their milk to it; the young one [afterwards] 
sucking from one of them only: (K, * TA:) or a 
she-camel that brings forth, and whose young 
one is drawn away (3A0 in order that her milk 
may continue for their use, she being made to 
yield her milk by means of the young one 
of another, which is then withdrawn from her, 
and she is milked: sometimes, also, they bring 
together three and four LAA [pi. of Aik] to one 
young camel: and the doing so is termed LAX 
(IAar, TA:) in this case they take as a AA 
whichever of them they will. (ISh, TA.) [Applied 
to a she-camel in any of these senses, it seems to 
be an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is 
predominant; i. e., used without its 

having AU prefixed to it.] — See also the 

paragraph next following, in two places, AA [as 
fern, of the epithet ^A: see the next 

preceding paragraph, and the places there 
referred to in its first sentence. — As a subst. it

Mohammad Ibn-Ketheer says, This is a phrase 
known to us in ElYemen, where any other is 
scarcely ever used [in its stead]. (S.) [Wine:

(Mgh:) or it has a common application 
to intoxicating expressed juice of anything: (K, 
TA:) or any intoxicating thing, that clouds, or 
obscures, (lit. covers,) the intellect; as some say: 
(Mgh, * Msb: [but see what follows:]) and the 
general application is the more correct, 
because j**- was forbidden when there was not in 
El-Medeeneh any of grapes; the beverage of 
its inhabitants being prepared only from dates in 
their green and small state, or full-grown but 
unripe, or fresh and ripe, or dried: (K, * TA:) or 
the arguing thus, from this fact alone, requires 
consideration: (MF:) AHn says, it is (assumed 
tropical:) sometimes prepared from grains: but 
ISd holds this to be an improper signification: 
(TA:) it is also sometimes applied to the 
(assumed tropical:) beverage called 44, like 
as is sometimes applied to wine expressed 
from grapes: (L in art. 4k) applied to (tropical:) 
expressed juice from which [properly so 
called] is made, [i. e., to must, or 

unfermented 44,] it is tropical: it is so used in a 
trad, in which is said to have been sold by [a 
companion of Mohammad named] Samurah: 

[in its proper acceptation] is so called because it 
veils i. e. the intellect: (K:) or because 
it infects (jk-H i. e. -4111^) the intellect: (S, K:) 
[as though acting like leaven: (see 1:)] so said 
'Omar: (TA:) or because it is left until it has 
become mature [and fermented]; (K;) or until its 
odour has changed: (IAar, S:) [see 8:] the proper 
application of the root is to denote “ covering,” 
and “ commingling in a hidden manner: ” (Sgh, 
Er-Raghib, TA:) it is of the fem. gender, and 
sometimes masc.: (Msb, K:) you say 3* as

the correct explanation, accord, to Aboo-Sahl El- 
Khowlee; and Aboo-Zekereeya says the like; 
(TA;) or their pasturing three days, and coming 
to the water on the fourth day [not counting the 
day of the next preceding watering; for it is 
evident that this explanation is virtually the same 
as that preceding]: (S, K:) accord, to Lth, the 
drinking of camels on the fourth day, counting 
the day on which they returned from [the next 
preceding] watering; but Az says, that this is a 
mistake; the day of returning from watering not 
being counted [when it is explained as meaning 
the drinking on the fourth day]: (TA:) pi. 
the only pi. form. (Sb, TA.) [See cfA.] Hence, 

[as in copies of the K, or it may be A4- s ^,] 
A desert in which the water is far distant, so that 
the camels come to the water on the fourth day, 
exclusive of the [next preceding] day on 
which they drank. (Az, K, TA.) Hence also the 
saying, AAV AUA A= j (s, K *) (tropical:) 

Such a one makes a pretence of AA [or fifth- 
day waterings] for the purpose of A A [or sixth- 
day waterings]: i. e., he advances his camels from 
the to the A^: (K:) a prov.: (TA:) meaning, 
such a one strives to deceive, or circumvent: (S, 
K:) applied to him who acts towards another with 
artifice, pretending that he obeys him, or 
complies with his desire: (TA:) or to him who 
pretends one thing while he means another: (K:) 
and taken from the saying, related by AO and 
IAar, AAV UAA [He made a pretence 

of A-A for the purpose of A-A]; said of him 
who proposes a thing whereby he means 
another thing, which he commences and by slow 
degrees accomplishes: (TA:) for a man, when he 
desires to make a long journey, accustoms his 
camels to drink AA Aii. [i. e. on the fifth day 
and then on the sixth, in each case counting the 
day of the next preceding drinking as the first]: 
(K, TA:) the origin of the saying, accord, to IAar, 
being this: an old man was among his camels, 
accompanied by his sons, men, who pastured 
them, and who had been long far distant from 
their families; and he told them one day to 
pasture their camels Aj [i. e. watering on the 
fourth day, counting the day of the next 
preceding watering as the first], which they did, 
proceeding in the way towards their families: 
then they proposed to do so AAk ; and then, AA : 
whereupon the old man, understanding what 
they meant, said, ye are doing nothing but 
making a pretence of A-A for the purpose 
of A A; the object of your desire is not the 
pasturing of them, but it is only your families. 
(TA.) [See below, voce A^, a saying similar in 

words but different in meaning.] It is also 

used for A**- A [A journey in which the camels 


are watered only on the first and fifth days; a 
journey in which the second and third and fourth 
days are without water]. (L in art. A.) You 
say iAAj [and AU. 4-=,] and 

and [and AA-Ak, &c.,] i. e. A journey [in 

which the camels are watered only on the first 
and fifth days,] in the course of which, to the 
water, there is no flagging, by reason of its 
remoteness. (TA.) El-’Ajjaj uses the 

expression a-A' I JAS A*?. meaning, A 

[journey of the kind termed] without 

any deviation, like a rope made of hair that has 
fallen off and that is free from any unevenness. 
(L, TA.) — — A=“- also signifies The fifth 

young one, or offspring. (A in art. AE.) — A 
[garment of the kind called] A, (S, K,) of the 
fabric of El-Yemen; (S;) so called because

signify one who affects languor, or languidness,

one uses the latter epithet only when he means 
one who does what is excessively foul, or

meaning often borne by the former also;] 
notwithstanding that AnjAi , as signifying the 
“committing such an action,” was unknown to

in their language: (MF, TA:) [often, also,] the

what is desired in all circumstances and by every

second of these instances it is thus called to imply 
the meaning of wealth, or property, that has been 
collected in a praiseworthy manner, or it 
means much wealth or property; and this is its 
meaning in the first of the instances mentioned 
above, agreeably with a trad, of 'Alee; and also 
in the Kur, c. 8: (TA:) [being used as a pi. (as well 
as a sing.), it may be also rendered good things:] 
and it is also used by the Arabs to signify horses; 
(K, * TA;) and has this meaning in the Kur, 
xxxviii. 31: (TA:) [it is often best rendered good 
fortune; prosperity; welfare; wellbeing; weal; 
happiness; or a good state or condition: and 
sometimes bounty, or beneficence.] j4JI JJa 34-3

(TA in art. or [who does no good;] who is 

not near to doing good; denoting the 
nonexistence of good in him. (Msb in 
art. J3.) [Thus it sometimes means the same 
as 34 V 343 A man in whom is no good or 
goodness; devoid of goodness; worthless.] And

not [there] mean by it [the comparative or

woman, signifies generous in race, exalted in 
rank or quality or reputation, goodly in face, good 
in disposition, possessing much wealth, who, if 
she bring forth, brings forth a generous 
child: (TA:) [4 3*4 is also applied as an epithet to
