44. 1:1 [1], Arabic: rahman - generally translated most merciful and synonyms thereof. This is understandable given modern 
usage of the word and the fact that it shares the r-h-m root with rahim. However, there are three cases to be made against 
such a Qur'anic value for rahman. Firstly, there are many Qur'anic instances where context and usage are at direct odds with 
the subject of mercy. Secondly, rahman appears alongside rahim in the bismillah which would be - were the Traditionalist 
right in his assessment of rahman - tautologous (whereas the text in general is characterised by great economy words and 
exactitude). Thirdly, there is hard historical evidence of usage of rahman among Nabataean Arabs in the sense of almighty 
(specifically, in the context of a eulogy to a king who had just defeated and laid waste his enemies). That rahman was used in 
this sense among the Nabataeans lends additional supports to the broader thesis that Muhammad was a Nabataean Arab - 
perhaps from Petra, but certainly with access to it as a place of pilgrimage (see Article XVIII). The rendering of rahman as 
almighty is based upon pan-textual comparison of all instances. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. See 
36:23 and Article I. 

45. 1:1 [1], Whatever else al fatihah may be, its primary function is as a contract between lord and vassal. Interestingly, its 
contents and structure mirror to a noticeable extent suzerainty treaties used by the Hittites - whose kingdom at one point 
buttressed the city of Petra - where I and others place al masjid al haram (see Article XVIII). The articles of the contract are 
tersely stated, but are present for all that, with rights and responsibilities clearly listed on both sides. By treating the Qur'an 
as a complete document - and given my understanding that alfatihah represents a contract - it was natural to look in what 
follows alfatihah for what is common to all contracts: clarification of the key terms used by the broader document - and this 
is what one finds. It is helpful to think of alfatihah as the believer's pledge of allegiance. See Article XI.i. 

46. 1:2 [2], Arabic: ' alamin. This denotes 'worlds’ - i.e. all places that can or do exist - or the inhabitants thereof. Since we have to 
choose a value for the text, given that I work according to a methodology where clearly demonstrable values are taken over 
those which have a measure of ambiguity, I have opted for 'all mankind' since that is clearly the sense at 2:47, 2:122, 3:33, 
etc. 

47. 1:3 [1], Arabic: rahman. Typically rendered most merciful. See 36:23, note to 1:1 and Article I. 

48. 1:4 [1], Arabic; din. See Article VII. For Day of Judgment see 82:17-19. 

49. 1:5 [1], Tenses are often indistinguishable in Arabic. The future tense, I believe, is both implied and natural in English in a 

context where terms are agreed.

50. 1:5 [2]. This verse is of critical importance to the man who takes the Qur'an seriously since it represents his part of the 
contract he makes with God. 

51. 1:6 [1], See 6:151-153. 

52. 1:7 [2], Such people are those who either disobey or otherwise reject the truth after it comes to them (see 2:61, 2:112, 4:93, 
7:71, 8:16, 16:106, 20:81, 42:16, 48:6, 58:14).

54. 2:0 [1], Arabic: rahman. Typically rendered most merciful. See 36:23, note to 1:1 and Article I. 

55. 2:1 [1], Various single and combined letters precede certain chapters. In this work, where such letters precede a chapter, 
they are presented in a bottom corner of each page of that chapter. Traditionalist Islam has, in its 1,400-year history, 
furnished many theories as to their meaning, none of which is convincing and some of which are, frankly, silly and insulting 
to the intelligence. There is nothing wrong with ignorance if one is open and honest about it, and in the first e-book editions 
of this work I do not claim to understand what these letters - or muqatta'at as they are known - mean; having tried and 
failed to decipher them on more than one occasion, I had made peace with the fact that I would have to publish my life's 
work without an answer to this age-old question. However, as I was approaching the end of the process of correcting the text 
prior to the hardcopy release, I was privileged and humbled to gain a cohesive and convincing understanding of their 
meaning in response to prayer. The findings themselves (i.e. the logical workings and meanings which God decreed for the 
muqatta'at') are both demonstrable and - when understood - impressive. However, they are not something one can 
summarise in a few words; they require a certain level of intelligence possessed of the power of sustained concentration 
combined with an amount of effort. However, these factors being present, a full understanding of the muqatta'at may be 
gained in a few hours by the diligent student; and once gained, such an understanding will enhance that student's 
engagement with - and appreciation of - the Qur'an. In the footnotes, I provide the meaning of each set of muqatta'at, along 
with a reference to this note and to Article XX where the interested reader may acquaint himself with their detailed 
exposition.

mlm: Guide thou us to the straight path 

The path of those whom thou hast favoured 

Not of those who incur wrath 

Nor of those who go astray. (1:6-7) 

56. 2:2 [1], Arabic: dhalika. This demonstrative pronoun is commonly rendered at this juncture by Traditionalist translators as 
this (i.e. what follows). The non-sectarian A. J. Arberry distinguishes himself among mainstream translators in that he 
correctly renders dhalika that (i.e. what precedes). In this work the order of the Qur'an is taken to be as fixed and deliberate 
as that of its contents; thus dhalika points back at and references that which precedes; namely, the conjoined letters aliflam 
mim, and via them, alfatihah. The feminine equivalent of dhalika is tilka [that, those). 

57. 2:2 [1], Qur’anic definition: al kitabu Id rayba fi hi. This is how the Qur'an refers to what is commonly called al fatihah. 
Verses 1:1-7 comprise a suzerainty (or lord-vassal) treaty - defining obligations and rights between parties. This agreement 
comprises the quintessence of the Qur'an (the Qur'an states at 10:37 that the Qur'an itself serves two purposes: to confirm 
what is within its scope, and to give a detailed exposition of al kitabu la rayba fi hi). One of the senses of kitab is contract and 
synonyms thereof, and the present phrase is rendered here and throughout: the covenant about which there is no doubt. See 
10:37, 32:2 and Article XI.i.

58. 2:2 [2], Qur'anic definition: al muttaqun. Verse 2:3 describes al muttaqun - those possessed of taqwa-. those who act in the 
world on the basis of something they have not yet seen. The concept of taqwa is often translated as consciousness (of God) or 
piety. I agree with these renderings insofar as they carry the connotation of circumspection and precautionary, preparatory 
or anticipatory awareness; yet they are missing two key components: the fact that such fear is warranted (one's duty is a real 
and pre-existing obligation; see 7:172), and action based thereon (here: spending of everything which God gives) which is 
proof positive of that which is claimed. I render the verb: to be in prudent fear, the participle those of prudent fear, and the 
noun prudent fear throughout since this rendering achieves something of the two requirements just stated as well as the 
initial sense of fear or consciousness. The possession and exercise of taqwa is a core purpose of the human experience (2:21), 
and something peculiar to humans who, alone in all Creation so far as we know, are capable of conceptual anticipation and of 
planning and action on such a basis. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

59. 2:3 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

60. 2:3 [2], Arabic: aqama al salat. See Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve 

and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to 
which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 7:172). It may also 
denote worship since worship is a salat [duty). But just because worship is a duty does not mean that all duty is worship 
(just as, while all oranges are fruits, all fruits are not oranges - a simple point that evades the Traditionalist because he reads 
the Qur'an through the expectations implanted within him from haditiy he sees what he expects to find and twists or ignores 
what does not fit those expectations). 

61. 2:4 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

62. 2:4 [2], I.e. that of which the Qur'an treats which confirms (and generally corrects) previous scriptures. See note to 2:66. 

63. 2:4 [3], Arabic: yaqina. Generally translated as to be certain and synonyms, such values are acceptable but require 

clarification. There exists an unfortunate disconnect between Arabic and English here. In short, yaqina means two related 
things: to verify or confirm on the one hand and to be certain or sure on the other - depending on whether the idea is 
perfective. The two aspects are obviously related: having verified one is then certain. However, in the English of today such a 
relationship is not obvious. If to believe is fraught with difficulty in English (meaning today anything between to accept 
blindly and to be gullible on the one hand through to give purely intellectual assent to on the other) then to be certain to some

extent is an expansion or intensification of what to believe has come to mean. But yaqina is an evidence-based conviction; it 
is not a hope or a feeling - even an intense hope or feeling. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

64. 2:5 [2], See 2:5, 3:104, 7:8, 7:158, 9:88, 23:102, 24:51, 30:38, 31:5, 59:9, 64:16. 

65. 2:6 [1], Qur'anic definition: aUadhina kafaru. Typically rendered the unbelievers. The text immediately following provides 
the value for the discrete compound alladhlna kafaru. Those for whom [..Jit is the same[...] whether thou warnedst them or 
thou hast not warned them are, by definition, indifferent to warning. The definition applies only to aUadhina kafaru. 
According to the methodology used here since other compounds such as aUadhina kafaru + bi are not mentioned, they are 
not governed by this definition. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. See 2:257 and Article II.iv. 

66. 2:6 [4], Qur’anic usage: la yu'minun. The implicit value for this term is found in what follows at 2:7. This value may be 
summarised as: they are lost in darkness. Note that the definition applies to the discrete compound la yu'minun only. 
According to the methodology used here since other compounds such as la yu’minun + bi are not mentioned they are not 
governed by this definition. Qur'anic treatment throughout identifies belief as the acceptance of proof when presented. These 
who 'do not believe’ reject proof though it is compelling. In the first two editions I rendered this collocation explicitly as 'they 
are lost in darkness’ throughout. In this edition I have decided to revert to the standard reading but include this nuance of 
usage as a footnote in all cases. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. See Article Ii.ii. Cf. 36:10.

70. 2:12 [1], Arabic: aid. This word performs a range of functions depending on the mechanics of the sentence, but here it is 
operating as an intensifying interjection introducing a new sentence or thought which clarifies what went before. All 
instances in which aid performs this function are rendered in truth - which is a standard means of conveying its sense, 
although consistently applied in this work. This interjection is found at 2:12, 2:13, 2:214, 6:31, 6:62, 7:54, 7:131, 9:99,10:55,

76. 2:19 [3], Qur’anic definition: al kafirun. Typically rendered as the unbelievers, the rejecters or the infidels. Verses 2:8-20 
focus upon the single term al kafirun and - according to my analysis - define it. To claim al kafirun as unbelievers, rejecters or 
infidels as per the Traditionalist's contention may be right in a highly specialised sense, but that sense is now long lost. The 
Qur'anic definition restores and revives the term fully. Of the terms defined in the first pages of al baqarah it is al kafirun 
which is treated most comprehensively; perhaps because it is precisely this category of persons which is most pernicious 
and destructive. Verses 2:8-20, then, comprehensively fix the correct definition of al kafirun, which may be summarised 
(based on the Qur'anic treatment) as follows: 

• they claim to believe in God when they are not among those who truly believe 

• they try to deceive both God and those who do believe 

• they are themselves deceived

• they are diseased in heart 

• they create corruption in the earth while failing to see that they do so 

• they have contempt for the faith of the generality of mankind 

• they claim to believe and side with those who believe in God but, in fact, side with the shaytdns 

• they are in possession of guidance yet reject it in favour of error 

• they are blinded in darkness (due to the failure of the 'light' of their own making) 

• the full power and majesty of true light puts them in fear of death 

• their continued existence is by the grace of God alone 

The Traditionalist's value of rejecter or infidel here, again, is not spectacularly wrong, but it is still wrong - and sufficiently 
wrong to matter. What the Traditionalist means by al kafirun - and what he expects the reader to infer - is one who rejects 
the religion of Islam. That religion is not native to the Qur'an and God did not oblige men to follow the religion today known 
as Islam. He obliges them to follow guidance if they receive it (2:38). The entire point about al kafirun is that they are 
possessed of guidance; however, they are distinct from those who are indifferent to warning in that al kafirun claim to believe 
and claim to be guided. One of the Traditionalist's mistakes regarding this category of men is that he identifies al kafirun as 
an external group of deniers and rejecters. This is incorrect; this category of men is an internal group; an insidious force 
within. A point consistently missed but revealed by following the Qur'anic definition is that al kafirun see themselves as 
righteous. They speak the language of religion and faith. But they refuse to follow guidance. Something close in English 
would be self-righteous-, however, English is now degraded and this word has lost its primary meaning of one wise in his own 
conceits over the guidance of God and now means merely opinionated and moralistic, which is not what is meant here. In the 
popular sense, Pharisees is close to what we are looking for. The word hypocrites also bears consideration but is not fully 
correct. (A hypocrite is just a toady. He pretends to believe what he does not. But he may or may not consider himself 
righteous.) As defined by the Qur'an, al kafirun are very particular hypocrites - ones which both reject guidance and 
consider themselves virtuous. In short: al kafirun believe themselves followers of guidance, while following something else. 
All things considered, those who spurn guidance while claiming virtue is the shortest and simplest presentation of the core 
values this concept covers that I can offer, and I translate accordingly throughout where the word occurs as a discrete unit 
(taking no object), which is how it is found here. As the reader proceeds, he will see this definition of al kafirun and kafirun 
make resounding sense in contexts where the Traditionalist’s assumed value falls flat. See Article II. 

77. 2:21 [1], Qur'anic definition: lord. For moderns the word lord (Arabic: rabhj has lost its potency. However, we can refer to 

the Qur'anic definition of the word lord as it relates to God in order to regain a right relationship with it. As presented here, it 
indicates: 

• The one who created you and those before you

• The one who made the earth 'a carpet' (i.e. a flat surface upon which it is possible to live comfortably) 

• The one who made the sky 'a structure' 

• The one who sent down water from the sky (thereby ensuring life - since without water there can be no life) 

• The one who used that same water as a means to create provision (without which we would not survive) 

The Qur’an is clear: the one who did these things is your lord. I have not footnoted all instances of lord with references to this 
definition for reasons of economy of space (the word occurs 975 times). 

78. 2:21 [3], See note to 2:2. 

79. 2:22 [1], Qur’anic imagery concerning the surface of the earth consistently references a flat expanse. This conception stands 
in direct contradiction to popular philosophies which contend that the waters of the oceans are convex and held against the 
surface of a sphere by dint of a theoretical force nowhere demonstrated by empirical experiment (one which simultaneously 
magically opposes the proven centrifugal forces which would apply to a ball spinning at 1,000 miles per hour at its widest 
point - effects of which no-one can see or feel). Water has never been shown to lie at rest in any position other than flat. 
Railways, roads, canals, aircraft flight paths - i.e. those things men do in the real world - make no allowance for anything 
other than a flat surface. Opposed to what can be seen, measured and tested, we have claims which have much money, 
political will and philosophical bias behind them and which are promoted as fact to children before they have formed the 
ability to think, and which then receive much reinforcement in film and other media. Such assertions include Newton's 
famous thought experiment (i.e. interesting idea unproven in reality), Einstein's mathematical compositions (which are 
unproven hypotheses promoted today as fact) and NASA's grandiose claims (and questionable - sometimes laughable - CGI 
output). The best an intelligent individual can do in such circumstances is investigate and reflect upon such evidence as is 
around him relying upon his own experience and reason.

80. 2:22 [6], I.e. you know this to be the case [cf. 2:22, 2:42, 2:75, 2:146, 2:188, 3:70, 3:75, 3:78, 3:135, 8:27, 43:86, 58:14). 

81. 2:23 [2], Arabic: surah. This word indicates eminence or degree or step or exalted rank. Moreover, such degrees or steps exist 
only within an integrated system. However, the word surah has become synonymous with Qur'anic chapter by dint of usage, 
and is typically used today in that sense exclusively. I do not believe that to be the primary sense. My understanding, based 
on the totality of instances in the Qur'an (see 2:23, 9:64, 9:86, 9:124, 9:127, 10:38, 11:13, 24:1, 47:20, 47:20), is that the 
meaning of surah is akin to rule, order or teaching (that is, an ordinance - or system of ordinances - such as members of 
monasteries or other fraternities or communities might live under, which together guide those subject to its tenets towards 
predetermined goals). My view is that the challenge the Qur'an makes 'to bring a surah the like thereof relates to 
philosophical concerns. Man strives on the basis of his own inclinations to create social and political systems - from 
democracy to ‘Islam' to communism and libertarianism; the Qur'an's claim is that anything created by men will be inferior to 
that which God sent down. I leave the word untranslated throughout. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

82. 2:23 [3], Arabic: min diini - in place of, besides, to the exclusion of, outside of, excluding, in preference to, other than, not. The 
use of besides can be problematic in English in some contexts due to its connotation of in addition to (e.g. besides reading, I 
listen to music') whereas what is meant across Qur'anic usage is something entirely different to or separate from. I am forced 
to render min duni variously across the text by dint of what the English language will allow. However, in all cases the sense is 
that of exclusivity. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

Whose fuel is men and stones 85 


Prepared for those who spurn guidance while 
claiming virtue. 86 

25. And bear thou glad tidings to those who heed 
warning 87 

And do deeds of righteousness 


That they have gardens beneath which rivers 
flow 

(As often as they are provided with the fruit 
thereof they say: 

This is what was given us as provision before. 


And they are given thereby a likeness.) 88 


85. 2:24 [4], Stones are mentioned, in my opinion, since they represent the last refuge of vanity. Memory fades and metal 
corrodes: man hopes that he will live on through his buildings and his monuments. 

86. 2:24 [5]. Arabic: al kdfirun. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. This is one of the many places where 
the Traditionalist's preferred values for al kdfirun (such as unbelievers or infidels ) make no sense. It is also interesting to note 
that Rabbinic Judaism has it that Musa received both the Torah and - to put it in Qur'anic parlance - 'the like thereof (what 
Rabbinic Jews call the oral Torah - on which basis, at least in part, they ignore what they have of the Torah). In the case of the 
Qur'anic revelation, it is the Traditionalist who - while claiming to follow the Qur'an - most conspicuously follows something 
entirely different, something which he takes to be 'the like thereof (see sunan Abu Dawud, book 40/4587) citing grounds 
which are at odds with the Qur'an itself. By virtue of the fact that he has indeed attempted - and failed - to produce 'a surah 
the like thereof, the Traditionalist invites comparisons with those described at 2:23-24. 

87. 2:25 [1], Arabic: aliadhma amanu. Typically rendered those who believe. See 2:257 and Article II.iv. 

88. 2:25 [6], Arabic: mutashdbih. Lit.: similar, resembling, by way of analogy or comparison; semblance. Muhammad Asad's 
comment on this point is interesting: [...(Various interpretations, some of them of an esoteric and highly speculative nature, 
have been given to this passage. For the manner in which I have translated it, I am indebted to Muhammad 'Abduh (in Manar 
1,232 f), who interprets the phrase, "It is this that in days of yore was granted to us as our sustenance" as meaning: "It is this 
that we have been promised during our life on earth as a requital for faith and righteous deeds." In other words, man's actions 
and attitudes in this world will be mirrored in their "fruits", or consequences, in the life to come - as has been expressed 
elsewhere in the Qur'an in the verses, "And he who shall have done an atom’s weight of good, shall behold it; and he who shall 
have done an atom's weight of evil, shall behold it" (99:7-8). As regards the reference to "spouses" in the next sentence, it is to be 
noted that the term zawj (of which azwaj is the plural) signifies either of the two components of a couple - that is, the male as

93. 2:27 [1], There exists an ambiguity: does the pledge itself belong to God or is it one which references God? Upon reviewing

which God gives to - and is taken up by - man. I take this to reference alfatihah, the pledge which God gives to and takes 
from men. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

94. 2:27 [1], I.e. after they have agreed to it.

atom, aether, light and spirit, which are themselves integrated and occupy the same physical space; 2. physical or 
metaphysical realms above this plane; 3. laws which inform the processes of life, such as the seven hermetical principles.

104. 2:34 [2], Typically identified with the shaytan. 

105. 2:34 [4], Arabic: al kafirun. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. Contrary to the Traditionalist's 
understanding (which requires al kafirun be rendered rejecters or disbelievers), nowhere does Iblls reject God or disbelieve in 
God. Iblls has face-to-face discussions with God (for example 7:16, 15:39). That Iblls spurns guidance while claiming virtue 
(which is the definition of al kafirun found in the Qur'an at 2:8-20 and the one followed here) is in perfect keeping both with 
the current context and all contexts which treat of Iblls. 

106. 2:35 [2], Grammar: dual. What is clear from the Arabic but lost without labouring the point in English is that Adam and his 
wife fell together. There is no sense in the Qur'an that Adam was a victim of his wife's guile. Rather, the Qur'an states that it 
was Adam who hearkened to the guile of the shaytan (20:120).

128. 2:43 [1], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense it 

is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

129. 2:43 [2], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

137. 2:47 [2]. At 2:49 there begins a series of thumbnail-sketch histories of the children of Isra'Il each of which is introduced by 
the Arabic conjunction wa idh [found at 2:49, 2:50, 2:51, 2:54, 2:55, 2:58, 2:60, 2:61, 2:63, 2:67, 2:72, 2:83, 2:84, 2:93). Each 
instance refers back to this statement at 2:47. To be clear: from the Qur'anic evidence, God did not prefer the children of 
Isra'Il 'above al mankind' for all time - although there will be those who will claim this verse outside of the broader context in 
support of that assumption. The summaries which follow recount very specific times and ways in which God favoured the 
children of Isra'Il, and how - as a rule - they spurned that favour. The Qur'anic position is the precise opposite of that 
claimed by Jewish supremacists; it is that there is no favouritism or special consideration with God on the Day of Judgment. 
All instances are identified throughout by footnotes and reference this verse. 

138. 2:48 [1], See note to 2:2. 

139. 2:48 [4], Muhammad Asad comments here: [..Jan obvious allusion to the Christian doctrine of vicarious redemption as well as 

to the Jewish idea that "the chosen people" - as the Jews considered themselves - would be exempt from punishment on the Day 
of Judgment. Both these ideas are categorically refuted in the Qur'an. 

140. 2:49 [1], I.e. And (remember my favour wherewith I favoured you) when)..]. Arabic: wa idh. This refers back to 2:47. 

141. 2:49 [1], Arabic: fir'awn. This word is rendered as a proper name under the Arabia Felix thesis and as a title of royalty (i.e. 

Pharaoh) under the Egypt-Palestine thesis. However, beyond either thesis, there is strong internal support for treating 
fir'awn as a proper name and not a title; firstly, house (at) is only found with proper names, never with titles (2:49, 2:50, 
2:248, 2:248, 3:11, 3:33, 3:33, 5:54, 7:130, 7:141, 8:52, 8:54, 8:54, 12:6, 14:6, 15:59, 15:61, 19:6, 27:56, 28:8, 34:13, 40:28, 
40:45, 40:46, 54:34, 54:41); secondly, fir'awn nowhere takes a definite article (cf. al ‘aziz or al malik). Were we not primed to 
think of fir'awn as a particular type of king, one would not assume it from the Qur'an's presentation of the word. All 
instances are footnoted and reference this verse. See Article XVIII.

word division throughout. It is found at 2:53, 2:185, 3:4, 8:29, 8:42, 21:48, 25:1. All instances are footnoted and reference

174. 2:66 [1], Lit: between its hands. This expression is often translated before it. Certainly, it has come to mean this over time - at 
least some of the time - but I reject it as the Qur'anic sense for the reason that it is inconsistent in terms of treatment and 
usage; the Traditionalist generally fails to translate it as per his common rendering in this particular context, for example. 
However, in all instances [2:66, 2:97, 2:255, 3:3, 3:50, 5:46, 5:46, 5:48, 6:92, 7:57,10:37,12:111, 19:64, 20:110, 21:28, 22:76,

something between a range or span, subject to or within a (set) remit either of time, power, access, or attention. Holding true 
to this source meaning, where it treats of time I render it o/(or at) its (his) time-, where it treats of power I render it under or 
in his (the) authority; where it treats of access I render it within its (his) grasp-, where it treats of attention or relevance I 
render it within its scope. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. The exceptions - if one can call them that since 
they prove the rule - are 7:17, 13:11, 36:9, 41:14, 41:42, 46:21, 72:27. There the convention is not bayna yad- as here but 
min bayniyad-. In these cases the meaning is physical or temporal and means before. However, this plain meaning (preceded 
by min ) has been both expanded and conflated with the proper meaning (not preceded by min ) which refers in all cases to 
something within a range or scope as discussed above. I include part of Muhammad Asad's comment regarding this 
expression for interest: Most of the commentators are of the opinion that ma bayna yadayhi - lit., "that which is between its 
hands" - denotesj...] "the revelations which came before it", i.e., before the Qur'an. This interpretation is not, however, entirely

convincing. Although there is not the least doubt that[...] the pronominal ma refers to earlier revelations, and particularly the 
Bible (as is evident from the parallel use of the above expression in other Qur'anic passages), the idiomatic phrase ma bayna 
yadayhi does not, in itself, mean "that which came before it" - i.e., in time - but, rather)...] "that which lies open before it". 
[,.]Now this, taken together (a) with the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur'an and since established by objective scholarship - 
that in the course of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to considerable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with the 
fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur'an differ from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to the conclusion that the 
"confirmation" of the latter by the Qur'an can refer only to the basic truths still discernible in the Bible, and not to its time- 
bound legislation or to its present text - in other words, a confirmation of whatever was extant of its basic teachings at the time 
of the revelation of the Qur'an: and it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses in this context as well as in 5:46 and 48 
or in 61:6 (where it refers to Jesus’ confirming the truth of "whatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of the Torah").

182. 2:73 [1], I.e. Strike it [the neck of a heifer] in some of them [cases of a killed soul]. Many interpretations of this verse exist, 
some highly subjective and fanciful. On the basis of my own investigations this statement connects most convincingly with 
Deut. 21:1-9 wherein is found the Mosaic law in a case of unresolved murder. The procedure given there is for the elders of 
the town nearest the location of the discovered corpse to strike off the head of a heifer at the site, state what facts are 
known - namely that they are not guilty - and wash their hands. The mention of the use of reason at the end of the verse 
here at 2:73 corresponds both to the use thereof by the elders at Deut. 21:1-9 and to the fact that God gives 'life to the dead’ 
and 'demonstrates his proofs’ to us thereby: just as cases of murder may be established and resolved by the application of 
evidence and reason, so the fact of our own death and life thereafter is established by the same means. While I do not accept

Muhammad Asad's view of this verse - and while I reject any reliance on hadith out of hand - he contributes an intelligent 
point and makes it well, and I include it for the broader perspective of the interested student: The phrase idribuhu bi-ba’diha 
can be literally translated as "strike him [or "it"] with something of her [or "it"]" - and this possibility has given rise to the 
fanciful assertion by many commentators that the children of Israel were commanded to strike the corpse of the murdered man 
with some of the flesh of the sacrificed cow, whereupon he was miraculously restored to life and pointed out his murderer! 
Neither the Qur’an, nor any saying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers the slightest warrant for this highly imaginative 
explanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quite apart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribahu has a masculine 
gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as "human being") is feminine in gender: from which it follows that the imperative 
idribuhu cannot possibly refer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit., "he struck") is very often used in a figurative or 
metonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expression daraba fi’l-ard ("he journeyed on earth"), or daraba ’sh-shay’ bi’sh-shay’ 
("he mixed one thing with another thing"), or daraba mathal ("he coined a similitude" or "propounded a parable" or "gave an 
illustration"), or ’ala darb wahid ("similarly applied" or "in the same manner"), or duribat ’alayhim adh-dhillah ("humiliation 
was imposed on them" or "applied to them"), and so forth. Taking all this into account, 1 am of the opinion that the imperative 
idribuhu occurring in the above Qur'anic passage must be translated as "apply it" or "this" (referring, in this context, to the 
principle of communal responsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha in ba’diha ("some of it"), it must necessarily relate to the 
nearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafs that has been murdered, or the act of murder itself about which (fiha) the 
community disagreed. Thus, the phrase idribuhu bi-ba’diha may be suitably rendered as "apply this [principle] to some of those 
[cases of unresolved murder]": for it is obvious that the principle of communal responsibility for murder by a person or persons 
unknown can be applied only to some and not to all such cases.

192. 2:79 [2], I.e. the law. 

193. 2:79 [2], This statement indicates some among the Jews in the first instance, but by extension applies to Christians and 
Muslims also. The Jews invented other sources - some of them vile in the extreme - which they attribute to God, and they 
lost the integrity of their original scriptures many centuries ago. Their creed today finds its orientation in the justification of 
a narrow (historically questionable) racial-supremacy cult, and hypocrisy and moral double standard - often no standard - 
made virtue. The Christians today have a patchwork religion made up of some genuine words of Isa intercut with the 
cosmology of Roman sun-worshipping pagans, the later theology of the creator of their religion (the usurper and cointelpro 
agent Paul), and in some cases a form of spiritism (often, I believe, actuated by means of the 'Sinner's Prayer' - a concept 
found nowhere in the Christian Bible) and one frequently mistaken by the recipient for the 'Holy Spirit 1 . The Muslims have 
preserved their book at least. However, Muslim organisations are controlled at the top by the same people who control the 
other religions, and what the laity follows in fact is writings no less garbled or corrupt than those of the Christians and the 
Jews. It is also true - and certainly accepted here - that righteous men and women exist in many such groups; the guidance 
of God being neither limited to any group nor precluded from it.

shown in this work to mean to give [what is conducive to) - or to pay [the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual

And we gave ‘Isa , 210 son of Maryam 211 clear 
evidence 

And strengthened him with the Spirit of 
Holiness. 

Is it not that whenever there came to you a

210. 2:87 [2], Typically identified with that Jesus crucified under Pilate in the Christian extension of the Egypt-Palestine thesis; 
seen as a separate figure, the founder of the sect of the Nazarenes, and predating by a number of centuries [though latterly 
conflated with) the central figure of modern Christology under certain aspects of the ‘Aslr-Hejaz thesis, and as the son of 
Maryam, daughter of ‘Imran, sister of Musa within strands of thought associated with that thesis and with the Arabia Felix 
thesis. At the very least, one cannot but notice that the first reference to ‘Isa comes directly after mention of Musa. See 
Articles XVIII and XXI. 

211. 2:87 [2], Typically identified with the Mary of the dominant Christian extension of the Egypt-Palestine thesis; emerges as an 
entirely different figure who lived centuries prior under the ‘Asfr-Hejaz thesis, and as the sister of Musa under aspects of the 
Arabia Felix thesis. See Articles XVIII and XXI. 

212. 2:88 [2], Arabic: bal. This particle defies wholesale rendering into one form in English by virtue of the range of functions it 
performs. Lane has an excellent entry (p. 3039) where he describes bal as primarily a particle of digression]...] it denotes 
emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation. His comments go into some depth and explore the 
functions this particle performs in various contexts, and I refer the interested reader to those. I have been guided by Lane in 
terms of his analysis but not his usage in all cases. He was writing for a different time and English has evolved since. 
However, by following Lane’s explanation of the particle's function we can present a vehicle in the modern language for it. 
The primary function of bal is to interrupt narrative by means of negation or confirmation and then to digress (i.e. clarify 
along a new tack). The problem many translators have is that they use nay - which performs only some portion of the total 
requirement. By clinging to it they put themselves in a position where there are trying, as it were, to play tennis with no 
forehand and from the baseline only. What is required is a set phrase which does what Lane states, namely: denotes 
emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation. The use of nay manages only the case of negation, and 
not always very well. What is needed is something equal to: be that as it may, the fact of the matter is]...]. Such a phrase 
performs the offices which Lane describes and can function equally in cases of negation or affirmation. The shortest route I 
know of in modern English to achieve this value is: the truth is:]...] which means 1. without a doubt: certainly and 2. in reality. 
This, then, is the default and commonest rendering of bal here. However, there exist also, as Lane explains, several discrete 
applications of this particle. I evaluate and render these on a case-by-case basis in the light of Lane's broader comments as: 
nay, yet or hut depending on the case. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

seeming men is not in question; what is in question is their living up to what one expects of men (i.e. to show that they are 
men in fact). Qur'anic usage is the same, and it is worth the risk of burdening the reader with archaic usage to ensure that 
access to the underlying notion of praxis remains (i.e. the application of faith in deeds rather than mere verbal assent). All

UjI i J 

And they 250 taught no-one until they 251 had said: 
We are but a means of denial 252 so deny thou 



not. 253 


247. 2:102 [4], Arabic: sihr - sorcery. Where this word and others based on the same root occur in the text the sense is of 
something repugnant to the laws of 'nature'; to something fantastical, unnatural and unhinged (often in a dark way) from 
any right sense of what is real; thus, the work of those who practice dark arts is sorcery. But among the accusations levelled 
against messengers by those who reject revelation is that of sorcery (see examples at 10:2, 11:7, 28:48, 37:15, 38:4, 43:30, 
46:7). In this second case, the word seems often to indicate something closer to delusional or irrational in modern English. 
All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

248. 2:102 [5], Read both as two kings and as two angels (the difference in the diacritic marking is minimal) I have opted for the 
former reading since it says what was send down upon and not what was sent down by or with. However, I have no other 
information on this. Genuine, non-sectarian information on Hartit and Martit is elusive. If you can provide some, please let 
me know. 

249. 2:102 [5], Arabic: bdbil. Taken to be ancient Babylon, not the Babylon of the later Neo-Babylonian period. Sumer was the first 
so-called civilisation. It appeared, apparently from nowhere, with finances, taxation, religion, administration, and writing - 
that is, an entire control mechanism - in place. That matrix of centralised control was the forerunner of that system of 
control which goes by the name of civilisation today. 

250. 2:102 [6], Grammar: dual. 

251. 2:102 [6], Grammar: dual. 

252. 2:102 [6], Qur’anic usage: fitnah. This word has a range of dictionary definitions: trial; temptation; charm, seduction; 
sedition. Where a word has developed a range of senses, invariably those senses have emerged from a single core concept. 
The Traditionalist translator tends simply to pick whatever best suits the purposes of trying to create a connection between 
his religion and the contents of the Qur'an. Such an approach is unsatisfactory and, frankly, dishonest. Our task should be to 
uncover what the Qur'an means by the term and then to apply it consistently. With this in mind, at 2:102 we have the first 
use of fitnah. The usage indicates an obvious relationship between temptation and trial on the one hand and denial of faith 
on the other. The broader context of the local narrative confirms this. Earlier in the verse we are told Sulayman '[..Jdenied 
not but the shaytans denied’. At the end of the verse we find that such persons have individually sold their souls with 
cognisance of the consequences of their actions. The total context thus treats of denial of God (a damnable offence which 
sends one to Hell). To return to Hartit and Martit: what learning from them represents is a means of denial (of God). If we 
accept this as the root sense, it is easy to see that the other senses ( testing, trial; temptation; charm, seduction; sedition ) 
relate to this core and - I infer - have grown out of it. I render in accordance with the root sense identified here of means of 
denial in ah instances of the noun, and where the transitive verb occurs as to subject to means of denial. Ah instances are 
footnoted and reference this verse other than 5:49, 17:73, 51:13 which are rendered according to the requirements of their 
respective particular combinations of verb and preposition. 

253. 2:102 [6], When a man sells his soul he must understand that he bears personal responsibility for the contract; the shaytan 
needs a man’s permission to proceed - and that is what is occurring here. The aspirant must himself insist upon being given 
the knowledge he seeks from the hierophant so that the shaytan can - as he will - legitimately disown him on the Day of 
Judgment.

needed more details after they had been given clear instructions (which episode gives its name to the present chapter). As is 
widely known, the devil is in the details; that being the case, it should surprise no-one that Talmudism is an ideology 
founded on details based in the ‘wisdom' of the rabbis. The same is true of the primary foundational texts (i.e. hadith ) and 
standard legal process ( fiqh ) of the Sunni and Shia religions, which bear comparison with Talmudic practice. The Qur'an, for 
its part, gives some principles and a very few laws, and simply requires that we apply our own reason and not claim the 
specifics we develop on that basis to be from God and set in stone.

infidels or unbelievers. What the Traditionalist understands by kuffar is: those who reject the cult he himself follows (or those 
aspects of the other Abrahamic religions he admits as valid). What is meant in the Qur'an is: those entrenched in rejection of 
God and who are in fundamental and complete denial of their creator. The word in modern English which has ah those 
connotations is atheists (which is free of the specialist and arbitrary connotation the Traditionalist ascribes to it) and I

271. 2:109 [3], This is the response to the condition at 2:108. The point, in summary, being made here is this: 1. Only God guides 

(cf. 2:107). 2. If you want a high degree of specificity from God (2:108), then know that therein lies a danger of denial of God 
at the hands of many 'doctors of the law’, who want to return you to unbelief out of envy. The group ahl kitab is identified in 

the present work as any religious ruling class. At the time of the revelation it referred to those religious ruling classes 

connected with Judaic and Christian theologies only since no similar group had yet coalesced and appended itself to the 
Qur'an. Today, the situation is different. The arguments forwarded by the Christians and the Jews as the segment continues 
are made today - albeit in modified form - by their equivalents among those called Muslims. The point is, surely, that we are

to be wary of such people and to rely upon primary revelation and God alone. We are not to war against the doctors of the 
law as a class - we know there are some good men among them; rather, we are to 'forgive and forbear 1 . But, I would argue on 
the basis of my understanding of the Qur'an as a whole, that this does not mean we are to outsource our responsibility to 
learn and apply the Qur'an for ourselves to ‘experts'. We are to rely on God alone, and to be wary of those who - experience 
shows - frequently arrogate to themselves or to their specious sources that authority which belongs to God; we are to do our 
due diligence. 

272. 2:110 [1], Arabic: aqdma alsalat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

273. 2:110 [2], Arabic: atd al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation atd al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage); this value is based upon pan-textual

288. 2:114 [3], Arabic: wassa'd fi kharabiha is an idiom meaning to seek to undermine (something). Lit.: strive in its (their) 
destruction. The point here - missed, perhaps predictably, by the Traditionalist given his love for particularising the general - 
is that mcisjid (of which masajid is the plural] has the literal meaning of place of submission or place of worship and, as used in 
the Qur'an, defies exclusive - or even general - identification with what he means by mosque. The Traditionalist compounds 
this initial error with its unavoidable corollary at this point: the failure to grasp that the statement here serves as a 
counterpoint to what immediately precedes, which is that those who truly have ‘nothing to stand upon’ are those who 
undermine the places of worship of God (i.e. no matter what denomination they pertain to or who worships within them). 
The religion the Traditionalist conflates with the Qur'an is nowhere mentioned or indicated either here or anywhere else in 
the text; nor does it propose that any religion (in the sense in which a religionist means the term) has a monopoly - or any 
superior claim - on God (a point implicit in the statement at 2:115). We are judged on the quality and extent of our faith and 
works, not sectarian affiliations.

302. 2:120 [3], Religious creeds tend to coalesce around a notion of exceptionalism. Modern Christians are prolific and

today do not proselytise among non-Jews; yet they do require that non-Jews accede to the core assertion of their religion 
which is that Jews' abilities, sufferings, moral responsibility and destiny are exceptional. Those sects now called Islamic in 
their aggregate demonstrate most - if not all - the errors the Qur'an ascribes to the Jews and Christians whether it be 
abandoning revelation in favour of invented writings or exaggerating the place of a prophet and looking for external 
saviours. There is no implication anywhere that such people will not be rewarded for their merits and good works, naturally.

314. 2:125 [1], Arabic: wa idh. See note to the beginning of 2:124. 

315. 2:125 [1], Arabic: bayt - house, household. The Traditionalist has it that this is a reference to the box to which he bows in 
Makkah. I reject Makkah as a possible site of the pilgrimage referenced elsewhere in the Qur'an on the grounds of its 
inadmissibility historically, and on the basis of the Qur'an itself. Rather, I accept the evidence in favour of Petra as the site of 
al masjid al hardm (see Article XVIII). However, that original site - no matter where it once was - is now closed to those who 
hold to the Qur'an (see 9:28), so if a place of pilgrimage is what is referenced here, such can only be of historical interest 
today. We should also acknowledge the fact that the text at 2:125 simply says that God [...jmade the house a place of return for 
mankind and a place of safety [...] and that this statement remains true when stripped of all specific religious significance. 

316. 2:125 [2], Arabic: ittakhadha + min + object means to make something out of something. This construction is found at 3:140, 
4:89, 4;89, 7:74, 16:67 and 16:68 and in each case has the meaning just stated. This construction does not occur in the 
Qur'an with any other sense. 

317. 2:125 [2], Arabic: maqdm. This word occurs at 2:125, 3:97, 5:107, 10:71, 14:14, 17:79, 19:73, 26:58, 27:39, 37:164, 44:26, 
44:51, 55:46, 79:40 and means station and is rendered thus in all cases. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

318. 2:125 [2], Arabic: maqami ibrahim. This concept occurs twice: here and at 3:97. For the Traditionalist, it denotes a stone 
with two primitive footprints carved into its surface which functions as a piece of cultic theatre placed near his shrine in 
Makkah, a value I reject as an instance of obvious forgery and foolishness - one placed 1,000 kilometres from the site of al 
masjid al haram (i.e. Petra). See Article XVIII. 

319. 2:125 [2], Arabic: musalla. This is the only occurrence of this noun. The Traditionalist applies to this word the value of a 
place of prayer (and by prayer he means a ritual prayer found nowhere in the Qur'an). I am not prepared to accept this level 
of specificity in a case with no Qur'anic support. The facts we can support are these: musalla is a noun of place based on the 
s-l-w root, a root which I connect with complete consistency with the concept of duty and generically with the obligation to 
serve God alone (as per 1:5). The Traditionalist, on the other hand, applies his assumptions to that root selectively to gain 
the results he needs (see Article III). In this case, he regards musalla as a place of prayer at his shrine in Makkah. To me, the 
following two points seem reasonable precepts upon which to proceed: firstly, claims to certain, specialised knowledge of 
what musalla indicates should, given the absence of concrete data, be treated as spurious; secondly, it is irresponsible and 
intellectually dishonest to promote or accept theology based on the specific interpretation of ambiguous or unproven 
statements. Of course, it may be that musalla does in fact denote a place in the sanctuary which Ibrahim instituted; if it does, 
I cannot prove it Qur'anically - and nor can the Traditionalist. However, even if that still happens to be the case, I do know 
that the site of that sanctuary is not at Makkah; the evidence points to Petra, and that chapter of history is now closed, and 
was closed within the lifetime of the messenger (see 9:28). That taken as given, the imperative at this verse indicates an 
object which it is both impossible to know with certainty and impossible to implement. Alternatively, if the house in the 
preceding clause simply means the house a man creates with his family as a monotheistic unit (which is undoubtedly what 
2:125-141 treat of), then this is something we can adopt as a reasonable interpretation and apply to our lives. We can indeed 
aspire to the example of Ibrahim in our marriages; to create families in which monotheism alone is practiced and promoted, 
even at the expense of our comfort in the broader society. It would be irresponsible to claim this as a central point of

doctrine, and I do not do so. But since we know that the Traditionalist's cult is focused on the wrong location in any case 
(which invalidates all and any claims he may make for this and related verses) it is not unreasonable to make enquiry of the 
Qur'an on a logical and contextual basis even in those places where the Traditionalist's claims are both highly specific and 
objectively false. 

320. 2:125 [3], Typically identified with Old Testament Ishmael. 

321. 2:125 [4], Grammar: dual. The form II of the t-h-r root occurs 9 times: 2:125, 3:42, 5:6, 5:41, 8:11, 9:103, 22:26, 33:33 and 
74:4. The verse at 22:26 echoes that at 2:125. The remainder use this form of the t-h-r root to denote cleansing people : 
hearts, bodies or clothes. Nowhere is it used with anything not directly connected to the human condition. The verse at 
33:33 is particularly interesting in this regard as it mentions cleansing the people of the house. While these facts do not - 
taken in isolation - conclusively dispatch the Traditionalist's claims for this verse (namely, those of cleansing a temple of 
idols), they should be known by any serious student of the Qur'an. 

322. 2:125 [4], Arabic: hayt- house, household. Again, this phrase may indeed relate to the cleansing of a particular physical house 
in which God was worshipped as the Traditionalist claims; I find this unlikely given the usage of the verb across the broader 
text, but I do not know and cannot prove a case one way or the other. And nor can the Traditionalist - at least not on the 
basis of Qur'anic facts. If his inclination happens, in fact, to be the case (that what is meant here is a physical house), the 
place which the verse references is now lost to us (since Petra is now a ruin, and 9:28 closes this chapter of history 
conclusively). However, the statement can also be understood in a way which does have Qur'anic support and which can 
serve as a lesson today if we take the house which Ibrahim sought to purify to be that of his own family line (which is the 
point of the entire section of 2:125-141). Ibrahim is, by common consent, the great patriarch and example of monotheistic 
belief. The job of his descendants was to be pure and take monotheism to the world. We can all act on that imperative. 

323. 2:125 [5], Arabic: tawafa - to move about. The use of tawafa occurs with the object ancient dwelling (22:29). I contend that 
this ancient dwelling is the grave site at Petra, Jordan, and that tawafa is used here in this regard to mean to move about 
(here: among graves ). The Traditionalist again affixes a highly specific, religious sense to tawafa to achieve to perform 
circumambulation (by which he means a religious rite comprising walking around a shrine). However, the Qur'an uses 
tawafa simply to mean to move about, to go among (see 24:28, 37:45, 43:71. 52:24, 56:17, 68:19, 76:15, 76:19). I do not 
claim my understanding to be definitively correct because I do not ascribe force of doctrine to ambiguous statements. I do, 
however, claim the Traditionalist's assertions in this regard to be objectively wrong since the city known today as Makkah is 
demonstrably not the place of pilgrimage found in the Qur'anic narrative or as understood by the first Muslims (see Article 
XVIII). 

324. 2:125 [6], Arabic: ‘akafa - to be devoted (to), to remain (in or at). 

325. 2:125 [7], Arabic: r-k-‘- lowly (i.e. before God). See Article V. 

326. 2:125 [7], Ibrahim's obedience again contrasts with the recalcitrance of the children of Isra'Il seen in preceding verses. 
Arabic: s-j-d. See Article VI.

330. 2:127 [1], Arabic: wa idh. See note to the beginning of 2:124. 

331. 2:127 [1], The Traditionalist claims this verse to indicate the raising of physical foundations of a building, namely that of a 
building in Makkah which he calls the ka'aba. I reject the possibility that he is factually correct out of hand given the 
impossibility of Makkah as the site of Ibrahim's sanctuary (see Article XVIII). However, some may decide that even though 
the Traditionalist is fixated upon the wrong location he is correct about the general sense of the verse so I will now address 
the broader subject on the basis of etymology. This form of the root r-/-‘ (which the Traditionalist takes to mean raising ) 
occurs 22 times in the Qur'an (2:63, 2:93, 2:127, 2:253, 4:154, 4:158, 6:83, 6:165, 7:176, 12:76, 12:100, 13:2, 19:57, 24:36, 
35:10, 43:32, 49:2, 55:7, 58:11, 79:28, 88:18, 94:4): leaving aside the verse here at 2:127 and that at 24:36 (both of which 
relate to bayt or its plural) nowhere does this verb form relate to the creation of physical structures by men. That is not to 
say that I claim that the Traditionalist's general thesis - location notwithstanding - is objectively wrong. I don't know. And, 
frankly, nor does he. My position is that to base specific theological doctrine on ambiguous statements is not acceptable. 
What is acceptable in circumstances such as these is to look at the preponderance of Qur'anic evidence. And on that basis, I 
feel justified in the rendering as here with the r-f- root presented elevated and ascribing to qawa'id its non-physical sense of 
precepts given a Qur'anic context which treats of Ibrahim creating a family, a dynasty, a faith. I find it more reasonable given 
the preponderance of Qur'anic evidence that a man who had left his tribe (which represented his worldly status, support and 
protection) because he would not follow its cult of created idols would then begin a new tribe based on purely monotheistic 
precepts free of idolatry than I do that he would build a new idol in the desert and begin bowing down to that. I cannot prove 
objectively that my thesis is correct; I simply argue that it makes more sense, given the Qur'anic evidence, than popular and 
persistent alternate assertions. See note on qawa’id which follows. 

332. 2:127 [1], Arabic: qawa'id. The Traditionalist has it that this word relates to a physical building and he interprets it as 
foundations in the sense of structural foundations. While I do not claim historical objectivity for my own understanding, I do 
know that the Traditionalist has none for his, at least as far as his narrative relates to the city of Makkah. What I argue is that 
the preponderance of Qur'anic evidence is against the Traditionalist's core claim at this point, no matter where located. This 
form of the q-'-d root occurs three times in the Qur'an (2:127, 16:26 and 24:60). At 24:60 the word relates to women 
specifically and we can disregard it for the purposes of our discussion here. While the remaining verse at 16:26 does relate 
to the foundations of a building - a fact which might seem to lend support to the Traditionalist’s view - it is an unassailable 
fact that 16:26 can only be interpreted (and is, in fact, translated by the Traditionalist himself) as a non-physical house. My 
argument, then, is: if qawa'id unequivocally indicate the metaphorical foundations of a metaphorical house at 16:26, at 2:127 
it makes more sense to assume an equivalent value for the word than it does to assign a contrary value to it on the basis on 
no hard internal evidence. The word qawa'id legitimately means bases, groundwork, foundations and basic teachings (the 
latter found, for example, in the Arabic expression: qawa'id ad-din). It is on the basis of these considerations that I render 
qawa'id here precepts.

religious rites [the details of which he claims to know). Perhaps he really does. But if he does, he has no Qur'anic support for 
such claims: the fact is that the Qur'an leaves the case open. The injection of religious certitude drawn from other sources 
into matters which God left open has no validity in the methodology used here. Also of note is the fact that it says here 
manasikana (our rites). It does not say the rites for all time, or even your rites, but our rites (cf. 2:141). The only rite 
specifically given in the Qur'an is very simple and is found at 22:34.

360. 2:136 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

361. 2:136 [2], Arabic: al asbat. This clause occurs at 2:136, 2:140, 3:84 and 4:163. While where this formula appears what 
follows it differs in each case, the leading statement and word order are stable: to Ibrahim, and Ismct'il, and Ishaq, and Ya'qub 
and al asbat. In Arabic, the word asbat has two possible meanings: grandchildren or tribes. The Traditionalist assumes that it 
means tribes. Yet we learn at 4:163 that al asbat received wahl (instruction or inspiration from God). We also know that 
among Ibrahim's broader progeny there would be those who disregard God (2:124). Since we know that men who disregard 
God do not receive wahi - and we know that there have been countless ungodly men among the tribes - it is not 
unreasonable to consider grandchildren as the possible value. If we proceed on that basis, it is interesting to note that the 
formula always states Ya'qiib and al asbat. The principle figure, of course, is Ibrahim. Ya'qub is himself a grandson of Ibrahim 
via Ishaq. However, (according to the Jewish Bible) Jacob had a twin brother Esau, and Abraham had other sons: Ishmael by 
Hagar and another six sons by Keturah: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. That all of Ibrahim's

grandsons - of whom Ya'qub was one, and which number included the sons of Isma'Il and Ibrahim's other sons - received 
instruction from God is something I can accept as potentially factually correct. That all members of the tribes descended 
from Ya'qub received instruction from God [and are de facto godly men) is something I know not to be true. For this reason I 
render the term al asbctt in this context grandsons. The word asbat occurs without the article at 7:160 and there clearly does 
denote tribes. This reading, incidentally, fits with the broader thesis that Ibrahim's primary mission was to create a new line 
of men which would found families and tribes submitted to God alone. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

365. 2:138 [1], Clearly indicates the Christians (baptism) and the Jews ( mikveh ), both rites involving water (in the case of the 
former, immersion in water is not only the initiating rite, but held to cleanse a man from all sin). However, the underlying 
nuances of the Arabic also reference the immersion of cloth during the process of dying fabric, so I have rendered it here as 
immersion since this encompasses both senses. The Qur'an does not decry the rites themselves; it directs the attention away 
from the details of religion and towards God - a point which sets up what follows. 

366. 2:138 [1] Instances where speech either trails off or is clipped through interruption are found at 2:138, 3:73, 6:143, 6:144,

372. 2:141 [1], Lit.: passed. 

373. 2:142 [1], Arabic: qiblah. Whereas qiblah can mean focus or direction or general course (and such a reading fits the context), 
the Traditionalist inserts - and insists upon - a highly subjective, specialised and cultic value for qiblah, that of direction of 
prayer. This value is not sustained by Qur'anic usage and context; rather, it is antagonistic to both. For example, what directly 
follows talks of 'guidance' and a 'straight path' - both of which are general moral, not physical concepts; yet the 
Traditionalist claims qiblah to have a highly specific and physical connotation. Here and in the verses which follow bowing is 
nowhere mentioned and the Traditionalist cannot even point to his value for salat. Rather, the context dismisses adherence 
to assumption and dogma (2:140) and emphasises the importance of individual responsibility over merits of group 
membership or precedent (2:141). In the only other context in which it occurs (10:87), qiblah can only sensibly mean focus, 
purpose, goal, course or direction, that to which one directs one’s attention - which are acceptable values for the term - and is 
often rendered there along those lines by the Traditionalist. I stand by my principle of not allowing subjective, specialised 
values to supplant established common meanings, and render qiblah here accordingly as course. It is true historically that 
Muslims have built places of worship and it is also true that they face a number of directions and that each instance of such a 
direction is today called a qiblah. These facts are not in question; the question is whether such a value can be ascribed to the 
Qur'an's use of this word - and on the basis of its contents and contexts, it cannot.

377. 2:143 [3], Arabic: rasiil - messenger. Clearly, there are cases where one would like to render Messenger rather than 

messenger. However, such value judgments become thornier the further one goes - and with just one imperfect call, one is 

back on the road to exalting men beyond their qualifications. The simplest course is to render in English after the Arabic, 
which language makes no use of capital letters. I follow the same line of reasoning with the word prophet. 

378. 2:143 [3], According to the Qur'an, then, this is the purpose we are to fulfil: to pass on what the messenger brought to 
mankind: religion (in terms of dogma and rite) is absent throughout.

which Arab tribes performed a pilgrimage to worship, to visit and bury their dead, to trade, and to meet and to talk; that 
location was not at Makkah but, rather, at Petra in modern-day Jordan (see Article XVIII). There is no further obligation 
connected with al masjid al haram since the Qur'an clearly indicates the end of its use (see 9:28 and related notes). The focus 
upon that place was the obligation upon the messenger for the duration of his mission. However, that mission is now closed

12:68, 16:26, 16:45, 39:25, 59:2, 65:3, 65:6, 68:44. Comparison of all instances reveals it to have two functions. The first, as

2:222, 7:19, 12:68, 59:2, 65:6). The second is effective where min haythu is followed by la in which cases it has the 
connotation of without + pronoun object + gerundial verb (e.g. without them knowing ) (7:27, 7:182, 16:26, 16:45, 39:25, 65:3,

412. 2:150 [5]. Arabic: hujja - argument (as in justification or claim in a court or elsewhere). The focus on the inviolable place of 
worship [al masjid al haram) was in order to warn and to exhort (or to use modern Christian parlance, to deliver one's soul 
to) those who were either ignorant of God or in rebellion against him. Once warned, people were identified on the basis of 
their response and - from that point onwards - culpable.

425. 2:155 [2], Qur’anic definition: al sabirun. Typically rendered (and rendered here) the patient, the present context provides 
the fuller Qur'anic definition: those who say when misfortune befalls them: We belong to God and to him we are returning. This 
refers not only to what one says verbally, but to what one's actions and demeanour imply, as well as to one's philosophy and 
doctrine. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

426. 2:157 [1], Arabic: salawat. I.e. such duties as are incumbent. See 2:43 and Article III. The Traditionalist abandons his value of 
ritual prayer for salat [salawat] at this point in favour of blessings. The value I demonstrate here of duties for salawat 
requires no adjustment. The verse here simply tells us that God has committed himself to certain duties with respect to 
those who remain steadfast and faithful in the face of hardship. God's duties are his part of the initial covenant found in al 
fatihah and summarised at 1:6-7.

158. Al safa and al marwa™ are among the tokens of 
God. 428 




cJ:Jl 




So whoso made pilgrimage to the house 429 or 
visited: 430 


427. 2:158 [1], These two words occur only once each which makes them vulnerable to the type of specious interpretation one 
has learned to be wary of in such circumstances. Here, somewhat predictably, the Traditionalist makes highly specialised 
claims for his religion (that the two words in question represent rock outcrops at al masjid al haram, and that pilgrims 
historically walked between these two rock outcrops for some purely religious reason; and that one who accepts the Qur'an 
should do likewise; and that he, the Traditionalist, knows how this should be done). His claims are without foundation in the 
Qur’an and can in no way be verified on the basis of its text - a fact which the Traditionalist knows and utilises to gain 
leverage for his broader claims. I cannot definitely prove that he is wrong in his claims for al safa and al marwa. It is 
impossible to prove a negative. Therefore, in the interests of intellectual integrity, I should allow that he might be right: 
perhaps al safa and al marwa do indeed indicate two small rock outcrops - bereft of Qur'anic substantiation though the 
assertion is. I admit all manner of things I cannot disprove as abstract possibilities, and I have no reason not to extend the 
same allowance to the Traditionalist's claim here. However, given that the preponderance of genuine historical and Qur’anic 
evidence places the theatre of the Traditionalist's religious assumptions at Petra; and given that Petra is approximately 1,000 
kilometres from the city the Traditionalist claims as his religious centre (see Article XVIII); and given that an obligation of 
any kind centred on al masjid al haram was concluded at the time of the Qur'anic revelation (see 9:28), while admitting the 
theoretical possibility in general terms of the Traditionalist's claim on this question, the only conclusion I can reach based on 
all the givens is that it doesn't matter much if he is right or not about his outcrop theory. If al safa and al marwa in fact 
denote outcrops, the Traditionalist is unquestionably walking around the wrong ones, not that this fact matters much to me. 
The Traditionalist can walk where he likes. I am interested more in what the Qur'an has to say than in where other men - 
especially ones who refuse to do due diligence on what they claim to believe - choose to walk. In my theological process I do 
not allow that doctrine can or should rest on ambiguous contexts or statements. I will now state my own thoughts about al 
safa and al marwa. I make no doctrinal claim for the thesis which follows - in the same way as I deny the Traditionalist the 
right to impose a theological construct upon me by his reading of this point. My case for the meaning of al safa and al marwa 
is this: we should remember that the Qur'anic text we read today contains diacritic and other textual accoutrement which is 
interpretive in nature. This is not unusual for texts written in Semitic languages where they are deficient in certain markings 
in their simplest written forms. Jewish texts have likewise passed through a process to clarify and standardise their 
readings. In the earliest Qur’anic text such items as short vowels, hamzas and shaddas were not marked, or were marked 
inconsistently. This means that in the original unadorned text the two words in question read -Isfa and -Imrwh. These can 
acceptably be pointed as -Isafa’ and -Imuruh which process yields the values felicity and manly generosity respectively, which 
is the reading I incline towards, absent better information. These values make sense to me; the Traditionalist's assumptions, 
frankly, do not. I leave these two values untranslated. 

428. 2:158 [1], Arabic: sha'air allah - the tokens of God. The Traditionalist has it that 'the tokens of God' (2:158, 5:2, 22:32, 22:36) 
are something particular to his religion. This is nowhere supported in the Qur'an. A token is something which indicates the 
existence of something else. The plain meaning of 'the tokens of God' is those things which indicate the existence of God. All 
instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

429. 2:158 [2], Arabic: hajja al bayt. This is the only instance of the verb hajja and it occurs in the past tense. The Traditionalist 
claims, on the basis of no Qur'anic evidence, that hajja al bayt means, in effect, perform a set of pilgrimage rites found 
nowhere in the Qur’an at a religious centre (for which there is no genuine Qur'anic support) in Makkah - a city which does 
not exist on any map until 900 CE. What the text actually says is to 'hajj' the house. I accept that the noun hajj denotes a 
pilgrimage in the Qur'an because it is an established historical fact that annual pilgrimages were a feature of life in the 
region (i.e. to Petra), and because the noun hajj is used in all cases in the Qur'an in support of that sense. However, what the 
reader without access to Arabic may not know is that the root h-j-j denotes debate or argument and is commonly used in the 
Qur'an in those senses (form III verb: 2:76, 2:139, 2:258, 3:20, 3:61, 3:65, 3:66, 3:73, 6:80, 6:80, 42:16; form VI verb: 40:47; 
noun: 2:150, 4:165, 6:83, 6:149, 42:15, 42:16, 45:25). While I do not contend that pilgrimage (hajjj as a noun and argument 
or debate are synonymous, it is beyond question that there is a strong etymological connection between them in Arabic 
generally, and in the Qur'anic treatment of verbs and nouns based on the h-j-j root specifically. This fact suggests that the 
pilgrimage was - at least in part - an occasion for debate among those who attended. Rather than attempt to prove that hajja 
al bayt means to debate the house (a point which I can argue, but cannot definitively prove) I have defaulted to the 
Traditionalist's own reading since one can safely concede the point to him to no effect given that al masjid al haram - no 
matter where located - has long been closed to those who follow the Qur'an as a place of pilgrimage (see 9:28). 

430. 2:158 [2], Arabic: ‘amara. The form VIII of the verb 'amara occurs only once in the text. This makes its value difficult to 
identify on the basis of pan-textual usage. This instance of the verb is often given an acceptable, though arbitrarily-chosen 
value by the Traditionalist (to visit), a claim which is then developed and extended into a religious nomenclature for which

he has no Qur'anic basis. However, Lane lists the meaning of this verb as to aim at or to purpose (p. 2154). But since I cannot 
form a strong case for this meaning given the paucity of instances in the text, I have erred on the side of caution and followed 
the Traditionalist's predilection. Again, since the locale is held to be al masjid al hardm it does not matter particularly what 
this instance of 'amara means since al masjid al hardm is closed as a place of pilgrimage to those who follow the Qur'an (see 
9:28) and the verse is now of a historical or analogous value only.

433. 2:158 [3], Grammar: dual; i.e. (as I argue above) between felicity and manly generosity. This was the example of Ibrahim in 
his dealings with his father's household and people. He did not become shrill or violent. He retained humour and chivalry in 
his dealings as far as he could without compromising the principle of duty to God. 

434. 2:159 [1], Cf. 2:143; 2:150-152. Our job is not to claim a religion found nowhere in the revelation of God. Rather, it is to bear 
witness to the veracity of the revelation of God and the few, simple laws held therein; it is to give both good news and 
warning to our societies. The three so-called major monotheistic religions are themselves monuments to men’s resolute, 
institutionalised refusal to implement God's imperative across the ages; rather, they have built buildings, created racial or 
factional cabals, and propagated doctrines based in sources other than the revelations the messengers themselves brought.

forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's 
authority (see 7:172). 

470. 2:177 [15], Arabic: dta al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation dta al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

And whoso of you is sick or on a journey: 


489. 2:185 [1], Arabic: shahr- moon, month. 

490. 2:185 [1], The word ramadan means vehemently hot or vehemently heated (of the ground under a hot sun). It also denotes 
vehemence of action (lit.: of the falling) of the sun upon the stones and sand, etc.; the burning and intense heat of summer. This 
word was attached to a particular month only subsequent to the Qur’anic revelation, a fact which is of historical and 
sociological interest but has no intrinsic bearing on any process concerned with the Qur'an. 

491. 2:185 [1], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out. 

492. 2:185 [3], Sc. which has now reached you. Arabic: furqan. In the Qur'an, furqan denotes the division between the people of 
God and the world at large; those who heed warning and those who reject it. See 2:53. 

493. 2:185 [4], Arabic: shahr - moon, month. 

494. 2:185 [5], The verb sama takes it as a direct object. It is clearly a time phrase since if it denoted fasting from a thing the 
preposition would be min (from ) or an analogous preposition. However, nouns indicating time (day, hour, etc.) when they 
appear with no preposition indicate on or in (cf. on the day, in the hour). They do not indicate during or over the course of. 
Lane (p. 1759) feels he needs to overcome this point explicitly and states that sama a shsh uhra (which is the form here) 
actually means sama fi a shsh uhra. What he is trying to do is bring what the Qur'an says (let him fast in or on it) into line with 
Traditionalist dogma (let him fast during or over the course of it). It is a difficult concept for certain mentalities to grasp, but 
the requirement of fasting at 2:185 is the same as that of giving (see Article IV) or of dowries, good works and other such 
things: you have to give something (here: fast each month), but how much you give is up to you. 

495. 2:185 [5], The facts as found in the text are: 1. the Qur'an was sent down in a particular moon (one characterised as 
ramadan); 2. if we witness the month (i.e. any month) we are to fast in it (i.e. that month). The fact is that the text does not 
say fast during or on or in a month called ramadan. One may reasonably assume that the beginning of the month is indicated 
(i.e. the new moon) since that is the point at which one witnesses any month - however, this point is not made explicitly.

500. 2:187 [4], Arabic: bashara. The reader may be interested to know that the root of this verb is the same as that rendered 
throughout give (glad) tidings. There is in the Arabic an underlying sense of bringing pleasure and of joy in the verb here 
which my powers of English are not equal to rendering in my native language with comparable associations. 

501. 2:187 [5], I.e. the moment at which threads of different colours may be distinguished by the light of dawn. 

502. 2:187 [6], I was of the opinion for some time that layl meant only dark night. However at 79:29 we read that God darkened 

the night. From this, I infer that since night can be darkened night must exist in states lighter than that of dark. On that basis, 
I take night to begin the moment the sun ceases to be visible above the horizon; but God knows best. 

503. 2:187 [7], Cf. 2:197. This might seem an obvious point to those from a Christian background, but one should appreciate that 
the Qur'anic culture is one where the mosque is the centre of the cultural, devotional and - to some extent - economic life of 
the community. It is my opinion that this directive anticipates the time when mosques came to form an archipelago of safe 
places, the first port of call for a Muslim in an unfamiliar town and, often, a place where a traveller might both eat and sleep. 

504. 2:187 [7], Arabic: 'akafa. - to be devoted (to), to remain (in or at). See 22:25

529. 2:194 [1], Arabic: alshahr al haram. A month wherein there is no killing (either between factions, or of land-based animals). 
That al shahr al haram is a period defined by men by treaty is borne out by 9:1-5. The term occurs also at 2:217, 5:2 and 
5:97. Nowhere in the Qur'an are particular months mentioned in this regard. The Traditionalist, on the other hand, claims to 
know exactly what these months are called and when they occur. If the claim is that here what is meant is an inviolable moon 
with regard to the pilgrimage then, clearly, such months were known to those alive at the time of the revelation. These 
details are not found in the Qur'an because later generations have no need for them - the pilgrimage is now closed (see 9:28 
and Article XVIII). We have no need of such details in the same way as we have no need now to know precisely on what spot 
Musa met with the Fir'awn and his sorcerers. Such events are histories the points of which are today general and moral, not 
specific and to be replicated - unless one insists upon binding himself to a religion nowhere found in the Qur'an. The point 
contained here which can be applied today is that peace treatises covering periods of time may be made and should be kept. 

530. 2:194 [1], I.e. it exists for itself; it is a one-off. 

531. 2:194 [2], I.e. deeds which contravene what is forbidden during an inviolable month.

536. 2:196 [1], Arabic: € -m-r. This noun occurs only twice (here and later in the same verse). The Traditionalist ascribes a highly 
specific, cultic value to the word (i.e. that of out-of-season hajj - the details of which he claims also to know). The 
Traditionalist’s claim can demonstrate no purchase upon the text - a fact which he indirectly acknowledges by dint of his a 
priori acceptance of (and insistence upon) an entirely different literature. I have rendered in accordance with the word's 
non-sectarian and - in the words of Lane (p. 2207) - ‘primary 1 signification (which, to be fair to the Traditionalist, is in basic 
alignment with his claims over the word - minus the dubious specificity he wishes to ascribe to it, and for us to accept at his

religious value to a word for the meaning of which there is no Qur'anic proof; and secondly, because the value the 
Traditionalist ascribes to hadya starkly contrasts with the root meanings of that word. Whereas guidance throughout 
denotes guidance from God, I take hadya to denote guidance conceived of by man - and that being the case, requirement (in 
the sense of formal advice or directive ) is a fitting value - and I do so for three reasons: firstly, because it accords with the 
standard, non-religious dictionary definitions; secondly because it integrates with the broader semantics of the Arabic root 
as found in the Qur'an in all other cases; and, thirdly, because it fits all contexts. Where this word occurs in combination with 
mahill in the formula 'until the requirement reaches its destination' (2:196, 48:25) the value is clearly a collocation denoting 
’until what should take place occurs' (see note to 48:25). Even were the Traditionalist right in his claims for hadya, the point 
is redundant in any case since al masjid al haram is demonstrably closed to those who follow the Qur'an (see 9:28). All 
instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

538. 2:196 [4], Historically, head-shaving has been associated with piety, initiation, pilgrimage, war and death. The facts with 
supportable bases are that hajj took place at Petra (see Article XVIII) where the Nabataean Arabs converged at least once 
yearly at the sanctuary and burial city there to meet kin, bury their dead, to worship God, to trade, and - one must assume 
given the etymological meaning of the h-j-j root - to debate, perhaps on questions of ultimate truth. It is my best guess that 
what is meant here with regard to shaving the head is that a man was to wait until a given day or a particular station in the 
hajj before shaving his head or cutting his hair in order to give him the time to hear out all the arguments before making a 
decision, a decision which was marked by the shaving of the head; however, these are speculations. Such speculations have 
no greater theological significance to us now than do speculations regarding the Qur'anic histories of‘Ad or Fir'awn. The hajj 
mentioned in the Qur'an passed into the pages of history more than 1,300 years ago. The details and form of that tradition 
were known to the people for whom Petra represented a cultural, religious and social centre. If the specific details of that 
institution were important for all people and all times they would have been included in the Qur'an. They are not included in 
the Qur'an, a point which the Traditionalist readily (even vociferously) acknowledges. What remains with regard to hajj - as 
with all other Qur'anic histories - are principle lessons only. Shaving occurs at one other place: 48:27. 

539. 2:196 [4], Arabic: hadya. Lit.: until the requirement reaches its destination. I.e. only at the right time. See 2:196. 

540. 2:196 [4], Arabic: mahill - destination, time or place at which an obligation falls due. Occurs at 2:196, 22:33, 48:25. 

541. 2:196 [5], Arabic: '-dh-v. See Article XII. 

542. 2:196 [5], Said by the Traditionalist to mean something requiring the cutting of hair outside of known, prescribed contexts 
(i.e. those contexts which the Traditionalist himself claims to be binding upon believers but which are nowhere found in the 
Qur’an). One might as easily argue the opposite case: that it indicates something preventing the cutting of hair outside 
prescribed contexts. However, this is a point of no pressing moment for us now. 

543. 2:196 [7], I.e. when you are not prevented (cf. 2:196).

560. 2:198 [1], Arabic: junah. See Article XHI.ii. 

561. 2:198 [2], Arabic: ‘afada. This form IV verb occurs in 7 places (2:198, 2:199, 2:199, 7:50, 10:61, 24:14 46:8). The 
Traditionalist is forced to render this verb inconsistently to achieve his predefined purposes, and welds highly arbitrary 
religious values to it which are of doubtful validity on the basis of Qur'anic usage, the context, or the norms of Arabic. This 
verb has three basic meanings: to speak at length, to expound (either with no preposition, or with a proposition such as fi); to 
be [fully) engaged in or to abandon oneself to (which meanings take /i); to pour forth (a transitive verb taking an indirect 
object with ‘ala). Having reviewed all instances and found that the case at 24:14 admits of no other reading than to speak at 
length, to expound I have rendered thusly in all cases where that is admissible - namely, in those cases which do not take an 
indirect object with ‘ala. Where the verb takes ‘ala, both the requirements of Arabic and the Qur’anic context dictate that the 
only possible meaning is to pour forth (in a transitive sense). I have rendered according to these principles in all cases. All 
instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

562. 2:198 [2], Arabic: ‘arafat. The root means: to recognise, discover, find out, acknowledge as being true. This word occurs once 
only. Given the preponderance of words based on this root in the Arabic language, my opinion is that it is a simple plural 
noun based on ‘arfat (a question, questioning, respecting a subject of information, how to know it - Lane p. 2067) and 
therefore ' arafat, as a plural noun, means known subjects, subjects known, or subjects which you know. The Traditionalist 
affixes a highly arbitrary religious value to this word, one not supported by the broader Qur'an, the local context, or the 
norms of Arabic. As per other similar contexts, it is not a point of doctrine what the meaning of ‘arafat is or was. The verse 
treats of a former people, a people for whom al masjid al haram was of religious significance. That time has now passed (see 
9:28). 

563. 2:198 [3], Arabic: mash’ar. This word occurs once and means in Arabic, among other things: sensory urge, sense, feeling or 
perception. The inviolable sense, surely, is one's inner conscience. The Traditionalist, somewhat predictably, affixes highly 
arbitrary religious values to this word, none of which are supported by the broader narrative, the local context, or the norms 
of Arabic. 

564. 2:198 [5], Arabic: aldalun. See note to 3:90. Sc. then remember him especially.

569. 2:200 [2], Arabic: dhikr- calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. 

570. 2:200 [2], This statement lends objective support to the thesis here which is that Petra was the place of the pilgrimage. Petra 
is proven to be a tribal burial site going back into antiquity: clearly, remembering the names and deeds of the forebears of 
each family and clan formed a part of the offices of a journey to this site. I am indebted to Brother Usman for this insight.

understand the etymological root of the word hajj as debate and accept that debate was at least part of the object of that 
pilgrimage which was binding upon the followers of the prophet until the instruction given at 9:28 which led later to the 
destruction by the first Muslims of al masjid al haram (see note to 9:28 and Article XVIII).

712. 2:238 [2], Arabic: wusta. This word occurs once. The Traditionalist claims a specific and specious religious value for it 
(namely a 'middle' prayer - one which he takes to be what he thinks of as the afternoon prayer, and claims to the know the 
details of; his entire concept of prayer (and the number thereof) originates in a literature which bears no relation to the 
Qur'an, and I reject it as both without foundation and intrinsically repugnant to a revelation claiming to be preserved and 
complete). The facts as found in the Qur'an are these: the w-s-t root occurs 5 times (2:143, 2:238, 5:89, 100:5, 68:28) and in 
all cases it denotes a middle-point between extremes; the meaning of salat is established on a Qur'anic basis (Article III) as 
duty, the Qur'anically established value for salat fits perfectly with a Qur'anically consistent value for the w-s-t root. There 
are no convincing Qur'anic grounds I know of for rendering this collocation other than as I have done. 

713. 2:238 [4], I.e. stand up for God by remaining in prudent fear of him and obeying what he has commanded.

758. 2:256 [1], Arabic: din. See Article VII. 

759. 2:256 [3], Arabic: taahut. The root of this word is connected with excess, transgression and falsity. From the general contexts 
in which it is found I take taahut to indicate a false, oppressive order, and belief in the same. Modern society pretends to be 
secular. It is anything but that. It is run by highly religious Satanic orders, a fact which is visible to anyone with even 
moderate levels of discernment or investigative powers. Any object of attention and dedication, whether physical, mental or 
spiritual, which denies the right of the Creator of the Universe to be acknowledged and denies his laws is an idol. As 
Confucius famously noted: Signs and symbols rule the world, not rules and law. Archetypal signs and symbols are understood 
by the ruling elite and, generally, worshipped unconsciously by those over whom they rule. In my opinion, this is the 
underlying sense of taahut and of idols and idolatry in general. 

760. 2:256 [3], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

761. 2:257 [1], Qur’anic definition: alladhina amanu. Typically rendered those who believe. The definition of alladhina amanu is 
derived by comparison with its antonym. We know from the Qur'anic definition at 2:6 that alladhina kafaru means those who 
are indifferent to warning. At 2:257 this known value is set in unambiguous contradistinction with alladhina amanu. The 
Qur’anic value for alladhina amanu, then, is those who heed warning and is rendered as such throughout. All instances are 
footnoted and reference this verse. See Article Il.iv.

verb is treated in both senses by Traditionalist translators and I have done likewise, on the basis of context. All instances are

reality. The fact is that women, in general, are less knowledgeable about business than are men. A second fact is that in 

different circumstances (those where a wife is accused of infidelity by her husband alone) a woman's sole witness prevails 
over that of a man. And in slightly different circumstances it would take four male witnesses to condemn her.

statement does not require further elucidation or context.

law, but in fact are not, but are something known by means of comparison or context). An example of such a statement is: Kill 
them where you gain ascendency over them (2:191). The verse is preceded by a clear call to fight only those who fight you and 
not to transgress bounds; to cite 2:191 without the surrounding context (something practiced both by some of those in 
favour of brand Islam and by some of those against it) is to twist this Qur'anic imperative into deceit and calumny. The 
Traditionalist's highly selective reading of other particular statements may also be cited in this regard. The most common 
instance of this is the refrain one hears ad nauseam from the Traditionalist: [..Jwhat the messenger gives you, take it[.f (59:7) 
Here, he wrests one part of one verse out of context as a cover for opening the floodgates to what is the real basis of his 
religion: the hadith. The logical, philosophical and factual errors in this one statement used thus are legion. In short, those 
who wish to wrest Qur'anic context-dependent statements from their contexts will find that they are able to do so. We 
ourselves should be wary of doing likewise if we fear God and the Last Day. Those who are heedless in this regard will be 
held responsible. All we can do is advise such people against such a course and, if they will not desist, leave them to it.

about. I disagree on two counts. Firstly, I find it unlikely that God would give mankind a message it was never intended to 
understand: secondly, the Qur'an tells us to reason, and to consider it with care. On this basis, I conclude that what is given is 
susceptible to human reason and intelligence.

866. 3:10 [2], The motif of wealth and children occurs 19 times. While physical children are mentioned - and the significance 
thereof stands on its own, explicit terms - it is a reference perhaps also to numbers (i.e. to the quantity of those who follow 
or who agree with the person or persons indicated). No matter what resources and numbers be ranged against it, the truth is 
the truth; all will die; the Day of Judgment will take place. The full set is found at 3:10, 3:116, 8:28, 9:55, 9:69, 9:85, 17:6,

striking disconnect between the timeline as presented by the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis (or, rather, its Christian 
extension which places the messiah at Jerusalem around 2,000 years ago) and the narrative here if Maryam and ‘Isa are 
taken as the Mary and Jesus of the New Testament. Of interest is the fact that under the ‘Aslr-Hejaz thesis Maryam, ‘Isa and 
other personalities connected with them lived many centuries earlier, and the stories connected with the Christianity which 
developed in the 1st century CE are caiques upon these original stories, later conflated with embellishments and other 
historical characters and transposed upon a different geography. See Article XXI.

(And God knew best to what she was to give 
birth. 


jTJJ! And ma ^ e * s not like female.) 


' gr°^ A, And I have named her Maryam.” 


923. 3:35 [1], The adverb idh has within it a secondary implication, one which becomes apparent in the light of the fact that 
certain clauses in the chapter seem incomplete. They are not incomplete; rather, they reference the fact that God was (or is) 
hearing, knowing. This formula is stated twice (3:34, 3:121) and is a defining characteristic of the chapter - a point which is 
confirmed by those statements which remind the messenger that he was not present at such times or places. This 
mechanism (the use of idh in the manner described above) is observed in footnotes throughout this chapter. 

924. 3:36 [4], Arabic: maryam. This footnote expands upon comments found at 3:33. Jewish sources claim Amram as the father of 
Moses; and yet others claim ‘Imran as the Arabicised version of Amram. The children of Amram - according to Jewish 
sources - were Moses, Aaron and Miriam (the latter name Anglicised in the Christian Bible as Mary). An accusation levelled 
at the Qur'an by its detractors is that it conflates or confuses historical personalities: Miriam (sister of Aaron and Moses) and 
Miriam or Maryam (i.e. Mary), mother of‘Isa (assumed to be materially the same person as the man known today as Jesus 
who lived in Palestine 2,000 years ago). The passage here and that at 19:28 where Maryam is called ‘sister of Haruri are 
often presented in support of such assertions; such positions assume their conclusions and proceed on that basis. I refer the 
interested reader to Article XVIII and Article XXI for summaries of theses which address these points.

941. 3:44 [2]. Qur'anic usage: wahi and awha. We can understand some part of the meaning of the noun wahi and verb awha by 
the usage here. Clearly, wahi" denotes the transference of knowledge from one realm - in this case the transcendent (the 
realm of God) - to this temporal, material realm. (The point is repeated at 11:49 and 12:102.) However, it can also denote the 
transference of human will or knowledge (19:11). Traditionalist translations focus on inspiration and revelation, but I think 
they are missing a part of the point - especially given the undeniable human application of the concept at 19:11. Where God 
gives instruction we can take it as granted that a revelatory process is at work, but the operative value is that of passing 
information containing an imperative either to action or to instinct (see 16:68 and 41:12 which treat of bees and created 
heavens). In English, instruct and instruction cover the majority of required nuances. All instances are footnoted and 
reference this verse.

requirements. The concept of gospel as a man-god death cult was a later invention decreed into canon by Constantine, a sun¬ 
worshipping pagan. How such statements may be integrated with the theses summarised in Articles XVIII and XXI is a 
subject requiring further study.

962. 3:52 [2], Arabic: al hawariyyun. Muhammad Asad comments here: Al-hawariyyun (sing, hawari) is the designation applied in 
the Qur’an to the disciples of Jesus. [,..]and the evidence provided by the recently discovered Dead Sea Scrolls strongly supports 
this view - that the term hawari was popularly used to denote a member of the Essene Brotherhood, a Jewish religious group 
which existed in Palestine at the time of Jesus, and to which, possibly, he himself belonged. The Essenes were distinguished by 
their strong insistence on moral purity and unselfish conduct, and always wore white garments as the outward mark of their 
convictions; and this would satisfactorily explain the name given to them. Asad holds to the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis 
and the Christian extension thereof. The competing theses summarised in Articles XVIII and XXI would see, perhaps, the 
Essenes as a sect which carried the teachings of the original ‘Isa, a man who predated the Yeshua - or Jesus - figure by 
centuries and who was active in Arabia. It is certainly the case that the names Isa and Essene bear an easy comparison.

My view is that while such people may not be culpable for what they do not know, if they persist in pushing their 
assumptions upon those who have the Qur'an - a preserved scripture - this (i.e. what is outlined at 3:61-62) is the 
recommended course.

1031. 3:79 [4], Arabic: rabbdniyyin. Muhammad Asad's comment on this word is the most convincing of those I have read: 
According to Sibawayh (as quoted by Razi), a rabbani is "one who devotes himself exclusively to the endeavour to know the 
Sustainer [ar-rabb] and to obey Him": a connotation fairly close to the English expression "a man of God".

since Ibrahim was righteous and lived before the law was given. The very same argument could - and, perhaps, should - be 
made plain to the Traditionalist who makes parallel claims for his religion.

pilgrimage 1065 to the house 


1057. 3:95 [3], Arabic: hanif- inclining to a right state or tendency: spurning falsehood. See note to 2:130. 

1058. 3:95 [4], Arabic: sh-r-k. See 6:78 and Article VIII. 

1059. 3:96 [1], The area around Petra is known to have been inhabited for around 9,000 years and used as a tomb site since 
antiquity. See Article XVIII. 

1060. 3:96 [1], Verses 3:96-97 are in the past tense. My view is, firstly, that this house was at Petra (see Article XVIII) and, secondly, 
that it no longer matters where it was since the site at Petra is now closed. The narrative references a time in the distant 
past. The point is not the house; the point is a historical instance of God's expectation of men in response to what he had 
given them. That very point is the focus of what follows: the doctors of the law have the commandments of God in their 
scriptures, why do they not then follow those? 

1061. 3:96 [1], Arabic: bakka, from Hebrew: NDIin - weeping, deep sorrow. Petra was a burial site from ancient times - and thus a 
place of mourning. See Article XVIII. 

1062. 3:97 [1], Arabic: dyat. See Article X. 

1063. 3:97 [1], Arabic: maqdm. See 2:125. 

1064. 3:97 [2], Petra was a city of sanctuary from ancient times. See Article XVIII. 

1065. 3:97 [3], Arabic: hi]]. The Traditionalist understands this word to indicate pilgrimage. I think it indicates debate (see notes to 
2:158). Since it doesn't much matter and I cannot definitively prove my case, I allow the Traditionalist to take the point. As 
noted above, verses 3:96-97 are in the past tense. The place of pilgrimage is closed to believers as of 9:28. The scenario here 
is a history with a moral purpose and serves to set up the exhortations in the following verses.

1146. 3:136 [4], Lit.: the doers (of it). 

1147. 3:137 [1], Arabic: surmah (here: plural - sunart ), i.e. established way (of doing things). In Arabic sunnah means method or 
mode of treatment or way of doing or living and is a word one hears ad nauseam among those who have inherited or fallen for 
the Traditionalist's bait-and-switch manoeuvre (i.e. the supplanting of the Qur'an by an entirely different literature). By this 
word such people mean a fluid, arbitrary subset of the broader literature which they prefer to follow over the Qur'an which 
takes as its focus actions ascribed to Muhammad, many of which contradict both the spirit and letter of the Qur'an. The word 
sunnah occurs in the Qur'an sixteen times (3:137, 4:26, 8:38, 15:13, 17:77, 17:77, 18:55, 33:38, 33:62, 33:62, 35:43, 35:43, 
35:43, 40:85, 48:23, 48:23). In none of the instances in which the Qur'an uses this word does it signify actions performed by 
any prophet. Ah instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

1148. 3:137 [1], Lit.: passed. 

1149. 3:137 [3], I.e. they died and were sent back to God, either through natural death, human causes or God's retribution. 

1150. 3:138 [1], Arabic: baydn - clearness, plainness, patency, obviousness; statement, information; declaration, announcment; 
manifestation; demonstration; eloquence. This word occurs three times (3:138, 55:4, 75:19); the core sense is that of (clear) 
evidence or self-evident or manifest truth or fact. Ah instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

1151. 3:138 [3], See note to 2:2. We are meant to investigate the end of those who came before us. Their end is (or should be)

1157. 3:140 [5], This word (sg. shahid, pi. shuhada ') has been repurposed by the Traditionalist to mean martyr (which, in practice, 

is a somewhat generous way of describing people killed in military action], A witness may, in fact, be called upon to become 

a martyr. However, the fact of dying in a non-Qur'anic struggle to set up a temporal empire with a non-Qur'anic religion at its 
core means nothing in this context. A witness in the Qur'anic sense is someone who stands up and warns a society to turn to 
God alone (not to a religion of human contrivance]. The purpose in fighting is to protect a community so that it might 
continue to engage in the primary obligation of the type just mentioned.

contribute. However, we can say the following: ribbiyyun is from the r-b-b root (as is rabb meaning lord, sustained master, 
owner); ribbiyyun is said to be of Hebrew or Syriac origin and to mean godly men or devout men. Happily, we can corroborate 
this value by means of what follows in the verse, and I use this at the basis for the definition. If you can supply genuine 
additional historical or etymological data on this point, please let me know.

1177. 3:152 [1], Arabic: qad. I rendered the perfective mood here as remained rather than the simple past (i.e. God was true ) to 
convey the force. 

1178. 3:152 [1], I.e. the promise made at 3:151. 

1179. 3:152 [2], The use of idh here references 3:121-122 which emphasises God's knowledge of events. Cf. God was hearing, 
knowing 

1180. 3:152 [2], Arabic: hassa - to perceive, be aware-, to slay. I am wary of the Traditionalist’s handling of this word. He renders it 
killing, slaying and synonyms. The reader should know that this is the only instance of the form I of hassa in the text. This 
fact should cause us to be cautious and since we should always guard against accepting arbitrarily chosen values. It is true 
that hassa is said, when marked hissa, to mean to slay in some lexicons, but I cannot tell whether that is a genuine instance of 
Qur'anic Arabic or a later development which grew out of a culture infested with ‘prophetic' traditions. What I can say is that 
the form III verb occurs three times and means to perceive in all cases (3:52, 19:98, 21:12). The form V verb occurs just once 
and means to enquire (12:87). The noun occurs once at 21:102 and indicates sound (i.e. a sound which can just be 
perceived). On this backdrop, the claim for a single instance of the form IV verb as to slay, to kill should be treated with 
scepticism, especially in a context where to be aware makes perfect sense and to slay makes almost none. One may lose heart 
when one becomes aware of an enemy, but when speaking of losing heart to slay ill fits the context. The passage and what 
follows treat of cowardice and failure in battle, not of a lack of motivation to slaughter remaining enemies. 

1181. 3:152 [3], Arabic: hatta idhd. This collocation is rendered generally by translators as until when - and this is its function 
today in Arabic. However, a detailed review of all instances of hatta idhd in the Qur'an reveals another nuance. Here, the 
sense is consistently: when + the perfective mood (e.g. And when he had reached the sea ) and I have rendered accordingly 
throughout. The full set is found at 3:152, 4:6, 4:18, 6:25, 6:31, 6:44, 6:61, 7:37, 7:38, 7:57, 9:118,10:22, 10:24, 10:90,11:40, 
12:110, 18:71, 18:74, 18:77, 18:86, 18:90, 18:93, 18:96, 18:96, 19:75, 21:96, 23:64, 23:77, 23:99, 24:39, 27:18, 27:84, 34:23, 
39:71, 39:73, 40:34, 41:20, 43:38, 46:15, 47:4, 47:16, 72:24. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse. 

1182. 3:152 [4], Said by the Traditionalist to indicate spoil. However, the context does not treat of spoil. The context treats of the 
chance to escape with one's life. 

1183. 3:152 [4], Sc. his promise ceased to be binding upon him.

1195. 3:159 [6], This is the Qur'anic model for executive decision-making: 1. Consult with those affected. 2. Make a decision. 3. 
Trust in God. 

1196. 3:159 [7], Arabic: mutawakkilun - those who place their trust. Clearly, every man places his trust in something whether he 
understands or admits that fact to himself or not - so something more than those who place their trust must be meant. After 
consideration of all instances (3:159, 12:67, 14:12, 39:38) it is clear that what is meant is those who would place their trust 
aright (i.e. they intend to place it where it is justified). The following verse argues in favour of such a course. All instances are 
footnoted and reference this verse. 

1197. 3:160 [4], I.e. when he has forsaken you. 

1198. 3:160 [5], Arabic: (al) mu’minun. See note to 8:2. 

1199. 3:161 [1], Arabic: ahalia - to shackle, to fetter. The broader context treats of forcing followers; I therefore render in this 
context as coerce.

1300. 4:14 [1], I.e. what God sent through his messenger.

1303. 4:15 [2], I.e. four faithful witnesses who personally witnessed illicit sexual intercourse (coitus) take place. 

1304. 4:15 [4], My personal understanding of this is that it means to be chaperoned outside the house by competent family 
members. The concept and importance of sexual purity and reliance thereon will not be obvious to degenerate moderns.

Hinder 1307 them. 1308 


But if they 1309 repent and do right:

However, the Qur’anic position is that - along with faith - sexual purity is the basis of marriage, family and society, and a key 
ingredient in spiritual and moral progress. See 33:33, 33:55. See also Article IV. 

1305. 4:16 [1], Grammar: dual relative pronoun. 

1306. 4:16 [1], I.e. sexual immorality. 

1307. 4:16 [2], Arabic: '-dh-y. The Traditionalist applies meanings here to the verb from which he shies away in other contexts so 
that he might achieve his predetermined goal: namely, the right to dole out the brutality and violence he justifies on the basis 
of the literature he prefers to the Qur'an. By doing proper research, one sees that the values he prefers here (such as punish ) 
are unsustainable on any pan-textual basis. (There exists a Qur'anically-based punishment for one found guilty of the act 
under discussion here, but no such punishment is mentioned or called for at this particular juncture.) Part of the 
Traditionalist's abiding problem is that he is unable - at least on the basis of observable data - to understand the point of 
this legislation: he is, as one typically pictures him, straining for any opportunity to stage a lynching: to inflict unspeakable 
terror upon some poor, usually powerless individual (generally female), which spectacle helps deflect attention from his own 
towering incompetence and conspicuous lack of achievement. The purpose of the directive which has eluded him is, 
nevertheless, instantly clear to someone capable of rational thought, and it is this: it exists to set a society on a course which 
inclines towards virtue rather than away from it. We don’t have to go far for an example since such a society existed in most 
Western countries until WWII. In a society of such a type, if a man and a woman are determined to have illicit sexual 
relations nothing and no-one is going to be able to stop them given sufficient resources and opportunity. However, the 
society at large is not calibrated to facilitate such an activity and does not condone such behavior by providing social 
acceptance, hotel rooms, or collusion, etc. To look at this entire question of legislation objectively, one is struck by the fact 
that in order to be found guilty a couple would have to be so breathtakingly indiscrete that any subsequent punishment 
might be said to be justified on the basis of stupidity - were it not on the basis of immorality - given the lengths one would 
have go to in order to be caught. None of this interests the Traditionalist, of course. He does not follow the Qur'anic 
directives: where murdering people is concerned he is nothing if not inventive - and he claims that the Qur'an is abrogated 
by the ‘sunnah’ of the prophet (the expression sunnah of the prophet being shorthand for an endless list of things - an 
unspecified number of which are horrific, stupid and extremely unfair - which he, the Traditionalist wants to do and which are 
not in the Qur’an ). Those who spurn guidance while claiming virtue are described at length in the Qur'an. They do not end 
well: the best advice one can offer is to be sure not to be one of them. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

discretion and an honorable discouragement of wrongdoing through both word and action.

1319. 4:19 [2], Lit.: forcibly. The Traditionalist generally, somewhat predictably - and incorrectly - reads this to mean that one may 
not inherit the woman herself. The plain purport of the verse in a context (prior to a related aside which then feeds back into 
the main subject) of right financial dealings with women is: you may not compel a wife to leave you her substance when she 
dies by retaining her purely to inherit from her on her death or by disallowing her right to make bequests. In Qur'anic usage 
waratha + direct object (as here) means to inherit from (see an example at 4:11) and not to inherit (e.g. something ).

1334. 4:25 [1], Arabic: muhsinat - chaste [women). The apposition is between chaste (i.e. someone known to have had sexual 
relations only within marriage) and someone about whom that is not known; muhsinat are women protected - from within 
the culture or tribe - not those brought in as captives (by war or purchase) whose past is not known. The word muhsinat is 
often translated as free in such contexts (which I have done here) which is correct in principle but requires additional 
information to be understood.

1341. 4:25 [11], The Qur'an advises men restraint in such a case, indicating that the most desirable course of action is to marry 
free, believing women from within one's own community. Questions of tribe and race are not ignored by the Qur’an. Tribal 
and racial consciousness and related concerns are normal in all healthy societies which wish to survive.

1352. 4:34 [4], I.e. have reason to fear. See note to 2:182. 

1353. 4:34 [7], Arabic: daraba. Various imaginative interpretations of this instance of this word exist, particularly among more 

intelligent and Qur'an-focused Muslims. Their efforts notwithstanding, the verb daraba still does mean to beat or spank or 
strike and in the context here there is little else that it could mean. Naturally, this single sentence can be wrest from its 
context and made much of by people who feel that they benefit from so doing. I leave such people to enjoy whatever it is they 

think they gain from their activities. We all go to God. My position is this: the judicious spanking of a recalcitrant wife has 

been practiced by husbands who wished to achieve and maintain domestic harmony since time immemorial. It is 
recommended in the medieval Russian Orthodox handbook floMocmpou (Domostroi ), for example, and was practiced 
commonly in both ancient and later Western culture prior to the moral degradation which began in earnest following WWI 
and then with accelerated force following WWII. However, wife-spanking is still practiced today quite widely within certain 
Christian circles, and information attesting to its efficacy and value within both religious and non-religious households is not 
difficult to find. Contemporary liberals will be outraged by these facts, just as they are outraged by most facts. The high 
divorce rates, confusion of roles, demonstrable dysfunction, moral relativity and celebration of blatant perversion which are 
standard fare among the victims of Cultural Marxism serve as an indication of the extent to which one should be guided by 
such people. Some women prefer a man who is forceful - they simply do. If a woman has grown up with a father who is 
strict, it will be difficult for her to respect a man who lets her manipulate or belittle him. In addition, many married couples 
attest to the fact that when the man takes full charge of his wife it both saves the marriage and infuses it with vital energy 
and commitment. In the Qur'anic context, one must not forget that this verse is directed to those who heed warning (see 
4:29). Both parties accept the Qur'an and have access to it. The woman will know that if she pushes the man far enough he 
must - in keeping with the Qur'an - respond eventually as outlined at 4:34. She can, of course, initiate separation 
proceedings at any time. If she has not done so and has pushed her husband beyond admonishment and separate sleeping 
arrangements, it is reasonable to assume that she is in tacit agreement with what is to follow. As intelligent, reasonable 
people of good will we can take it for granted that actual crimes against the person are to be responsibly prosecuted; if we 
are not intelligent, reasonable people of good will, our primary problems reside there and not in the quality of the guidance 
we are given.

1371. 4:43 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. In its 
primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement 
at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge 
God's authority (see 7:172). In the present context, the preceding segment (at least from 4:36 to this point and, more fully, 
from the beginning of the chapter) makes a strong argument in favour of the core Qur'anic doctrine; it summarises what one 
is signing up for. The verse at 4:43 then addresses those who heed warning. I understand the approach to the duty here as a 
point at which one may choose to make a serious undertaking to accept the doctrine of God and make a public statement to 
that effect. The actual contract between the Lord and his servant is found at 1:1-7, aptly placed at the very beginning of the 
Qur'an. It is my opinion that the prayer system of the Muslims retains in vestigial form the original acceptance statement 
(not of a religion but of Qur'anic principles) by dint of its inclusion of alfatihah in every unit of its prayer system - despite 
the fact that few, if any, Muslims today guess at its primary significance or original purpose.

Then find not water: 


ifL il*^ \jiZ& 


Resort to clean soil 


1372. 4:43 [4], The instance here of the form VIII of the verb ahasala is the only one in the text. This fact makes it vulnerable to the 
Traditionalist's practice of ascribing highly specialised values to rare or unique terms - values which have no explicit 
Qur'anic basis - and this opportunity has not been overlooked. The objective facts are these: the gh-s-1 root occurs a total of 
four times (4:43, 5:6, 38:42, 69:36). Certainly, the ah-s-l root means to wash-, and in Arabic today the form VIII verb has a 
reflexive sense both of to wash and to wash completely. The Traditionalist, for his part, generally claims two types of 
‘religious' washing: ghusl and wudhu. By ghusl he means a full-body wash (which is what he claims at this verse). By wudhu 
he means the washing method (with some embellishments of his own) outlined at 5:6. He has criteria for when either ahusl 
or wudhu should be done. These criteria do not correlate with the scenarios given at either 4:43 or 5:6 (for example, he 
claims that what he calls ghusl is needed after contact with women but not that it is needed after defecation). The terms 
ghusl and wudhu are nowhere found in the Qur'an. These are verifiable facts. My understanding based on the methodology 
here is this: what is meant by unclean is made clear in the sentence following the expression then find not water (namely: 
after illness, a journey, defecation or sexual intercourse). This is a concession - what to do when one does not find water. 
What, then, is to be done in the case where water is to be found? That instruction is given at 5:6. The correlating verse at 5:6 
does not use the form VIII of the verb ahasala to describe the washing process; it bears no relation to the non-Qur’anic word 
ghusl. It uses another expression: purify yourself (based on the t-h-r root). What purify yourself means in the context is, 
likewise, understood by inference from the concessive allowance at that verse, one which is identical to that at 4:43. On this 
basis, my conclusions are these: the words for washing at 4:43 and 5:6 mean the same thing; the washing requirement for 
both cases (given access to water) is outlined at 5:6; the terms ghusl and wudhu have no Qur'anic basis (there being no case 
in which ghusl as understood by the Traditionalist is a Qur'anic requirement, and his requirement for what he calls wudhu 
exceeds that mentioned in the Qur'an). I am not arguing against washing fully after sexual contact; I am arguing against 
ascribing to the revealed word of God values it does not contain. Human washing practices and requirements over and above 
what is specified in the text are a matter of personal taste and judgment, and not of revealed imperative. 

1373. 4:43 [7], Arabic: gha’it - defecation. Typically rendered in gentler language, I have called a spade a spade to convey the sense 
which is in the text. 

1374. 4:43 [8], Lit.: touched.

1378. 4:46 [3], I.e. do not believe your own lying ears but listen instead to what we tell you - an instance of the type of chutzpah 
typically associated with Jews and which some among them practice on an industrial scale today on all major fronts - the 
distortion and perversion of both reality and history by media and the promotion of obvious fraud taught as science being 
among the most visible manifestations of this characteristic.

1382. 4:46 [9], The Qur'an is clear: God cursed those who follow - or followed - Judaism for their denial, that is, he cursed those 
among them who denied. Those among them - the Qur'an states that it is a few - who hold to Judaism and who believe - i.e. 
have not denied (by diluting or perverting faith in God into some purely materialistic, deterministic or racial religion) and 
who do good works - have their reward on the Day of Judgment as does any other believer. This is a recurring theme in the 
chapter: see particularly 4:155-162. As a side note, I have observed in life that one of the mechanisms by which God curses a 
man is to give him plenty of resources - by the misuse of which he oftentimes condemns himself.

"last part" or "end" [cf. Lane III, 846). 

1388. 4:48 [1], Much is made of this by the Traditionalist, as though it were an unpardonable sin, something akin to the Christian's 
fear of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit (although truly convincing arguments for what that phrase means are few and far 
between among Christians). The statement here can only mean that God does not forgive shirk in one who dies committing 
it, otherwise what would be the point reasoning with idol worshippers, atheists or - as is more common today - those who 
worship themselves and their own solipsistic, foolish appetites (all of which ideologies are fundamentally shirk) if God will 
not forgive them if they repent?

1399. 4:51 [2], Arabic: jibt. This word occurs only once and is not of Arabic origin. There is a number of words in the Qur'anic text 
which are of Syriac and other origin. The existence of words of foreign origin is advanced as an argument against the purity 
of the Qur'an, an argument which reveals its inherent weakness once we apply such a standard to any other language (for 
example, English). I have been guided to some extent by Muhammad Asad here who comments: The word al-jibt - rendered 
by me as "baseless mysteries" - is probably, as the Lisan al-’Arab points out, of non-Arabic origin. It denotes, according to some 
authorities, "something which is worthless in itself" or "something in which there is no good" (Qamus, Baydawi]; according to 
others, it signifies "enchantment" (Umar ibn al-Khattab, Mujahid and Sha’bi as quoted by Tabari; also Qamusj; others, again, 
interpret it as "anything that is worshipped instead of God" (Zamakhshari), and consequently apply it also to idols and idol- 
worship (Qamus, Lisan ai-’Arab][...]. Taking all these interpretations into account, al-jibt may be defined as "a combination of 
confusing ideas [dijl], fanciful surmises (awham) and fictitious stories (khurafat:)" (Manar V, 157] - in other words, abstruse 
mysteries without any foundation in fact. The modern embodiment of such a concept is Hollywood: lies built upon dreams 
upon a mirage which then suck the illusion-addict into false stories with embedded, weaponised, impoverished morals 
designed to make him depraved. I would add to this category fraudulent science - which today has all but merged with 
Hollywood - predicated on its chief stars Newton, Darwin, Einstein and NASA, and mainstream media which is run by the 
same people and provides nothing more than a parody of journalism. If you can supply genuine (non-sectarian) historical or 
etymological data to expand upon the concept of jibt, please let me know.

1419. 4:59 [1], I.e. what God sent through his messenger. 

1420. 4:59 [1], This is predicated on those people themselves obeying God and the messenger (namely the Qur'an): if they do not 
and we obey them, we have made them lords in place of God. 

1421. 4:59 [3], I.e. to what God sent through his messenger. This verse has been used to hamstring Muslims intellectually and 
politically as much as Romans 13:1-7 have been used to neutralise Christians. By reading the broader context it is clear that 
the believer’s responsibility is to what comes from God in the Qur'an. Blind obedience to human authority is what leads to 
tyranny. We are responsible alone for our actions on the Day of Judgment. 

1422. 4:59 [3], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

1423. 4:59 [3], This is not a concession; it is a command. We are meant to check what we are told by those who claim to lead us 
against what God and his messenger brought us: the Qur'an. 


318 




1424. 4:60 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

1425. 4:60 [3], Arabic: taahut. See 2:256. 

1426. 4:60 [3], This continues the thought of the previous verses. Faith in any authority not itself predicated on what God himself 
has given is itself a form of idol-worship. 

1427. 4:61 [1], This, too, is a continuation of the preceding argument against accepting as authority other than that which God has 
given.

1432. 4:62 [1], The fulfilment of this warning may be witnessed abundantly today in the pitiful condition of Muslim countries. The 
countries ruled by the Traditionalist are either so awful no-one (including, increasingly, the Traditionalist himself) wants to 
live there, or they are puppet states - or both. While the Traditionalist has a list of people he blames, the actual burden of 
blame lies with himself; he has abandoned the Qur'an. His condition is not the result of freak or unfair laws; it is the direct 
consequence of his choices. 

1433. 4:63 [4], Arabic: qawl - speech; teaching, doctrine-, saying, word.

1449. 4:76 [4], This is true on many levels, the ultimate of which is the fact that there is no escaping death and what follows. 

1450. 4:77 [1], I.e. do not fight us. Given the context and the subsequent actions of such people, it is clear these are people who 
seem to come over to the side of the believers quickly. But they are those who turn with every tide. They have no deep 
conviction but are - as they see it - pragmatists. 

1451. 4:77 [2], Arabic: ciqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense it 
is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

1452. 4:77 [3], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

responsibility: it does so by means of the third person plural and second person singular personal pronouns (them and 
thee). The argument is that the fate of the collective is in the hand of God directly whereas an individual's fate is a function - 
at least in an immediate sense - of his own decisions.

namely, a campaign - recommended but not obligatory upon the believers - to aid the exit of believing men, women and 
children who have no protectors out of the clutches of their oppressors.

1507. 4:101 [4], Arabic: al kafiriin. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. I.e. those who claim to be guided 
but refuse to obey the instructions given by God - such as the directive here to cut short a journey if there is real danger - 
such are an open enemy. 

1508. 4:102 [1], The Traditionalist thinks this passage treats of the messenger leading the faithful in prayer in the field, but an 
attentive reading shows this not to be the case. Admittedly, one needs to concentrate (4:82 implies strongly that we are 
going to need to), to understand that this segment begins at 4:75, and to realise that each of the points it treats of is 
cumulative: but when one is not welded to a preconceived value for salat and no longer needs to fight the text to achieve 
religious outcomes, a clear narrative comes into view. The entire narrative treats of a rescue mission, one focused upon 
freeing those held under oppression with no means to free themselves. 

1509. 4:102 [1], I.e. of those indifferent to warning. 

1510. 4:102 [1], Arabic: aqama al salat + la. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. By taking an object via la 
this collocation is made something one does for someone else. The scenario is clear when we cease being guided by the 
Traditionalist's assumptions and remember the context. Here, the messenger upholds the salat (i.e. initiates into 
monotheistic submission to God) for each of those who wishes to emigrate by means of the covenant about which there is no 
doubt (1:1-7). Thus, the order of events in view here is as follows: the army of the believers arrives, demands the release of 
the oppressed (but only if it can do so without undue fear, see 4:101): the oppressed are brought in groups by those 
indifferent to warning, whatever payment or other arrangements are transacted by the leader of the army of the believers 
with his opposite number, and those indifferent to warning withdraw. The oppressors take their precautions and the 
believers take theirs: no-one is killed and no-one is harmed. 

1511. 4:102 [1], Namely, the men, women and children who are to be handed over by the oppressors (see 4:75). 

1512. 4:102 [2], I.e. of those indifferent to warning. 

1513. 4:102 [4], Those being released by their oppressors. 

1514. 4:102 [4], Arabic: s-j-d. See Article VI. Here: submitted to God through his covenant (1:1-7). 

1515. 4:102 [4], Those being released by their oppressors. 

1516. 4:102 [4], I.e. behind the believers. 

1517. 4:102 [5], Arabic: s-l-w. I.e. to do such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III.

who spurn the specific guidance given them in the local context. 

1525. 4:103 [1], I.e. when the tour of duty is over. Cf. 62:10. 

1526. 4:103 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. Here it 
is that duty mentioned at 4:75. And - given a successful outcome - the oppressed are now free. 

1527. 4:103 [2], I.e. in any condition. 

1528. 4:103 [4], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

1529. 4:103 [5], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. 

1530. 4:103 [5], Arabic: (al) mu'minun. See note to 8:2. 

1531. 4:103 [6], Arabic: mawqut - appointed, fixed, set ( time ); temporary; limited in time, scheduled for a given time. This word 
occurs only once, which fact has left it vulnerable to unwarranted, specious claims on the part of the Traditionalist. The plain 
reading of the text is that our duty to God is not open-ended; it has a beginning and end. I believe this to reference the life of 
a believer which has an ordained beginning and end. 

1532. 4:103 [6]. Arabic: kitab. See Article Xl.iii. 

1533. 4:104 [1], Arabic: qawm - people. The Traditionalist assumes this to be an imperative to find people to kill. In the context, it 
is more readily understood as a continuation of that directive which began at 4:75 to find and rescue our brethren in faith

merely "a saying" or "an utterance" (which is its primary significance): it is also employed tropically to denote anything that can 
be described as a "conceptual statement" - like an opinion, a doctrine, or a belief - and is often used in this sense in the Qur’an.

female. Hence, according to some philologists, the plural form inath signifies "inanimate things" (cf. Lane I, 112). However, we

1565. 4:127 [3], I.e. what you already have. They already have an answer (4:3-6). This section illustrates the archetypal, incorrect 
attitude towards Muhammad, that of asking him for rulings. The messenger cannot give rulings; the ruling is of God. This 
section (4:127-134) has a chiding tone: restating patiently points which have already been made, three times stating that all 
that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to God, and closing with the observation that God can replace the recipients of 
the message at any time with another people.

clear: munafiqun are those characterised by an inner lack of solidity and firmness of purpose; persons easily tossed about on 
the waves of circumstance. While this value is related to hypocrisy (as commonly translated) it is also distinct from it. Strictly 
speaking, hypocrisy is pretending to believe something that one does not. The persons described here, however, vacillate 
rather than dissimulate. In short, they are waverers. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

1640. 4:156 [2], See Articles XVIII and XXI. 

1641. 4:157 [1], Arabic: masih - from verb root m-s-h; messiah. 

1642. 4:157 [1], See Articles XVIII and XXI. 

1643. 4:157 [1], See Articles XVIII and XXI. 

1644. 4:157 [2], Arabic: salaba. By convention the Traditionalist has understood salaba as to crucify. That understanding is, 
perhaps, at odds with what Qur'anic usage indicates. In the Qur'an, Fir'awn is called Lord of Stakes (38:12, 89:10). This fact 
certainly suggests that the form of capital punishment meted out by Fir'awn featured a stake. The options available for 
killing a man on a stake are limited. In close proximity to the verb commonly rendered crucify (salaba ) Fir'awn threatens 
that punishment will be inflicted ‘on the trunks of date-palms' (21:71) - thus lending credence to the notion that the trunks 
of date-palms were trimmed and sharpened to facilitate impaling. In addition, Fir'awn threatens to cut off hands and feet 
from alternate sides before executing the punishment in question (5:33, 7:124, 20:71, 26:49). Attempting to crucify one thus 
disfigured would be both impractical and run the risk of creating morbid farce - which itself would defeat the point of most 
of what benefits a tyrant from the public torture of his enemies. Finally, a date-palm does not possess a crossbar, nor can one 
readily be made from a second date-palm - a requisite item if we are discussing crucifixion in an intellectually honest 
manner. For all these reasons I render salaba and related words throughout as death upon a stake. 

1645. 4:157 [2], Arabic: shubbiha - to be made similar, to be made uncertain or doubtful. The core fact here is plain: they did not kill 
him. The implications are immediate and obvious for both Christians and Jews, as well as for relations between the two 
groups. Under the Islamic extension of the Christian extension of the dominant Jewish Egypt-Palestine thesis, it is supposed 
that the likeness of 'Isa fell upon another man who was killed in his stead. Under the 'Aslr-Hejaz thesis, 'Isa is an entirely 
separate individual to that killed at Jerusalem in the 1st century CE, one who lived centuries beforehand and was conflated 
by Paul with that Yeshua who was killed at Jerusalem and other figures to form the Christian mythos, and the Jews simply 
killed - or had killed by the agency of the Romans - the wrong man, believing him to be the messiah. See Articles XVIII and 
XXI.

1647. 4:158 [1], I.e. the agreement taken at 4:154. 

1648. 4:158 [1], This verse has been the subject of interesting but unconvincing interpretations regarding the personality of Isa. 
The syntax requires attention to unpack, but there is a single, cogent argument which runs across the broader segment. The 
argument is this: 

• 4:153 The doctors of the law ask thee (Muhammad) to bring down upon them a decree 

• 4:154 Rehearses the scenario when a decree was in fact brought down, one brought down/or their agreement. The mount 
was raised above them in confirmation of this agreement. The verb here is rafa c a (to raise). The agreement is then 
confirmed. 

• There then follows a list of grievances against the doctors of the law: 

• 4:155 Violation of their agreement; denial of proofs; killing of prophets 

• 4:156 Their denial and calumny against Maryam 

• 4:157 Their saying that they killed the anointed one ‘Isa, son of Maryam 

• 4:158 On the basis of 4:155-4:157 comes the conclusion: God brought it (i.e. the agreement) before him or before himself. 
The verb rafa'a + 'ild means to bring before, bring forward as before a judge or king (Lane p. 1128). That meaning is 
confirmed by the words immediately following And God is mighty, wise (the word wise in Arabic refers to judgment). 

• 4:159 There is no doctor of the law (i.e. true doctor of the law) save will come to faith therein (i.e. to faith in the agreement 
mentioned at 4:153) before his death, And on the Day of Resurrection it (the agreement) will be witness against them. 

• Verses 4:160-161 continue with grievances against the Jews in general on a different basis 

1649. 4:159 [1], The force of the construction is that coming to faith therein before death is the sine qua non of what it is to be a 
doctor of the law; cf. there is no marathon runner but will complete a race of 26.23 miles.

These will we give a tremendous reward. 


1659. 4:162 [2], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

1660. 4:162 [2], The on-the-nose rendering here is: But those established in knowledge among them and the believers believe in 
what is sent down[...]. I have used a different word order in the English and some may take issue with that, so I will address 
what I anticipate to be their concerns. I have strong pan-textual grounds and contextual support for the rendering I have 
used. To begin with, a second subject often comes in Qur'anic Arabic at the end of the clause, almost as an afterthought (see 
the following examples 7:155, 7:156,18:26, 22:37, 24:5, 24:10, 24:20, 24:50, 26:73, 27:18, 27:49, 28:82, 28:83, 34:10, 34:36, 
40:71,43:71, 48:29, 53:62, 57:10, 58:12, 59:8, 93:3). The entire preceding section treats of the Jews, their failings and 
misdeeds, and both this verse and the verse following indicate and connect with a summary of (mainly Jewish) patriarchs 
and key figures. With these facts in view, the phrase in the opening of 4:162 - among them - seems implicitly present within 
each of three categories which follow: [,..]the upholders of duty [among them] And the givers of the purity [among them) And 
the believers in God and the Last Day [among them). (It is difficult for the Traditionalist to access this point because he is 
mesmerised by the words salat and zakat to which he is trained from birth to attach alien, non-Qur'anic values.) My second 
point is that the concept of mu'min (believer ) does not pertain exclusively to those who embrace the Qur'an, or those who are 
or who call themselves Muslims, despite the fact that the word has been used historically as though that were the case. There 
is no direct correlation with belief and any temporal or political grouping. (Rightly understood, a mu'min is one whose 
condition of soul is imbued with a sampling of grace by which he inclines towards and appreciates the things of God.) The 
Qur'anic text objectively regards certain individuals among Christians, Jews and others (as well as those who predate both 
Jews and Christians) as mu'mins (see 5:43 for example). My position is that the entire passage at 4:153-162 forms one 
argument and has one focus: the doctors of the law among the Jews, most of whom it reproves and some of whom it 
exonerates. There then follows a broader appeal comprising a correlation between what previous messengers received and 
the present revelation (4:162-170) before the section ends with a final appeal to the doctors of the law at 4:171.

1663. 4:162 [3], Arabic: aqama alsalat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

1664. 4:162 [4], Arabic: atd al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation atd al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give [what is conducive to) - or to pay [the price of) - [sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

1700. 5:1 [1], Arabic: aUadhlna amanu. Typically rendered those who believe. See 2:257 and Article II.iv. 

1701. 5:1 [4], Arabic: hurum. This word in this form occurs only here and at 5:95 and 5:96. The Traditionalist claims for hurum a 
specialised, religious connotation (namely, the state of increased sanctity a man is said to be in when on pilgrimage). 
Naturally, the Traditionalist controls all definitions and details pursuant to this condition since his formulations are nowhere 
found in the Qur'an. However, the point at which the Traditionalist makes the correlation with pilgrimage is found not in the 
current exhortation, but in the one following at 5:2. The connection claimed by the Traditionalist is weak in any case since 
5:2 simply prohibits preventing those who wish to visit the inviolable place of worship from so doing (as one prohibition 
among several). In addition, the usual points about limitations of applicability apply since the inviolable place of worship 
was abandoned during the time of the revelation (see 9:28 and notes thereto as well as Article XVIII). This being the case, 
any claims the Traditionalist might make for pilgrimage are academic and superfluous. However, there is no reason to 
assume that 5:1 comprises an imperative relating directly to pilgrimage when analysed on the basis of what Qur'anic 
evidence we have. It is a point of principle in the approach here not to admit the application of specialised, ‘religious' values 
to ambiguous terms, but rather to default to explicit, common meanings where they exist - more particularly where they 
make sense, which they invariably do. Proceeding on that basis, we find that the singular of the word in question occurs at 
16:116 (and means unlawful in the sense of forbidden) in a context which does not admit of any other interpretation. On this 
basis I adopt the same value here (and at 5:95 and 5:96, the only other instances) for the plural hurum. It may well be that 
hunting was forbidden during the time of hajj - the forbidding of hunting by outsiders on land otherwise occupied by other 
people would certainly be an equitable law - however, there is no statement here indicating a direct correlation between hajj 
and the prohibition on hunting. Read cold, without a pre-existing anticipation of any extraneous requirement, the segment 
here deals simply with times when hunting is forbidden as a restriction with a general application. I am indebted here to 
Aidid Safar whose original insights on this point I have developed and systematised. See also note to halalat 5:2.

1702. 5:2 [1], Arabic: alladhina amanu. Typically rendered those who believe. See 2:257 and Article II.iv. 

1703. 5:2 [1], The verb here is the form IV of the h-l-I root. In all other instances it means to make lawful or be made lawful 
depending on the mood [see 2:187, 2:275, 3:50, 4:24, 4:160, 5:1, 5:4, 5:4, 5:5, 5:87, 5:96, 7:157, 9:37, 9:37, 14:28, 22:30, 
33:50, 35:35, 66:1). The instance here at 5:2 is in the negative [unlike all other cases) and treats of something which is 
already instituted. Such being the case, I concur with most other translators and have render accordingly. 

1704. 5:2 [1], Arabic: sha'air allah - the tokens of God. See 2:158. 

1705. 5:2 [2], Arabic: alshahr al haram. See 2:194. 

1706. 5:2 [3], Arabic: hadya. See 2:196. 

1707. 5:2 [4], Arabic: qalaida. This word occurs twice only (5:2 and 5:97) and both cases treat of related contexts. This leaves little 
room to assess its meaning from usage. The Traditionalist asserts a highly specialised value here (and presents himself as 
the authority, naturally, on the right interpretation and application of this specialised value). For him qalaida signifies 
garlands (to be put around the necks of animals selected by him for slaughter). I reject the value of sacrificial animal for 
hadya as spurious on the basis of provable Arabic values (see note to 2:196). With regard to qalaida I prefer to look to the 
Arabic language, context and logic for answers than rely on the Traditionalist and his imaginative claims. The facts are these: 
qalaida is a plural noun formed from the q-l-d root. The meanings of the q-l-d root focus on the investment of office, awarding 
authority, or placing in power. It is true that it can mean to adorn with a necklace, but this meaning is clearly secondary and 
subsequent to the primary meaning and grew out of the use of the necklace - or chain - as a badge of authority or office. 
Since the contexts, both here and at 5:97, treat of hunting being forbidden the question arises: by whom? On the basis of 
these considerations I contend that qalaida denotes necklaces in the sense of chains of office and not, as the Traditionalist 
claims, in the sense of garlands for sacrificial animals - a value which one assumes to have been imposed through a syncretic 
process originating in Hinduism. (Objective, methodical analysis notes the Hinduistic nature of many of the Traditionalist's 
rites and practices but finds justification for such practices nowhere in the Qur'an.) 

1708. 5:2 [6], Arabic: halal - allowed, permitted-, untied, unfastened. The Traditionalist affixes a specialised, purely religious 
connotation to this word in this case, one which defies corroboration on the basis of the Qur'an. Thus for the Traditionalist, 
this instance of this word provides the reverse of what he claims for hurum (see 5:1 and note thereto) namely, that condition 
which exists outside the specialised ritual condition he claims as the meaning of hurum. If he is right, he cannot prove it on 
the basis of the Qur’an; I suspect it is a later fiction, but I cannot definitively prove my suspicion. However, I hold to my

standard argument and methodology: firstly, whatever pilgrimage existed, the rites pursuant to it are long gone because the 
location for that pilgrimage was Petra (see Article XVIII), and pilgrimage to Petra was abandoned at the time of the

meanings for particular instances. On this basis, I render halal here according to its proven, accepted and general meaning.

1711. 5:2 [8], The Traditionalist has a cover story taken from later writings which he applies here; however, one of the central 
points uncovered by the present work is the fact that the believers were told by God to forsake - that is, abandon - al masjid 
al haram due to its occupation by the idolaters, and it is this event, in my view, which is referenced here. See 9:28.

store for them. [A comprehensive description of this practice may be found in Lane III, 1247.] As is usual with such historical

usage, see 4:43. Cf. 4:142, 5:58. If we read from the beginning of this chapter, we discern at this point a provision by which 
those outside the community of the people of the Qur'an may join that community; permission for marital connections with 
women from other monotheistic communities having just been stated along with a summary of dietary specifics, all 
information that one from an existing monotheistic faith might want who wishes to join with those who hold to the Qur'an is 
to hand. In summary, I regard the verses which treat of specific cleanliness (4:43 and 5:6) as relating to a person's entrance 
into submission to God through that contract with God which is stated at 1:1-7.

Our messenger has come to you announcing 1779 
to you within the span 1780 of the messengers 
lest you say: 


There came not to us any bearer of glad tidings 
or warner. 

Then has a bearer of glad tidings and warner 
come to you. 

And God is powerful over all things. 


And when Musa said to his people: 0 my 
people: remember the grace of God towards 
you 


When he made among you prophets 


And made you kings 1781 


1779. 5:19 [2]. Arabic: bayyana. See 2:69. 

1780. 5:19 [2]. The Traditionalist typically renders the sense here as after a period [of suspension] of the messengers. I render as I 
do for the following reasons: the verb bayyana ( announce, make clear) nowhere operates with the preposition ‘ala, and the 
preposition here seems to be hanging (the preposition ‘ala can have many meanings, to choose one at random given no 
association with a verb is simply to guess - and if the Traditionalist can guess then so can we all). Secondly, nowhere does 
the word after appear in the sentence - despite what translations typically presume, imply or insert. Nor does it say between 
anywhere in the sentence (some translators have it that there is an interval between the appearance of the messengers; but 
to treat min as between in this single instance is disingenuous and inconsistent) and the only honest ways to render min al 
rusul are: of the messengers or among the messengers or from the messengers. Thirdly, the operative noun fatrah does - as the 
Traditionalist translators say - mean a period of time or interval or span of time. However, the text simply does not say 
between messengers, it says of messengers. Lastly, I return to the aforementioned hanging ‘ala-, by constructing the entire 
verse minus this one item I was able to choose of the many values available to that preposition with some degree of 
confidence (see the beginning of 2:102 for an instance of similar usage). In summary, I believe what is in view here is that 
Muhammad’s ministry fell within that total span of time during which messengers came to men, not that it came after a lull 
in the appearance of messengers. 

1781. 5:20 [3], The Traditionalist, who has typically accepted uncritically the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and the Christian 
extension thereof, has historically experienced a twinge of awkwardness at this juncture, something which may be sampled 
by acquaintance with Muhammad Asad's attempt to ease his concerns: According to most of the commentators (e.g., Tabari,

Zamakhshari, Razi), the "kingship" of the Israelites is a metaphorical allusion to their freedom and independence after their 
Egyptian bondage, the term "king" being equivalent here to "a free man who is master of his own affairs" (Manor VI, 323f.) and 
can, therefore, adopt any way of life he chooses. The Traditionalist's problem - given prior acceptance of the dominant thesis 
listed above - is that, under that thesis, the Old Testament children of Israel had no kings under Moses; and the statement 
here at 5:20 brushes against the fur of the prevailing narratives found in the present Old Testament collection. There exist 
alternative theses, however. Under the Arabia Felix thesis, for example, Fir'awn is simply a tribal king; moreover, the 
statements at 7:128-129 and then at 7:137 appear to serve the Arabia Felix thesis against the Egypt-Palestine thesis since 
the Qur'an suggests - or appears to suggest - that the children of Israel inherited the land held by Fir'awn - a position which 
the Egypt-Palestine thesis cannot support. Given such a reading, as inheritors to Fir'awn, the children of Israel would indeed 
have been made kings in the lifetime of Musa. See Article XVIII. 

1782. 5:21 [1], Under the Egypt-Palestine thesis this, then, references Palestine - a position for which no evidence is found despite 
great efforts to produce some. Both the Arabia Felix thesis and 'Aslr Hejaz thesis field alternative locations within their 
respective parts of the Arabian Peninsula. See Article XVIII.

six million deaths in the Soviet Union alone. One must add to that genocide those killed in both world wars - horrors either

German and all white peoples in particular, although against most other races and cultures as well, and against decency and

of precluding any attempts at self-defence among those who have suffered - and continue to suffer - at the hands of

unfold with the requisite breadth and contrast to make the choices each makes therein both authentic and valid. And the 
Qur'anic position is clear: we are all going to God; the Judgment will stand; justice will be both righteous and eternal. And in 
that context, those Jews who have faith in God and the hereafter and do good deeds have as much to look forward to in 
eternity as anyone else. 

1804. 5:33 [1], The ‘reward’ or recompense mentioned here refers, surely, to the statement preceding that 'it will be as if he killed 
mankind altogether’ (and, one must assume, will be punished accordingly in the hereafter - a point confirmed at the end of 
the verse) since the phrase 'corruption in the earth’ occurs in both places and, logically, ties the two narratives together. 

1805. 5:33 [2]. I.e. the inhabitants thereof. 

1806. 5:33 [3], Arabic: salaba, sallaba. See 4:157. 

1807. 5:33 [5], Grammar: this passage is not an injunction. It is a simple statement of fact in the passive and subjunctive mood. It 
lists acts committed by tyrants (cf. 7:124 as an example), by those who war against God and his messenger and strive to 
spread corruption in the earth (the ‘they’ references the inhabitants of the earth by means of the 'that which precedes and 
which places each of the following verbs in the subjunctive) not acts perpetrated by the believers as the Traditionalist 
claims. 

1808. 5:33 [6], Arabic: dhdlika - that. Sc. is the cause for which we decreed thus for the children oflsra'Il. See the opening clause of 
5:32 which, likewise, uses dhdlika. For instances where dhdlika clearly implies ellipses see 22:30, 22:32, 22:60. That the two 
clauses following the dhdlika statement are separate from it is confirmed by the reappearance of an equivalent statement 
comprising the same components but without dhdlika below at 5:41 - which fact also serves to tie the broader narrative 
together. 

1809. 5:33 [7], I.e. those who commit such acts.

1810. 5:34 [1], My understanding is that believers are required to root out tyranny if they have the power to do so.

value - or, at least, on the basis of the evidence. Secondly, that we should know that those poor souls afflicted and killed by 
tyrants who commit acts such as those just listed will find God ‘ merciful, forgiving’.

1816. 5:38 [3], Certain countries which call themselves Muslim famously chop off people's hands. While I temperamentally incline 
to resist the Traditionalist's fascination with inflicting harm on others, having revisited this question I must concede that he 
is factually correct here: the bare, literal meaning is the operative one, but only within very clear parameters. However, the 
Traditionalist, here again, made one of his commonest mistakes: he has entirely forgotten the context. Beginning at 5:33, the 
context treats specifically of war; the believers are under military attack. And those who in such a context steal - whether 
male or female - are either engaged in pillage or plunder or are the very worse kind of opportunists, people whose actions 
are not only reprehensible in themselves but also place the military campaign in greater danger than already exists. In such 
extreme conditions there is no time for half measures, and war thieves are to be instantly punished in the firm and visible 
manner stated here both as a punishment and as a deterrent. The context also requires that those engaged only in the 
relatively lesser crime of theft in war - without having taken up arms against the believers - are not to be treated as enemy 
combatants (i.e. killed). Chopping off people's hands in peace time is a crime for which the perpetrators will have to answer 
before God. Cf. 3:7, 12:75. Arguments are advanced by sincere and compassionate people in favour of to cut rather than to 
cut off in this context, with branding as the punishment; again, I am temperamentally inclined towards such a reading but I 
do not find the textual support required for it. We find the form I of the verb here; were it the form II such as we find at 12:31 
and 12:50,1 would readily agree.

1838. 5:46 [1], See Articles XVIII and XXI. 

1839. 5:46 [1], The Traditionalist - as a passive recipient, as it were, of the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine 
thesis - assumes that this object pronoun refers to prophets, since Isa was a prophet, and he accepts the Christian's 
identification of‘Isa with Jesus (Yeshua). However, if we read the text rather than project upon it, we note that mention of 
prophets is some way back - and not a little stands between this point and that. The nearest possible preceding correlatable 
object is the ‘wrongdoers’ in the clause above, and the next nearest preceding correlatable object is the ‘them’ in the first 
clause of 5:47 - both of which reference the children of Isra'Il - either in part of in whole - at the time of the institution of the 
Torah, at least in the first instance. The collocation which I render throughout following hard upon is identified in Wehr as: 
on [its] track, at (his) heels, after (him); immediately afterwards, presently, thereupon. Thus, we are speaking about something 
which happens directly. The Traditionalist tends to render here ‘in their footsteps’ which is sufficiently vague to allow one to 
assume footsteps capable of persisting for thousands of years. However, if we review the instances where this phrase occurs 
across the text, it is clear that something immediate - almost concurrent - is meant, at least in all cases beyond this one and 
a comparable one at 57:27 (seel8:6, 18:64, 37:70, 43:22, 43:23). If we look to ‘wrongdoers’ as the reference, we have a 
subset of the children of Isra'Il at the time of the institution of the Torah; if we look to ‘them’, we have the children of Isra’Il as 
a whole at the time of the institution of the Torah. (If we consider the context at 57:26-27, we would, perhaps, incline 
towards the first of these options.) Neither scenario, clearly, fits with what the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt- 
Palestine thesis claims for Jesus; but neither does Jesus follow hard upon’ the previous prophets under that model, either. Cf.

« 3)1 & 


47. And let the people of the Gospel 1845 judge by 
what God sent down therein. 


1841. 5:46 [2], Arabic: injll - generally translated as Gospel based on the assertion that injll is a corruption or abbreviation of 
EuaYY^tov, euangelion or good news. I have followed this convention, but we still need to gain some purchase on what the 
Qur’an means by the term. Wikipedia tells us: In Christianity, the gospel (Greek: cuaryycAiov euangelion; Old English: gospel], 
or the Good News, is the news of the coming of the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:14-15), and of Jesus's death on the cross and 
resurrection to restore people's relationship with God. It may also include the descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers and the 
second coming of Jesus. This is a fair summary of what the majority of those concerned with the Gospel today mean by the 
term, and we can accept it as a starting point. The question here is whether this is what the Qur'an means by the Gospel. 
Accordingly, we need to examine its usage of the word. The Qur'anic context here at 5:46 yields the facts that the injll 
contains 'guidance and light (which together) confirm what Isa had access to of the Torah, and that it is a 'guidance and 
exhortation' to those of prudent fear. A broader review of all contexts reveals the following: it is mentioned at 3:3, 3:48, 3:65, 
5:66, 5:68, 5:110 in one breath with the Torah - from which we deduce a high correlation between the two; at 7:157 we find 
something written (both in the Torah and the Gospel) - from which we infer the Gospel to be something written (either 
extant, or lost in whole or in part); at 9:111 God promises the believers the garden in return for their lives and their wealth 
(as a promise binding upon God in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an) - thus, like both the Torah and the Qur'an, the 
Gospel contains at its heart a commitment on the part of the believer to put the hereafter before the present life in terms of 
priorities: and at 48:29 the Gospel is mentioned in relation to that parable which has survived to us as the parable of the 
mustard seed (which itself references the Kingdom of Heaven as an inner realm within a man which begins as something 
insignificant but grows to dominance within the soul and character, until such point - in the Qur'anic presentation - that the 
atheists are enraged) - thus, we identify for the Gospel the characteristic of a potent but initially imperceptible force which, 
given right cultivation, may grow within the soul of a man to such a point that it supersedes previous concerns that it comes 
to thwart attempts by atheists to quell or crush it; at 57:27 there is mention of the Gospel as something given to ‘Isa and of 
compassion and mercy placed in the hearts of those who followed it (or, possibly, him). If we consider the components we 
have garnered from the Qur'anic statements here and what we understand of the Christian position vis-a-vis the Gospel we 
have in sum: 1. Some part of the Torah teachings (and confirmation thereof) or, at least, something relatable to the Torah. 2. 
A guidance and exhortation to those of prudent fear. 3. A doctrine predicated upon the coming Kingdom of God; one which 
imbues the believer with increasing strength. 4. Something which is - or at least was - written down. 5. Jesus' death and 
resurrection as an act which reconciles man to God and forgives sin. 6. The descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers 
(understood to be an event auguring non-natural, supernatural or pseudo-supernatural abilities). 7. The Second Coming of 
Jesus (as the event marking the end of the Age). The Qur'anic position is, then, that points 1, 2, 3 and 4 either represent - or, 
at least, comply with a presentation of - what Gospel means. Points 5, 6 and 7 either find no support in the Qur’an or are 
directly repugnant to it. On the basis of the above, the working definition suggested here for what the Qur'an means by injll 
(Gospel) is: a Torah-related guidance given to ‘Isa orientated towards a reward in the Kingdom of Heaven found in written form 
and which increases the aspirant in piety. Under the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis the Qur'an's 
presentation of‘Isa - insofar as it is welcome at all - is regarded exclusively in terms of a one-to-one correlation between ‘Isa 
and the Jesus of the 1st century CE. Both the ‘Aslr-Hejaz and Arabia Felix theses begin from points which reject that 
assumption. I refer the interested student to Articles XVIII and XXI. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

1854. 5:48 [4], Arabic: shir'a. This word and its synonym at 45:18 ( sharVa ) enter English as the Sharia. The Traditionalist assumes 
the Sharia to reference a holy and extensive legal system built substantively on the Qur'an and only secondarily on the 
sayings and actions attributed to Muhammad (the most ‘authoritative' compilations of which were written down by 
representatives of a nation with every reason to resent Arabs - namely, the Persians) centuries after Muhammad's death. 
The Orientalist for his part accepts this assessment, and the popular media bandies the same about in simplified form. The 
only problem with this cosy consensus is that the Qur’an itself claims no such thing for shir'a, sharVa or any other word. 
Certainly, each nation or community has its own set of laws - and this is the point being made here at 5:48. But there is no 
sense in which there exists a holy and specially sanctified legal system which should be imposed wholesale upon a people to 
make it 'Islamic' - at least no such concept exists in the Qur'an. The very notion that a single, universally correct ‘Sharia’ of 
any sort is desirable (in the popular sense in which I am now using the term) is refuted point-blank in the remainder of the 
verse. The only legal system to which the Qur'an calls and enjoins upon the messenger is identified both in this verse and the 
next as what God sent down. This can only refer, in the context of the Qur'an, to that small number of verses which treats of 
legal matters and which provides the bones of a legal constitution, and to nothing more. The word shir'a occurs just once in 
the text, has no definite article and applies to the broad mass of humanity. The word sharVa occurs once at 45:18 and is a 
common noun with a primary or original sense of watering-place. The idea of an entire jurisprudence built on multiple 
sources (i.e. the Qur'an and anything besides it) is nowhere explicitly stated in the Qur'anic revelation.

1873. 5:55 [4], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social

this instance of wa in the Arabic incorrectly as or or nor in English. While it is not immediately clear whether we mean 
atheists as a separate, distinct category, or atheists who also make mockery and fun of your doctrine we can see that the latter 
is meant since 5:58 states And when you call to the duty they make mockery The they of 5:58 cannot reasonably be said to

But whoso goes back: 


1980. 5:95 [4], Arabic: hadya. See 2:196. 

1981. 5:95 [4], Arabic: balaaha. This verb is used in the sense of to reach, to go as far as, to arrive either concerning time or space 
or in a metaphorical sense in its form I verb instances: 2:196, 2:231, 2:232, 2:234, 2:235, 3:40, 4:6, 6:19, 6:128, 6:152,12:22, 
13:14, 17:23, 17:34, 17:37, 18:60, 18:61, 18:76, 18:82, 18:86, 18:90, 18:93, 19:8, 22:5, 24:58, 24:59, 28:14, 33:10, 34:45, 
37:102, 40:36, 40:67, 40:67, 40:80, 46:15, 46:15, 48:25, 56:83, 65:2, 75:26, its active participles: 5:95, 7:135, 13:14, 16:7, 
40:56, 65:3, and as active participle adjectives: 6:149, 68:39. Here I take the collocation as meaning reaching (i.e. including 
the inspection of) the leg-joint. 

1982. 5:95 [4], Arabic: ka‘aba. At 5:6 the word ka’aba (in the dual) has the uncontested sense of ankles or leg-joints. The 
Traditionalist himself translates it thus. The word ka‘aba occurs based on the same noun form just twice more: at 5:95 and 
5:97. Here, however, the Traditionalist claims - on the basis of no Qur'anic evidence - that the value for ka'aba is a box¬ 
shaped structure in Makkah to which one should prostrate himself. I cannot prove on the basis of the Qur'an that ka c aba never 
meant what the Traditionalist claims for it - and the Traditionalist cannot prove on the same basis that it did. What I can 
point to is the only explicitly clear instance of this word - one with which the Traditionalist agrees - and say that I accept 
that meaning, and that since it is the only objectively qualified instance of this word in the text I insist upon its value here 
also - not least because it makes sense. The Traditionalist, predictably, will point to his collection of stories written by 
representatives of the defeated Persians some hundreds of years after the death of the messenger. In a case such as this, one 
must choose whom one believes. For myself, my allegiance is to the Qur’an and the words it contains in concert with the best 
of that of which my reason and intellect are capable. To look specifically at the case in hand, my process is always to render 
according to proven values, which principle I follow here also. As mentioned, this process happens to render a value which 
makes complete sense. The scenario is this: an animal is killed when hunting is forbidden, the only remaining evidence of 
which is a skeleton. The condition of an animal can be ascertained by an inspection of the leg-joints (lameness in animals 
being the primary threat to their economic viability - especially among nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples). The sense of this 
verse is that - in order to form their judgment - the two just men should inspect the joints of the animal to ensure that what 
is given in payment be no worse than that which was taken. (This point was developed based on an original insight by Aidid 
Safar to whom I am indebted.) 

1983. 5:95 [5], I.e. in the event that there is no proof or means to repay. 

1984. 5:95 [7], Lit.: affair; matter.

carrying any load, her hair was not to be trimmed and her milk was not to be drunk except by a guest. I cannot vouch for his 
sources or the historical veracity thereof; however, one thing is clear: the Arabs at the time of the revelation lived by a series 
of fabricated injunctions, things they and their fathers had invented and ascribed to God. The argument being made is 
against 'religion'. The correlation between that time and this is painfully obvious.

2053. Arabic: tawaffd. This form V verb in the active voice (as here) is consistently used in the Qur'an with the sense of to take (i.e. 
to cause to die). The Qur'an is clear: God took ‘Isa, son of Maryam ( caused him to die). The narrative preferred by the 
Traditionalist in which ‘Isa ascends to God and is expected on the Day of Judgment has no foundation in the Qur'an; it is, 
rather, based in the hadith literature and is a syncretic intrusion originating in Christian theological and eschatological 
notions. The Traditionalist's frequent rendering here of to raise or to take up (and synonyms) is a shameless fudging of the 
facts - a workaround designed to bend the Qur'an to a pre-existing ideology originating outside it. This deceit is exposed by 
comparing how the same translator renders the same verb in all other contexts. Cf. 4:157-159 and notes thereto. 

2054. 5:118 [4], Arabic: al ‘aziz al hakim. See 3:18.

2137. 6:55 [1], Arabic: kadhdlika - thus, like this. The meaning of this verse is typically misunderstood - or simply not understood - 
by the Traditionalist, who considers the text either myopically, through the prism of his preferred literature, or not at all. 
However, the broader context - should we consider that - screams at us what is meant. In the preceding fifty-five verses we 
have met the imperative 'Say thou' a total of 17 times; by way of comparison, al baqarah - the longest chapter in the Qur'an - 
contains 18 instances of this imperative in total. The present chapter contains a total 44 instances of 'Say thou’ - more 
imperatives to the messenger to speak than any other, and by a considerable margin. Surely, then, the meaning of this clause 
at 6:55 is that God sets out and details the proofs 'thus' by means of a series of imperatives comprising 'Say thou'. Hence, the 
next clause points ahead to the following instances where 'Say thou' is present by means of which 'the way of the evildoers 
might be made manifest’. The remainder of the chapter (interspersed with pertinent asides, narratives, summaries and law) 
represents a collection of set statements and preaching methodologies by means of which the messenger - and we, the 
believers, by extension - can expose the way of the evildoers.

2168. 6:70 [2], I.e. the Qur'an - and, perhaps, more specifically the series of 'Say thous' found here (see 6:55). 

2169. 6:70 [2], Arabic: absala. The active voice of this form IV verb is said to mean to consign to destruction. However, its root 
meaning is to debar, to prevent. I take the value to consign to destruction to be a later explanation of the sense in which it is 
used in the Qur'an and assume that this later explanation itself found its way into the lexicons. Since absala appears only 
twice, both times in this verse - a context where this later explanation also makes sense - it is understandable why the 
process occurred. However, I prefer to stay with the actual rather than the inferred meaning no matter how reasonable and 
justified the latter is in this case. There is no other instance of any word from the b-s-I root. 

2170. 6:70 [3], Arabic: min duni. See 2:23. 

2171. 6:70 [4], Lit: 

2172. 6:71 [1], Arabic: min duni. See 2:23. 


474 




2173. 6:71 [4], Or 'guidance'. 

2174. 6:72 [1], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense it 
is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

2175. 6:72 [2], See note to 2:2. 

2176. 6:73 [1], Arabic: bilhaqqi. See Article XIX (bilhaqqi ii.). 


475 




2177. 6:73 [4], Arabic: al haqq. See Article XIX (al haqq i.). 

2178. 6:74 [1], Arabic: Azar. Called Terah in the Jewish Bible. 

2179. 6:74 [1], Arabic: (sg.) sanam, (pi.) asnam. Commonly translated image or idol-, while not overtly incorrect, it misses the core 
sense which is something fashioned, shaped or pictured (that is: created ). 

2180. 6:74 [1], This is the first stage in awakening: questioning the status quo. 

2181. 6:74 [2], This is the second stage in awakening: understanding the emptiness of idolatry. 

2182. 6:75 [1], I.e. because Ibrahim was already moving sincerely in the direction of truth. 


476 




2183. 6:75 [2]. Arabic: yaqina. See note to 2:4. 

2184. 6:76 [3], Arabic: afala - to pass, become absent, hidden or concealed. 

2185. 6:76 [3], Arabic: afala - to pass, become absent, hidden or concealed. 

2186. 6:77 [1], Arabic: bazaaha - to emerge, to come forth (of sun, moon, a tooth, blood, etc.). 

2187. 6:77 [2], Arabic: afala - to pass, become absent, hidden or concealed. 

2188. 6:77 [2], Arabic: al dalun. See note to 3:90. This usage recalls the word rendered error at 6:74. 

2189. 6:78 [1], Arabic: bazaaha - to emerge, to come forth (of sun, moon, a tooth, blood, etc.). 

2190. 6:78 [1], Arabic: akbar. Nowhere is God described as akbar in the Qur'an. Despite that fact, those whom we call Muslims 
endlessly proclaim him to be so. 


477 




2191. 6:78 [2]. Arabic: afala - to pass, become absent, hidden or concealed. 

2192. 6:78 [2], Qur'anic usage: sh-r-k. At 6:74 we have Ibrahim's rejection of what his people themselves made as objects of 
worship. At 6:75 God shows Ibrahim his creation; by recognising its transient nature (6:76-78), Ibrahim understands that 
creation, too, is not God. In summary, anything made - whether the fruit of our hands, our imaginations, or found in 
creation - is not God. See Article VIII. 

2193. 6:79 [2], Arabic: hanif- inclining to a right state or tendency; spurning falsehood. See note to 2:130. 

2194. 6:79 [3], Arabic: sh-r-k. See 6:78 and Article VIII. 

2195. 6:80 [3], An obvious point, but one which needs to be made forcefully, is that Ibrahim was guided. But he was not a Christian 
or a Jew. And he was certainly not a Muslim in anything close to the sense in which that term is used today.

at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge

fraudulent gods. I think the connotation is much wider than that and includes authorities of any kind (today: government, 
heavily promoted ‘scientists', opinion-makers such as actors and other semi-fictitious personas) and all fiction-based belief 
systems, including most of what today passes for religion.

2315. 6:140 [2], Verses 6:136-140 perfectly describe the activities of the religionist: he creates complicated, spurious rules and 
ascribes them to God.

2316. 6:141 [7], God has created a multitude of variations within each type of fruit and crop. One implication, surely, is that there 
are many good ways of doing things. This flies in the face of the idea popular among many religionists - and certainly 
favoured by the Traditionalist - which is that there is only one correct way of doing things. 

2317. 6:141 [9], Arabic: haqqa. See Article XIX [haqq- v.). We are to give what we can afford of everything we earn. There is no such 
thing as a fixed tithe (cf. the Traditionalist's concept of zakat, see Article IV).

2318. 6:142 [1], Arabic: farsh. This word occurs only once and is said by the Traditionalist to mean slaughter. The root meanings 
are carpet, furnishing, mat, bedding and to spread, and the root is used in this range of meanings at 2:22, 51:48, 55:54, 56:34. 
I accept that farsh has come to have the meaning the Traditionalist today ascribes to it. However, I think it is a case of 
language adapting to doctrine. My instinct always is to stay with what has a genuine basis in Qur’anic usage. This being the 
case, I think what is referred to here is the skin which is laid flat upon the ground. Quite obviously, slaughter is a necessary 
step in the process, but I do not believe it to be the primary meaning. 

2319. 6:143 [1], Instances where speech either trails off or is clipped through interruption are found at 2:138, 3:73, 6:143, 6:144, 
10:22, 12:94, 22:17, 26:24, 26:26, 26:28, 43:9, 58:22, 77:11. Here the clear function is to illustrate the continued efforts of 
those who invent lies and ascribe them to God to insinuate their fabrications into the narrative. Such, naturally, continues to 
be the case today. The chapter as a whole serves as a template and outline on how best to bear the message of the Qur'an to 
the world, what to expect in such a case, and how rightly to regard various responses. Here we have the archetypal 
religionist with his invented foolishness which he insinuates into the business of serving God. The right response - as 
modelled here - is to call him out on his claims by means of questions, thus forcing him to admit that he personally has no 
knowledge of such things and leading him to the right conclusion. 

2320. 6:143 [3], Arabic: am. See note to 21:21. 

2321. 6:143 [3], I.e. if this is the claim.

Worthy of note is the fact that those who support male sodomy and philandering of any type (which together with marrying 
the wives of one's father comprise the sins covered by fdhishat or sexual immorality ) are presented here claiming that their 
inclinations are either genetic or beyond their control (i.e. that God enjoined them upon them) - a claim the Qur'an refutes.

2436. 7:29 [2], Arabic: wajh - face, countenance, personality, true self. I take the collocation to uphold one's countenance to mean to 
(be able to) hold one's head up high in English. The context is as follows: by staying sexually clean, observing equity (which 
means integrity and consistency with inner convictions on the one hand, and faith in God alone on the other - see 3:18) one 
may come before God in prayer and worship in an effective manner. Without sexual purity it is not possible. This is why ah 
Satanic systems promote illicit sex as virtue.

2466. 7:40 [1], Arabic: ayat. See Article X. 

2467. 7:40 [3], While I neither share Muhammad Asad's confidence that the hadith literature corresponds in any meaningful way 
to actual history nor accept uncritically his assumption that ‘Isa and Jesus are necessarily the same person, his comments 
here are insightful and valuable and repeated in full: Lit., "until (hatta) a twisted rope passes through a needle’s eye"; since this 
phrase is meant to express an impossibility, the rendering of hatta as "any more than " seems to be appropriate here. As for the 
word jamal occurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubt that its translation, in this context, as "camel" is erroneous. As 
pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmed by other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn ’Abbas used to read the word 
in the spelling jummal, which signifies "a thick rope" or "a twisted cable"; and the same reading is attributed to ’Ali ibn Abi Talib 
(Taj al-’Arus). It is to be noted that there are also several other dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal, juml, jumul and, 
finally, jamal (as in the generally-accepted version of the Qur'an) - all of them signifying "a thick, twisted rope" (Jawhari), and 
all of them used in this sense by some of the Prophets Companions or their immediate successors (tabi’un). Ibn 'Abbas is also 
quoted by Zamakhshari as having said that God could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as "a camel passing 
through a needle’s eye" - meaning that there is no relationship whatever between a camel and a needle’s eye whereas, on the 
other hand, there is a definite relationship between the latter and a rope (which, after all, is but an extremely thick thread). On 
all accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as "a twisted rope" is, in this context, infinitely preferable to that of "a camel". The 
fact that the latter rendering occurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek version of the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, 
Mark x, 25 and Luke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. One should remember that the Gospels were originally composed 
in Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time of Jesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It is more than probable 
that, owing to the customary absence of vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translator misunderstood the consonant 
spelling g-m-1 (corresponding to the Arabic j-m-1), and took it to mean "a camel": a mistake repeated since, with regard to the 
above Qudanic verse, by many Muslims and all, non-Muslim orientalists as well.

2514. 7:77 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The verb ‘aqara primarily denotes "he hamstrung [an animal]"- i.e., before

("hamstringing") gradually became synonymous with slaughtering in a cruel manner (Razi ; see also Lane V, 2107 f).

2617. 7:156 [6], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation atd al zakdt is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

2619. 7:156 [7], Arabic: aydt. See Article X. 

2620. 7:157 [1], Arabic: ummiyyun. See 2:78. 

2621. 7:157 [2], The Traditionalist view is that the expression al nabi al ummiyy (the unschooled or heathen prophet) is an epithet 
used exclusively for the prophet Muhammad. While it is not a central point of doctrine for me, I don't agree with that view. 
My reasons are as follows: from 7:103 to this point (a total of 54 verses), the narrative is focused purely on the history of 
Musa. Musa was not schooled in the law; rather, he received the law by means of revelation. Under the dominant Egypt- 
Palestine thesis, he was brought up as an Egyptian; under the Arabia Felix and ‘Aslr-Hejaz theses, he was brought up in the 
house of a tribal chief named Fir'awn. In any event, by the standard we use here to judge ummiyy [i.e. one outside or ignorant 
of the law) Musa was - at least until he received the law - fully ummiyy. The expression al nabi al ummiyy [the unschooled or 
heathen prophet) occurs just twice in the Qur'an - here and in the next verse. Due to a disproportionate emphasis on 
Muhammad, the Traditionalist, in my opinion, has missed the point being made here. The point is not the Muhammad was 
unlearned and therefore the Qur'an is all the more a miracle (which is the version the Traditionalist promulgates); it is that 
Musa was unschooled and so is Muhammad. The Traditionalist view places the narrative pivot after the long account of Musa 
here at 7:157. But it is simply not there. It comes in the next verse (Say thou[...f). Logically speaking, at 7:157 the person 
being described is the same person the last 54 verse have been dedicated to; namely: Musa. It is Musa who is [,..]the 
unschooled prophet whom they find written with them in the Torah and the Gospel[...] (to the end of the verse). It is at 7:158 
that the narrative shifts to Muhammad. The point of this device, in my opinion, is to establish a correlation between the first 
unschooled prophet Musa (who brought his people out of bondage and gave them a law) and Muhammad who had a 
comparable mission for the whole of humanity. Having established this correlation, the narrative then returns to the story of 
Musa.

2653. 7:170 [2], Arabic: aqdma al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

2654. 7:171 [1], Arabic: nataqa. This is the only occurrence of this verb so there is nothing to cross-reference it with. It is not found 
in Wehr and almost ignored by Lane. I found it in an Arabic-Russian dictionary defined as pBaTb [tear, break, rip). However, 
the context is clear: the mountain was placed above them like a canopy, the requisite action for which is lift. This also fits 
with the expression raise (above them) the mount which occurs several times. In that construction the noun is always tur 
(which I render mount throughout). If you can supply genuine additional historical or etymological data on this point, please 
let me know.

2657. 7:172 [2], Arabic: zuhur. Non-sectarian lexicons list zuhur as backs and related terms - such as the word is rendered in all 
remaining cases both by me and, generally, by the Traditionalist (the full set comprises 2:101, 2:189, 3:187, 6:31, 6:94, 
6:138, 6:146, 7:172, 9:35, 21:39, 35:45, 42:33, 43:13, 84:10, 94:3). Sectarian dictionaries (such as Badawi-Haleem) list loins 
as the value. However, sectarian dictionaries are highly unreliable: they tend to list as objective fact their own questionable 
conclusions and assumptions. While I agree that loins fits the case here, that is not what it says. It says backs. Most 
Traditionalists render loins - despite the incongruity and lack of true linguistic purchase. However, among them, I found that 
M.H. Shakir renders backs as I have. The scenario in the narrative is that of a gathering of all humanity predating human life 
in this world. It sounds as though the progeny of Adam is being called forward from behind other children of Adam to bear 
witness against themselves, but God knows best.

2679. 7:187 [6], While I have rendered more simply than does he, I include Muhammad Asad's comment here for interest: The verb 
ahfa means "he did [a thing] in an excessive measure" or "he exceeded the usual bounds in doing [something]". In connection 
with an inquiry, and especially when followed by 'anhu or 'anha ("about it"), it signifies "he tried hard to gain insight [into 
something] by persistently inquiring about it". Thus, used as a participle, it means "one who has gained insight [into something] 
through persistent inquiry". In the above context, the implication is that no amount of inquiry or speculation can reveal to man - 
the prophets included - the coming of the Last Hour before its actual manifestation. 

2680. 7:187 [7], I refer the interested reader to that non-Qur’anic literature preferred by the Traditionalist to the Qur'an itself in 
which Muhammad is portrayed as a man with extensive knowledge on such questions.

2681. 7:189 [2]. The personal pronoun objects here are all feminine singular agreeing with the feminine noun nafs - soul. The 
word commonly translated as wife (zawj ) can refer to either a male or female and signifies something which makes up one 
half of a whole, a whole which itself is incomplete without the second half (such as a shoe, for example). 

2682. 7:189 [2], Arabic: sakana + ild - to be reassured by, trust in. Cf. 30:21.

2687. 7:189 [6], Arabic: s-l-h. This root is rendered by me as righteous or right throughout. However, it is unlikely (given how 
quickly they turn from God alone) that these parents would primarily be concerned with spiritual qualities. Clearly, the 
meaning is whole, healthy, right, properly formed, without defect, sound. This usage grants us some insight into the broader 
meaning of righteous as used in the Qur'an.

2697. 7:192 [2], I.e. people in general (such as those who ascribe a partnership as just evinced at 7:189-190). 

2698. 7:193 [1], To the Traditionalist the passage following treats of calling to false deities and the futility thereof. I disagree; 
rather, it comprises a taut argument and template for calling people to guidance. His confusion on this point arises due to a 
characteristic of Arabic usage. The verb to call in Arabic means both to summon and to supplicate. (In addition, where the 
verb is found with ila the sense is to invite, and I render thus throughout.) This in some part explains the Traditionalist's 
reading of 7:194 which he takes to be a challenge to the idolaters to supplicate to their false gods. It is, rather, an exhortation 
to the believers to invite others to guidance. The stages in the formula are: 1. invite them; 2. let them respond; 3. challenge 
them to do their worst while stating one's own faith in God and his law as one's only defence (i.e. lay down the gauntlet). The 
emphasis is on putting one's faith in God alone, in cutting ties with - and realising the futility of trusting in - anything other 
than God. I provide comments throughout to guide the reader through the passage and to draw his attention to salient 
points. 

2699. 7:193 [1], This is in the plural and does not address the messenger as in individual. The object of the Qur'an is not for you to 
join an organised religion, outsource responsibility for using your brain to people who can point to scant intellectual or 
cultural success in the last thousand years and thereby become a ‘Muslim'; rather, is to lead a life which is righteous and to 
call others to guidance. 

2700. 7:193 [1], I.e. those people who ascribe a partnership (as just evinced at 7:189-190).

heavily promoted ‘scientists', opinion-makers such as actors and other semi-fictitious personas) and all fiction-based belief 
systems, including most of what today passes for religion. 

2713. 7:196 [1], Lit.: the God. The point lost in English is that the Arabic noun for the eternal deity is the God ( allah ) - as a point of

fear cease not seeking protection in God (cf. 7:200).

2744. 8:1 [3], See note to 2:2. 

2745. 8:1 [5]. I.e. what God sent through his messenger. 

2746. 8:1 [6], Arabic: (al) mu’minun. See note to 8:2. See grammar note at 2:91. 

2747. 8:2 [1], Qur’anic definition: (al) mu'minun (sg.: mu'min) (haqqan) - the believers (in truth). The term al mu’minun is 
generally translated (which convention I follow) as the believers. The problem with the idea of belief in English is that it can 
be associated either with gullibility or with opinion based upon nothing concrete, or it invites the assumption that one who 
has it has something which defies any analysis. Happily, we have the Qur'an's definition of the term by which a believer - 
more specifically 'a believer in truth' - can identify himself as such to himself on the basis of set criteria as straightforwardly 
as can a mechanic or a nurse. Such people, then, have certain qualities: 1. Their hearts fear when God is remembered (i.e. 
mention of his punishments and the Day of Judgment) 2. The reading of God's proofs (i.e. scripture) increases them in faith 3. 
They place their trust in God 4. They uphold the duty (to serve him alone, seek help from him alone, and obey his laws) 5.

They spend out of what God gives them. The second half of this definition is found at 8:74 and it comprises: 6. Those who 
heed warning 7. Those who emigrate 8. Those who strive for the cause of God 9. Those who give shelter 10. Those who help. 
Thus the equation is quite simple. If a man has qualities 1 through 10 he is a believer in truth. This indicates that there are 
believers other than those who are believers in truth (as the segment 8:1-14 indicates, since - despite the fact that this 
insight has eluded the Traditionalist - al kafirun is a group which pertains to the believers, and found more generally inside 
the gate than outside it). However, if a man has none of these qualities (or is deficient in one or more of them) and has no 
desire to acquire them, he may be many things but a believer in truth is not one of them. It will be noted that the qualities 
which define a believer are not dependent upon (and in fact require no mention of) a religion of any stripe. All instances of 
the participle form of this verb which do not take a direct object are footnoted and reference this verse. 

2748. 8:2 [2], Arabic: ayat. See Article X. 

2749. 8:3 [1], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense it 
is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

2750. 8:4 [1], Arabic: (al) mu'minun. See note to 8:2.

expands upon each of the subjects mentioned in 8:1-4 (namely: what constitutes a true believer; those whose faith comes 
from hearing God's word; those who fear him and uphold their duty; and among whom are degrees of honour or 
achievement). This instance of kama [like, like as, as) is retrospectively referenced by idh [when) in that series of points 
which follows (8:6, 8:9, 8:11, 8:12, 8:30, 8:32, 8:42, 8:43, 8:44) the argument of which is brought to a set of conclusions and 
directives at 8:45-47, and followed by two more points (8:48, 8:49). The Traditionalist has some extraneous stories which he 
insinuates into the narrative by which means he hampers any serious study of the Qur'an and supplants its lessons with 
things other than that which God sent down.

2811. 8:35 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. Here it 
refers to those who are indifferent to warning (8:30). They are reproached since their duty consisted in nothing more than 
whistling and clapping (i.e. in forming an audience to hear out arguments concerning God) at that place at which by 
convention such questions were debated. (The site at Petra features a large Roman outdoor theatre capable of seating many 
hundreds of spectators.) However, the site at Petra is now closed to the believers (see 9:28 and Article XVIII). Refusing to 
listen does not make one free of culpability. 

2812. 8:35 [1], Arabic: bayt. The Traditionalist claims that this instance of the common noun bayt (house or household] indicates a 
special house of religious significance. That is not what the Qur'an says; but I cannot prove the Traditionalist wrong, so I give 
him the benefit of the doubt. I can provide hard evidence, however, that Makkah fails as the location for al masjid al haram 
(see Article XVIII), and on that basis I reject the box in that city so venerated by the Traditionalist as the possible subject of 
this verse. The verse treats of a former people, people for whom al masjid al haram was of religious significance. That time 
has now passed (see 9:28 and Article XVIII). In such a case all that remains to us is the principle moral lesson. 

2813. 8:36 [1], Arabic: alladhjna kafaru. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:6 and Article Il.i.

2834. 8:47 [2], Arabic: sadda - forsake, turn away from; to hinder, prevent, divert. A difficulty in correctly understanding this verb 
arises due to the fact that it has two applications, that is, it can mean both something one does oneself [to forsake - as in a 
person himself turns away from sin) or it can mean to divert (as in a person turns away another person from sin). Rather than 
rely upon the Traditionalist's erratic predilections, I follow a system based in common sense: where there exists a human 
object I treat the verb as transitive [he diverts his friend from the road); where there is no human object I treat the verb as per 
its other application [he forsakes the road). This common-sense approach fits all contexts and requires no interpolation

prohibited by treaty in this historical case.

as per my given methodology.

7:172).

in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social activity of 
any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual analysis of

2936. 9:17 [1], Arabic: ' amara. This form I verb occurs four times (9:17, 9:18, 30:9, 30:9); as a transitive verb it has two core 
senses: to maintain or to build, and to inhabit, fill with life or populate. Given a comparison of the instances, I believe the 
latter of these two basic range senses to be the correct one. I think the point in this context extends beyond that of the mere 
physical occupation of places of worship; rather, it is that such people are incapable of truly giving life to that place of 
worship of God found in the heart. All instances are footnoted and reference this verse.

2952. 9:25 [2], The only other instance of this root occurs at 19:13 ( hanan - sympathy, tenderness). The Traditionalist assigns the 
instance here at 9:25 the value of a proper noun (that of a name he claims for a specific valley near Makkah which he asserts 
as the name of the precise location of the battle described here). The attentive reader will already have noted the 
Traditionalist's habit of claiming implausible levels of specificity - ones which defy any sort of verification on the basis of the 
Qur’anic data - all of which tend towards a single end: to make him and his usurping literature the arbiter in the reading of 
God's revelation. Makkah as the locus for any portion of the Qur'anic narrative has been comprehensively dismissed (see 
Article XVIII and note to 9:28), so claims for a location of any kind in that vicinity may be safely ignored. The h-n-n root 
covers senses of longing, yearning, nostalgia, craving, desire. A plausible sense is - given a marking of hanayn rather than 
hunayn - is, perhaps, (two) desires-, meanwhile, Lane (p. 657) notes that the Arabs called a particular month hunayn (cf. 
ramaddn at 2:185). Since I cannot prove either case definitively, I have elected to leave the word untranslated.

2954. 9:26 [3], Arabic: alladhlna kafaru. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:6 and Article Il.i. 

2955. 9:26 [4], It is my understanding that this refers to the undesirable turn of events outlined at 9:25, a view which is supported 
at 9:27 also. It bears repeating that the term al kafirun does not apply exclusively to an external force of ‘unbelievers'; it is 
how the Qur'an identifies those who claim virtue but fail to meet its requirements. 

2956. 9:26 [4], Arabic: al kafirun. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. 

2957. 9:28 [1], Arabic: alladhlna amanu. Typically rendered those who believe. See 2:257 and Article II.iv.

2960. 9:28 [2], Arabic: al masjid al haram. See Article IX.ii. 

2961. 9:28 [2], The context is clear. It was their year because the idolaters had won the battle and taken al masjid al haram whereas 
the believers were shut out. The conclusion based on the reading here is inescapable: al masjid al haram is now closed to the 
believers. Its purpose was as a platform from which the messenger and the believers were to deliver the message of 
repentance to the One God; it was not to form a centre of ‘religion'. The centre of hajj which stands up to the light of 
objective, non-sectarian historical investigation was located at Petra, and that was destroyed by the earliest Muslims. The 
religion known as Islam was created later. See Article IX.ii.

2964. 9:29 [1], I.e. in the event that they fight you. Muhammad Asad comments here: Lit., [,.]ln accordance with the fundamental 
principle - observed throughout my interpretation of the Qur'an - that all of its statements and ordinances are mutually 
complementary and cannot, therefore, be correctly understood unless they are considered as parts of one integral whole, this 
verse, too must be read in the context of the clear-cut Quranic rule that war is permitted only in self-defence (see 2:190-194, and 
the corresponding notes). In other words, the above injunction to fight is relevant only in the event of aggression committed 
against the Muslim community or state, or in the presence of an unmistakable threat to its security: a view which has been 
shared by that great Islamic thinker, Muhammad 'Abduh. Commenting on this verse, he declared: "Fighting has been made 
obligatory in Islam only for the sake of defending the truth and its followers... All the campaigns of the Prophet were defensive in 
character: and so were the wars undertaken by the Companions in the earliest period [of Islam]" (Manor X, 332). 

2965. 9:29 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

2966. 9:29 [2], An attentive reading suggests that this clause is an allusion to 9:36-37. See Article XXIII.

2971. 9:29 [5], Lit.: give. 

2972. 9:29 [5], Arabic: jizyah - compensation, reparation, recompense. Other meanings were attached to this word as the Arab 
Muslims abandoned the Qur'anic injunctions against proportional taxation. Since this noun occurs once only it was an 
obvious candidate for later manipulations. See Article XXIII. 

2973. 9:29 [5], This is a moot point generally among the lexicons. The Traditionalist translators latch on to meanings which have 
evolved for political and historical reasons such as with a ready hand (meanings one fails to find on the page). Since it is the 
only instance in the text we can gain no further clues by means of comparison. The only clear guidance on this point comes

point which is supported at 9:36) that the underlying directive here is that the believers are to assist such people back to 
right doctrine, not to take war reparations from them. For more see Article XXIII.

2976. 9:30 [1], Cf. 5:18 in which both the Christians and Rabbinic Jews (neither of which groups would claim biologically to be sons 
of God) claim to be sons of God in the sense of preferred people or special ones of God. The word in the Arabic both here and 
at 5:18 is the same: the plural of 'ibn (and not of walad which in Qur'anic usage always denotes physical relationship). What 
is being referenced at 9:30 is the same quality as that claimed at 5:18, namely specialness, something which Christians claim 
for Christ and the Rabbinic Jews claim for ‘Uzayr (Ezra), a man whom they revere for ‘restoring' the Torah.

2996. 9:36 [1], Arabic: shahr - moon, month. 

2997. 9:36 [1], Apart from the explicit sense which is that God has set the number of moons (i.e. in a year), this also, perhaps, 
implies that we should be aware that God knows how many have passed and how many are yet to come. And given my 
reading of the Qur'an, it is significant from another point of view also: since fasting is a monthly requirement (and should be 
some number of days more than none), it would make sense for that which a believer gives from what God has given him 
(which also must be something more than nothing) to be given monthly. A month is a convenient unit by which man can plan 
to develop and grow; once we become attuned to the phases of the moon we gain a deeper relationship with time, becoming 
aware at the end of each moon that this block of time is now forever gone: the good and the evil thereof are, as it were, 
stored away (or amassed, to echo the preceding verse). However, this statement has another - and verifiable - significance, 
for which see Article XXIII. 

2998. 9:36 [2], Arabic: shahr - moon, month. For the count of moon (Arabic: shahr ) see Article XXIII. 

2999. 9:36 [2], Arabic: al kitab. See Article Xl.ii. 

3000. 9:36 [2], Arabic: kitab allah. See Article Xl.vi. For the count of in the law of God (Arabic:// kitab aiiah ) see Article XXIII. 

3001. 9:36 [3], For the count of day (Arabic: yawm) see Article XXIII. 

3002. 9:36 [3], For the count of created the heaven and the earth (Arabic: khalaqa al samawdtwa al ard] see Article XXIII. 

3003. 9:36 [4], My view is that the feminine object pronoun agrees with count ( 'idda) ; however, this is claimed by the Traditionalist 
to reference four moons. Even given the Traditionalist's reading, mention of idolaters later in the verse suggests a statement 
referencing 9:2; this would imply a particular pledge covering four months with particular idolaters in a particular year; 
certainly, there is no sense at 9:2 that the pledge mentioned there should hold up for all time - not even the Traditionalist 
claims that. The Traditionalist, however, somewhat predictably, claims a value here of four particular months with import 
extending beyond the local context, the details of which he claims to know. However, detailed analysis of this segment 
reveals a sense entirely different to that which the Traditionalist claims; see Article XXIII. 

3004. 9:36 [4], l.e. four things. See Article XXIII.

rendering as possible I would have omitted the second instance of altogether since the emphasis here is on equivalence of 
action. The believers are to meet aggression with a force proportionate to that ranged against them. 

3010. 9:36 [9], See note to 2:2. 

3011. 9:37 [1], Traditionalist claims regarding postponement include the notion that months were added or subtracted by idolaters 
(by which he understands Pagan Arabs) in order to make the lunar year closer to the solar year, and that it refers to the 
postponement of 'inviolable months' (which he takes to be specific months of ongoing import the details of which he claims 
to know, though he can point nowhere in the Qur'an for support) in order to facilitate further fighting. My view (which 
happened to agree in part with the assertions of some Traditionalists, though for reasons other than those which they 
provide) was that this statement indicates the postponement of moons (i.e. months) in order to make the lunar calendar 
concur with the solar calendar. However, detailed analysis of 9:36-37 has led me to review my position; see Article XXIII.

3025. 9:43 [2]. I understand this verse (and by implication those following) at an oblique angle to the Traditionalist. For him, the 
messenger is chided here for granting leave not to join the campaign. Saheeh International, for example, has it: [,..]why did 
you give them permission [to remain behind]? [You should not have] until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew 
[who were] the liars. The chiding tone which the Traditionalist correctly detects is actuated by a concern opposite to the one 
he assumes: it is that the messenger had granted leave to join the campaign to unworthy men. The focus of the passage is not 
to prevent those who wish to opt out from doing so. It is to get rid of such people as quickly as possible and prevent them 
from joining, but to do so on the basis of proper criteria - which is itself a practice with Qur'anic precedent (see 2:249-250). 
The attentive reader will find this analysis fully supported by the verses which follow, and confirmed at 9:83. 

3026. 9:44 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

3027. 9:44 [2], The statement which begins in the previous clause outlines how one is to discern those who should be allowed to

3050. 9:56 [3], Arabic: faraqa - to separate, part, divide, sever, sunder; fariqa - to be terrified; to be afraid. The commonest 
translations render the Arabic here afraid (and synonyms). There are reasonable grounds for so doing given what follows at 
9:57. However, to render likewise would mean that I should have to ignore the fact that the sense of this form I verb in all the 
other instances is to divide, to separate (2:50, 5:25, 17:106, 44:4). It goes against my methodology to admit occasional values 
for words for which there exist confirmed values, and I have stayed true to that principle here. 

3051. 9:57 [2], Arabic: jamaha - to bolt [horse]; to be refractory, unruly, recalcitrant; to be defiant; to be capricious, whimsical. Often 
(and usually) translated as run away, such a rendering misses the unifying value of the verb which is that of caprice and 
contrary wilfulness. The reading I have chosen fits better with the continuing context. This is the only instance of this root.

sole function as messenger was to convey the messages of God; outside of that function, he was a private person.

part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

3091. 9:71 [5], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

statement at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to 
acknowledge God's authority (see 7:172). The Traditionalist's values for salawat as a plurality of prescribed prayers (and by 
‘prayer' he means a series of standing, bowing, kneeling combined with the repetition of particular words) is clearly 
unsustainable here. That value which is discerned by comparison of all instances of salat makes perfect sense; the duties 
which were particular to the messenger were, evidently, known to him, and the reference here may reasonably be assumed, 
given the context, to indicate military matters.

3135. 9:103 [3], Arabic: s-l-w. I.e. to do such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salla means to 
perform (the or one’s) duty. Here the context indicates specifically the duty to treat appropriately those whose loyalty and 
commitment was previously in question but who then repented and contributed to the cause. The Traditionalist claims a 
value here of prayer (i.e. that the messenger prayed for such people). What the Traditionalist means by prayer wanders 
depending on what he wants to achieve. Here what he means by prayer is personal supplication or intercessory appeal to God. 
In other positions what he means is a highly ritualised process of liturgy and physical movements held to be beneficial to the 
practitioner and required by God (a process in which personal supplication or intercessory appeal to God may or may not 
feature). The speaker of English does not generally notice that a single English word is being applied by the Traditionalist so 
as to conflate two entirely different concepts. However, what is always the case - and what can be demonstrated on the basis 
of the Qur'anic text and the consistent usage therein - is that salat denotes duty, a fact which remains true no matter what 
specific value the Traditionalist claims for it in this or any other case. Clearly, the duty in this case is to take receipt of the 
charity (in a fitting manner) and acknowledge the repentance of those who give it - as confirmed both here and in the verse 
which follows. 

3136. 9:103 [4], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. In its 
primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement 
at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge 
God's authority (see 7:172).

circumstances in which war is permitted, see 2:190-194, 22:39, 60:8-9[...]. The reference to "those deniers of the truth who are 
near you" may arise from the fact that only "those who are near" can be dangerous in a physical sense or, alternatively, that - 
having come from afar - they have already approached the Muslim country with an aggressive intent. Meanwhile, Abdullah 
Yusuf Ali says: When conflict becomes inevitable, the first thing is to clear our surroundings of all evil, for it is only evil that we 
can rightly fight. To fight evil we must put up a stout and stiff resistance. Mealy-mouthed compromises are not right for soldiers 
of truth and righteousness. They are often a compound of cowardice, weariness, greed, and corruptibility.

3232. 10:22 [2], Lit.: are in or (under the influence of hatta idha) have been in. 

3233. 10:22 [2], Muhammad Asad's understanding here is predicated on dominant but erroneous assumptions regarding hatta 
idha - treating it merely as is standard today in Arabic rather than on the basis of a detailed study of the Qur'an's own 
employment of this collocation across the entirety of the Qur'anic text (see 3:152). This point notwithstanding, I reproduce 
his comment in full since the remainder of his point is of great merit: Lit., "until, when you are in the ships...", etc. As has been 
pointed out by Zamakhshari, the particle "until" (hatta) which precedes this clause refers to the sudden rise of the storm 
described in the sequence, and not to the "going to sea in ships". It is to be noted that at this point the discourse changes 
abruptly from the direct address "you" to the third person plural ("they"): a construction which is evidently meant to bring out 
the allegorical character of the subsequent narrative and to turn it into a lesson of general validity. 

3234. 10:22 [2], Instances where speech either trails off or is clipped through interruption are found at 2:138, 3:73, 6:143, 6:144,

treats of God's generosity, and the image conveyed in the present clause is that such people may rest assured that they need 
not fear stinginess or disgrace at the hand of God. This is an inverse statement; another way of saying the same thing is that

higher form of which is practiced by those above them. A point which the uninitiated find hard to grasp is that such people

which qiblah occurs outside of 2:142 and the verses immediately following. It is impossible for qiblah to mean at 10:87 what 
the Traditionalist ascribes to it at 2:142 (namely, a place towards which one turns in prayer). However, the meaning here - 
which is a fully acceptable value - fits both scenarios perfectly. This narrative refers, I suggest, to the night of the Passover. 

3347. 10:87 [3], Arabic: aqdma alsalat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). In this specific case one can reasonably argue that it denotes the duty binding upon the children of Isra'Il to keep the 
Passover (cf. Exodus 12).

["hamstringing"] gradually became synonymous with slaughtering in a cruel manner (Razi ; see also Lane V, 2107 f).

the one who had fear; but this is a moot point in terms of grammar. Saheeh International - which renders as have I - makes 
an interesting contribution in this regard: Traditionally, if a guest refused to eat, it meant that he harbored ill will toward the 
host or intended him harm ; cf. 51:28.

3486. 11:83 [1], Arabic: musawwama - branded, marked. This word is used at 3:14 with regard to horses to denote categories of 
excellence. In 1989, the amateur archaeologist and fundamentalist Christian, Ron Wyatt, announced that he had found the 
general location of the cities known in the Bible as Sodom and Gomorrah. Certain Christian groups make claims for the 
generality of Wyatt's work which are greater than the evidence he provides rightly allows. However, what is beyond question 
is that the areas he claimed for Sodom and Gomorrah contain regular, repeating lines perhaps indicative of human structures 
(albeit in a condition of severe decomposition), window-like apertures and plentiful evidence of a deluge of burning sulphur 
(brimstone). The sulphur was found to be 98% pure - a high level of purity. The Arabia Felix thesis claims a site for the same 
events. More investigation on the ground is required. See Article XVIII. 

3487. 11:83 [2], Arabic: zalimun. See 2:229. If Ron Wyatt is correct in his identification of the cities of Lut, then that location is only 
a day's ride from Petra. The Arabia Felix thesis claims a site for the same events. More investigation on the ground is

at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge 
God's authority (see 7:172). The Traditionalist has some work to do to square this value with his non-Qur'anic assertion that 
salat is equal to a daily prayer regime.

denote worship, that does not - and cannot - mean that all duty [salat] is worship. This is a simple point that evades the 
Traditionalist because he reads the Qur'an through the lens of the expectations implanted within him from hadith-, he does 
not see what there is, rather, he sees what he expects to find and shuts his eyes at what does not fit.

3544. 12:19 [2], Arabic: warid. This is the active participle of the w-r-d root the core meaning of which is to arrive. It occurs also at 
19:71 and 21:98 where it is rendered in keeping with the verb to arrive. It is something of a leap for a modern to make due to 
his disconnection from the pre-industrial world, but the arriver (as it were) here at 12:19 denotes water-drawer because it is 
that person whose duties comprise caring for animals upon arrival at a stopping-place. It is under the influence of this 
original reality that the w-r-d root has acquired connotations of watering-place and to water.

3547. 12:21 [1], Or (a) misr. This phrase has caused Traditionalist commentators (themselves locked into an extension of the 
Egypt-Palestine thesis) no end of problems since when misr is read as (the country) Egypt there is a disconnect given that the 
narrative is presumed to take place already within a given country (no matter how named) and the wording here clearly 
states from (a) misr (Arabic: min misr). The Arabia Felix thesis would claim this as a point in its favour. See note to 2:61 and

3560. 12:30 [2]. Arabic: ‘aziz - mighty, excellent; also denotes high-ranking dignitary. 

3561. 12:30 [3], Arabic: shaahafa - infatuate, enamour. These verbs in English are usually rendered in the passive voice and do not 
readily allow for direct objects in such a context. By rendering as I have, it has been possible to overcome these problems 
and convey something of the tension inherent in a context in which a houseboy possesses a form of mastery over his 
mistress. 

3562. 12:31 [2], Muhammad Asad notes the following: The expression muttaka'- lit., "a place where one reclines [while eating]", i.e., 
a "cushioned couch" - seems to have been used here tropically to denote a "luxurious [or "sumptuous"] repast". The reason, I 
must assume, that Asad regards this word 'tropically' rather than literally is because the literal reading does not fit with the 
dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis, which he inherited by default. Study of how well-to-do people took their food (i.e. sitting as 
per modern Western convention, or reclining as per Classical Roman and some Eastern conventions), might provide a minor 
proof point between those theses of which we are aware (see Article XVIII).

3563. 12:31 [6], The community among which Yusuf lives is cognisant of One God - a fact confirmed several times in the chapter. 
This presents a difficulty, I would suggest, for the Egypt-Palestine thesis (which places this narrative in ancient Egypt): there 
is no corresponding difficulty for either the ‘Aslr-Hejaz thesis or the Arabia Felix thesis, both of which presuppose a 
backdrop of historical iterations of monotheism (albeit one frequently found in decline or in diluted or corrupt condition).

clear example of how the Arabic language and lexicons have accommodated religious assumptions over time. There are 64 
instances of this noun in the text, yet for this one instance alone we are expected to accept a value which has no etymological 
connection with the root sense. The case is much simpler. The word, evidently, is immah (and is read by some as such; it is 
visually identical to ummah in the unadorned script). Arabic: immah - easy life, ease and enjoyment; plenty.

( J.j 5' My lord knows of their plan. 


3591. 12:49 [2]. Arabic: aahatha - to give abundant rain (here passive). Muhammad Asad who renders this verb 'to be delivered 
from distress' identifies the underlying problem in interpretation in his comment: Or: "will be granted rain" - depending on 
whether one connects the verbal form yughath with either of the infinitive nouns ghayth ("rain") or ghawth ("deliverance from 
distress"). Although the crops of Egypt depend entirely on the annual Nile floods, the water-level of the river is, in its turn, 
contingent upon the quantity of rainfall at its upper reaches. The problem which Asad here attempts to resolve (not 
convincingly in my view) is inherent under the Egypt-Palestine thesis - but not under the Arabia Felix thesis, for example, 
since Yemen's agriculture is directly dependent upon rain (see Article XVIII).

which - as the brothers would have seen it - was their right.

places the narrative in Egypt and correlates misr with ancient Egypt - a position which the Traditionalist supports) since 
those speaking are already physically present in the given country: the Arabia Felix thesis (wherein misr is taken in its 
original sense of trading station or citadel ) readily accommodates this statement and has Ya'qub and his sons leaving a rural, 
pastoral existence and entering a commercial, city-based one; the 'Aslr-Hejaz thesis proposed by Kamal Salibi connects the 
m-s-r root with an Arabian tribe. See Article XVIII.

3673. 13:7 [2], Arabic: lawld. See Article XVI. 

3674. 13:7 [4], It is a feature of Arabic that the verb to be is often implied rather than explicit. This is the case in other languages 
also, for example, Russian. Occasionally, this can give rise to ambiguity - which is the case here. The clause can mean either 
'Thou art but a Warner And for every people a guide’ or ‘Thou art but a Warner And for every people is a guide'. A. J. Arberry, for 
example, renders after the first option, and N. J. Dawood and Saheeh International after the second. I tend toward the second 
reading on the basis of the established facts that it is God who guides (cf. 2:272) and that God sends a messenger to every 
community (cf. 10:47,16:36).

3676. 13:11 [1], I.e. the archetypal person outlined in the previous verse. 

3677. 13:11 [1], Arabic: mu’aqqibat. The Traditionalist commonly claims this to refer to angels; while the sense indicates this to be 
the case, it neither says so explicitly not is it possible to connect the usage or verb root here with any instance which treats of 
angels. This word is the form II active participle of the verb ‘aqaba. The form II verb occurs at 27:10 and 28:31 where it 
means to return, to come back, to look again. The core root senses are: follow after (repeatedly)-, expose-, criticise. The active 
participle occurs in only one other instance (13:41). There the Traditionalist says it means critic or adjuster (of the decision 
of another). I agree with that value since it makes sense, agrees with the norms of the Arabic language and the context. The 
sense in the case here seems to be of a (repeated or relentless) questioning, investigation or examination (when one follows 
the narrative of 13:10 which treats of the futility of hiding anything from God). 

3678. 13:11 [1], I.e. before and after any Warner. Cf. 13:7. 

3679. 13:11 [2], I take this masculine pronoun object to reference qawl (saying ) in the previous verse.

but rather to cunning or scheming. What has happened, clearly, is that commentators have ascribed what they considered

15. And to God submits 3688 whoso is in the heavens

such values are at odds with the primary root senses. Translators attempt to get round this problem in different ways. 
Muhammad Asad explains his decision at this juncture thus: According to Raghib, the expression[...] (which occurs in the 
Qur'an only in this one place] signifies "powerful in contriving, in a manner hidden from man, that wherein wisdom lies". We see 
that Asad has made a noble attempt at rendering (or explaining away) what is on the page while bending the sense in a 
direction in keeping with his refined nature. I do not disagree with his analysis and have found it worthy of inclusion for 
interest. Despite this, I prefer to render more literally. 

3685. 13:14 [1], Arabic: al haqq. See Article XIX (al haqq i.). I.e. the kind of supplication one makes when the heart is utterly 
sincere - beyond all men's conceptions and pontifications about the nature of God - for example, when both engines on the 
plane you are in catch fire as you fly over the Andes, or you learn that your child has been picked up from school by an 
unauthorised stranger and is now missing.

3751. 13:43 [1], Arabic: alladhma kafaru. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:6 and Article Il.i. 

3752. 13:43 [3], The Traditionalist typically has it (or at least when he has inserted enough parenthetical statements of his own) 
that God is sufficient as witness between me and you And [so is] who has knowledge]..]. I reject this reading because I find the 
insinuation that God should need or accept further witness unacceptable on the basis of clear Qur'anic statements (e.g. 
4:166). Nor can it be that God is sufficient as witness between me and you And [between] whoso has knowledge]...] because the 
preposition baina is absent before whoso. However, the broader point begins at 13:41 and treats of a limit on what man can 
generally see (i.e. the vanishing point on the horizon due to the laws of perspective). Likewise, the points which follow are 
not readily accessible to the mass of men: 1. that God's judgment is always just; 2. that God brings his judgment swiftly: 3. 
that God is above all the scheming of which men are capable today or have been capable in the past; 4. that God knows the 
accounting for each soul; 5. that those who reject their creator today - and who may enjoy temporal prestige and power - 
will be brought low in the end and see who was right. The series concludes with a refutation of the validity of the 
messenger's mission by those who are indifferent to warning and a statement of God's witness to its veracity. It is my 
position that one who genuinely has knowledge of the law (i.e. the natural law God has given to men which is found in the 
Qur’an, in previous scriptures for millennia, and in the hearts of men) may be assumed to understand points 1 through 5, 
and that this fact is indicated by ellipsis - a device found many times in the Qur'an and one accepted by commentators of all 
times as a means the Qur'an employs to intimate or suggest a continuation or conclusion rather than state one blankly, often 
for reasons of tact, or to refrain from making binding upon men loads greater than some may be able bear.

plans. It thus both practices predictive programming (showing future events in the form of fiction to acclimatise the masses 
to such eventualities) and trains the herd to disregard its right moral interests; it renders the masses who acquiesce tacitly 
culpable thereby. The battle is for our souls; we can only justly be condemned if we have given - at some level - our approval 
to the Satanic agenda. And legally, silence connotes consent.

implies a call to what is good in the moral sense - is ultimately beneficent and enduring; and since a call to moral righteousness 
is the innermost purport of every one of God's messages, the term "good word" applies to them as well.

belief in "other powers" supposedly co-existent with Him (cf. verse 30 above). Inasmuch as this prayer implies a realization of, 
and gratitude for, God's infinite bounty, it connects directly with the preceding verse 34 and the subsequent verse 42.

3831. 15:17 [1], I include Muhammad Asad's comment here for broader perspective of the interested student: The term shaytan 
("satan") - derived from the verb shatana ["he was [or "became"] remote"] - often denotes in the Qur'an a force or influence 
remote from, and opposed to, all that is true and good [Taj al-'Arus, Raghib): thus, for instance, in 2:14 it is used to describe the 
evil impulses [shayatin) within the hearts of "those who are bent on denying the truth In its widest, abstract sense it denotes 
every "satanic force", i.e., every impulsion directed towards ends which are contrary to valid ethical postulates. In the present 
context, the phrase "every satanic force accursed [rajim]"- like the phrase "every rebellious (marid) satanic force" in a similar 
context in 37:7 - apparently refers to endeavours, strongly condemned in Islam, to divine the future by means of astrological 
speculations: hence the preceding reference to the skies and the stars. The statement that God has made the heavens "secure" 
against such satanic forces obviously implies that He has made it impossible for the latter to obtain, through astrology or what 
is popularly described as "occult sciences", any real knowledge of "that which is beyond the reach of human perception" [al- 
ghayb],

3835. 15:26 [2]. I agree to some extent with - and have based my rendering here upon that of - Muhammad Asad. While I reject 
the popular, heavily financed, resurrected ancient myth of Evolution (preferring instead the scientific method - namely 
something based upon verifiable evidence - over speculation, myth and the persecution of dissenters) Asad’s note at this 
point is reproduced here in full: There are many references in the Qur'an to man's having been "created out of clay [tin]" or 
"out of dust (turab)", both these terms signifying man's lowly biological origins as well as the fact that his body is composed of 
various organic and inorganic substances existing - in other combinations or in their elementary forms - on or in the earth. The 
term salsal, occurring in three verses of this surah as well as in 55:14, adds a further dimension to this concept. According to 
most of the philological authorities, it denotes "dried clay that emits a sound" (i.e., when it is struck): and since it is used in the 
Qur'an exclusively with reference to the creation of man, it seems to contain an allusion to the power of articulate speech which 
distinguishes man from all other animal species, as well as to the brittleness of his existence (cf. the expression "like pottery" in 
55:14). As the construction of the sentence shows, this salsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out ofhama' - which, according to 
some authorities, is the plural of ham’ah, signifying "dark, fetid mud" or "dark slime" - while the participial adjective masnun 
which qualifies this noun denotes, as Razi points out, both "altered" (i.e., in its composition) and "brought into shape": hence my 
rendering of this expression as "transmuted", which to some extent combines both of the above meanings. To my mind, we have 
here a description of the primeval biological environment out of which the "sounding clay" - the matrix, as it were - of man's 
physical body has evolved in accordance with God's plan of creation. 

3836. 15:27 [1], Arabic: jcmn - taken to be the singular of jinn. The root senses are of things hidden or concealed.

15:29 [2], Arabic: waqa’a. This verb has two key meanings in the text depending on the preposition it uses (for the full set of 
instances of this form I verb see 4:100, 7:31, 7:118, 7:134, 10:51, 15:29, 22:65, 27:82, 27:85, 38:72, 56:1, 69:15). As a rule, it 
means to occur, to befall. It is true (as per the Traditionalist's claim) that it also means to fall down. However, in this instance 
it is found with the preposition la. The Traditionalist wishes the reader to think that it means to fall down to him. The reason 
he wants this is that if he can get us to ascribe a purely physical value to the s-j-d root, he can begin to shoehorn his religion 
(i.e. inject something extraneous to the Qur'an while claiming it to be its natural corollary) into the mind of the reader on 
that basis. However, waqa’a does not normally take an object when it means to fall down and it does not take one with la 
except in its other sense of to befall (something befell him would take la before him). The verb sajada, however, does take la 
(see for example 22:18). The complete sense, then, is not: Fall down to him in submission. It is: Fall down, to him in 
submission. This scenario occurs at 15:29 and 38:72.

3844. 15:39 [2]. Perhaps an allusion to and an expression of contempt for that from which Man was taken. 

3845. 15:41 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: l.e., "this is what I have willed" - namely, that Iblis (or Satan] should tempt man, 
but should have no power to seduce those who are truly conscious of God. Thus, the Qur'an makes it clear that despite his 
ostensible "rebellion" against his Creator, Satan fulfils a definite function in God’s plan: he is the eternal tempter who enables 
man to exercise his God-given freedom of choice between good and evil and, thus, to become a being endowed with moral free 
will. My own sense is that this statement refers to the previous verse and that it is the state of being a pure-hearted servant 
of God which represents the straight path to God. 

3846. 15:42 [2]. Arabic: ahawln. the active participle from the verb ahawa. The same verb is used at 15:39. As an active participle

necessarily - as the city of the prophet. The Arabia Felix thesis can claim ancient trading routes and centres. Makkah can 
claim neither outside the closed system of hadith and related compositions, and appears on no map prior to 900 CE. See

83. But the blast took them in the morning 


3867. 15:78 [1], Arabic: al aykah means the woods or the forests. While it may be taken as the proper name of a place, I have 
observed that the use al ashaba (the companions ) as used throughout the Qur'an treats consistently in all unambiguous cases 
of general location (e.g. the fire, the garden, Hell), event (e.g. Sabbath), and once of person (Musa). It is interesting and 
perhaps significant that nowhere does the expression companions of the prophet or companions of Muhammad occur given 
that the Traditionalist's theology is built upon extrapolations and assumptions based upon a foundation of the same. The full 
set follows with ambiguous cases marked with asterisks: 2:39, 2:81, 2:82, 2:119, 2: 217, 2:257, 2:275, 3:116, 4:47, 5:10, 5:29,

25:24, 25:38*, 26:61, 26:176*, 35:6, 36:55, 38:13*, 39:8, 40:6, 40:43, 46:14, 46:16, 50:12*, 50:14*, 56:8, 56:8, 56:9, 56:9, 
56:27, 56:38, 56:41, 56:41, 56:90, 56:91, 57:19, 58:17, 59:20, 59:20, 59:20, 60:13, 64:10, 67:10, 67:11, 68:17, 74:31, 74:39, 
85:4, 90:18, 90:19. On the basis of such a preponderance of data, I have elected to assume that all ambiguous instances 
follow suit with the unambiguous cases; namely, that place names reference common nouns rather than specific place 
names. All instances bearing asterisks are footnoted and reference this verse. 

3868. 15:78 [1], Arabic: zalimun. See 2:229. 

3869. 15:79 [2], I.e. both cities mentioned. Grammar: dual. 

3870. 15:79 [2], I.e. that which guides or lies ahead - here: highway. Arabic: imam - leader, master, plumb line-, standard, criterion-, 
example, model. Cf. 75:5. 

3871. 15:80 [1], See note to 15:78. Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here: The Rocky Tract is undoubtedly a geographical name. On the 
maps of Arabia will be found a tract called the Hijr, north of Medina. Jabal Hijr is about 150 miles north of Medina. The tract 
would fall on the highway to Syria. This was the country of Thamood. If correct, this lends support to the thesis that the 
narrative takes place in the Nabataean region and not that of southern Hejaz. There is an archaeological site in northern 
Arabia under the auspices of UNESCO called Al-Hijr which is the largest site of the civilisation of the Nabataeans south of 
Petra and comprises houses hewn out of the rock face. This data fits neatly with the Petra thesis. However, the Arabia Felix 
thesis advances some claims for its locale in this regard. What is beyond question is that the Qur’an treats the history of the 
people of al hijr as something known to the initial recipients of the Qur'an. See also Article XVIII. 

3872. 15:81 [1], Arabic: ayat. See Article X.

3874. 15:85 [1], Arabic: bil haqqi. See Article XIX (bil haqqi ii.). 

3875. 15:87 [1], Arabic: mathani. The Traditionalist assumes this to mean the seven verses of alfatihah. This may or may not be 
correct. The root meanings of m-th-n are doubling, pairing and repetition. I have decided on pairing over repetition since I 
think the argument is stronger for it at the only other instance of this word (found at 39:23). However, the Traditionalist's 
position here has foundation. The seven verses of al fatihah are ‘oft-paired' with other portions of the Qur'an during his 
prayer regimen; that is: alfatihah will be read, then some other portion of the Qur'an. (There is no question that a system of 
prayers has been practiced since the inception of the Qur'anic revelation; it likely bears some resemblance to what is 
practiced today. What is rejected here on the basis of the Qur'anic data is the idea that any system of prayer - be it formalised 
or not - bears a one-to-one correlation with what the Qur'an calls salat, or that any particular method of prayer or worship 
devised by men can claim superiority over any other system of prayer which observes the principles of true monotheism and 
rejects all forms of idolatry; such a claim cannot properly be made for what Muslims take as their prayer in its current state 
in its entirety since it is punctuated by ‘aildhu akbari - a sentiment both absent from the Qur'an, and repugnant to its letter 
and spirit - and includes a stage in which blessings are invoked upon Muhammad, which practice is both close to 
necromancy and entails making what the Qur'an calls ‘a distinction among the messengers’, something we are instructed not 
to do.)

3876. 15:87 [2], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out. 

3877. 15:88 [1], Arabic: azwaj. This can also mean pairs, spouses; categories. Muhammad Asad comments here: The philological 
authorities are unanimous in that the plural noun azwaj denotes here "kinds" of people, or "some" of them, and not - as certain 
modern translators of the Qur'an have assumed - "pairs". 

3878. 15:88 [3], An expression which means: be gentle, compassionate.

3880. 15:91 [1], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out. 

3881. 15:91 [1], No-one has done as much to break the Qur'an into parts as the Traditionalist; it is his stock-in-trade. If one reads 
what he says the Qur'an means, one sees that the stories by means of which he ‘explains' the Qur'an serve only to break it 
into disjointed parts and prevent the reader from engaging with it with any consistency or fluidity. And by ascribing values 
to Qur'anic terms on a piecemeal basis in order to achieve predetermined goals - which is another characteristic of the 
Traditionalist's method - he is, likewise, effectively breaking the Qur'an into parts.

3933. 16:47 [1], I have followed Muhammad Asad here in both rendering and reasoning, and reproduce his note here in full: One of 
the meanings of takhawwuf is "gradual diminution" or "decay" or "slow destruction" (Lisan al-’Arab, art. khawafa; thus also 
Tabari and Zamakhshari); in the above context, the term has obviously both a social and a moral connotation: a gradual 
disintegration of all ethical values, of power, of civic cohesion, of happiness and, finally, of life itself.

3991. 16:101 [1], This is a continuation of verse 16:98 evidenced by id ha [when] in the introductions to both. 

3992. 16:101 [1], If one is to believe the Qur'an rather than the stories written down centuries afterwards which comprise the 
principle reading of those who claim the banner of a religion known as Islam, we find that the Qur'an itself was written 
down in full at the time of the revelation and that both the content and the ordering thereof are from God. On that basis one 
may reasonably conclude - in fact, must conclude - that as new revelation was sent down the text was added to, and sections 
inserted into the existing corpus, until such time as the revelation was complete. This, logically, is the process alluded to 
here. The messenger is told here to seek refuge with God at two times: when he recites the Qur'an (i.e. when he receives 
words from God which he repeats aloud) and when those words are placed in writing into the existing corpus. The 
surrounding context fully supports this assertion.

added to the corpus critics of the messenger accused him of fabrication.

4024. 16:124 [1], I understand this to indicate Sabbath and the sense to relate to those who say they follow Musa and those who 
say they follow Jesus (conflated with 'Isa; see Articles XVIII and XXI) and who observe Sabbath on different days. However, 
the object can also mean him. Muhammad Asad takes it in that sense, for example, and relates it to Ibrahim. While I am not 
persuaded by his argument, I include it for interest: The implication is that the majority of the Jews had deviated from the true 
creed of Abraham (which is the meaning of the phrase, "those who came to hold divergent views about him "] inasmuch as most 
of them became convinced that they were "God's chosen people" simply because of their physical descent from that great 
Prophet: an assumption which obviously runs counter to every truly religious principle. As the Qur'an repeatedly points out, this 
spiritual arrogance was punished by God's imposition on the children of Israel - and on them alone - of all manner of severe 
restrictions and rituals, of which the obligation to refrain from all work and even travel on the Sabbath was one. In its widest 
implication, this passage is meant to stress the fact that all God-imposed rituals are only a means towards the achievement of 
spiritual discipline, and never a religious goal in themselves.

4029. 17:1 [2], Arabic: al masjid al haram. See Article IX.ii and Article XVIII. 

4030. 17:1 [2], Arabic: al masjid al aqsa. See Article IX.iii and Article XVIII. The Traditionalist links this verse to a claim originating 
with the hadith literature wherein Muhammad is said to have entered the heavens and negotiated with God on the number 
of daily prayers. Such a claim puts one in mind of the Talmud, and I reject it as hearsay along with the rest of the 
Traditionalist's hearsay. Any suggestion that al masjid al aqsa means the mosque of that name in Jerusalem is obviously 
erroneous since no such building existed until after the Muslims took Jerusalem. The context here in the Qur'an suggests, 
perhaps, Musa rather than Muhammad as the subject in any case since Musa is the first person named in the segment; an 
assessment for which comparison with 27:8 suggests support. Within the Petra thesis - or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage 
thesis - one may reasonably suppose 17:1 to indicate a journey from al masjid al haram (in Petra) to Jabal al Lawz in Midian 
in the northern part of what today is Saudi Arabia near the border with Jordan about 120 miles away if one takes al masjid al 
aqsa to indicate that place Musa received the commandments and accepts Jabal al Lawz as its location; however, this is 
supposition, and God knows best.

4034. 17:3 [1], Translators try by various means to avoid what for me is the obvious conclusion that progeny here is an object of

4037. 17:4 [1], Arabic: alkitab. See Article Xl.ii. 

4038. 17:4 [2], In my opinion, the first of these was the creation of the Talmud and associated fictions (albeit in oral form since the 
Talmud was not written down until around the 4th century CE) by which means the Jews usurped the law and created moral 
abomination based on their imagined racial supremacy, the related reward for which was the destruction of the Temple and 
Jerusalem in 70 CE (history has been sanitised, but the reasons for the destruction of the Jerusalem included the financial 
perfidy of the Jews who used the Temple as a banking centre from which they inflicted ruin upon the world at large - a 
situation mirrored in part today). The second is a secular rehash of the former: the creation of Zionism and political and 
cultural Marxism. These latter movements, in combination with their supporting movements of fraudulent science, history, 
psychology and the perversion of the cultural narrative (media) are maintained by a tyranny of usury-based economics 
which together have made moral decline, depravity, and suffering the staple of those living in countries thus controlled 
(namely, any country with a central bank), and caused the deaths of many tens of millions of people in wars and 
persecutions created and fanned by those same interests. The goal, clearly, is the recreation of the Temple in Jerusalem - 
after which the Jews will again be brought low. Any people (be they Jews or not) who promote and benefit from pernicious 
and demoralising actions and die unrepentant while so doing - according to a plain reading of the Qur'anic narrative - are 
damned to Hell. Any hope of preferential treatment is consistently denied the Jews by the Qur'an, and personal 
responsibility for actions in this life stressed for all people, including Jews (see the first two clauses of 17:7 as an example). 

4039. 17:5 [1], The Romans plundered Jerusalem.

11. And man calls for evil by his call for good. 


4042. 17:8 [2]. The tenor of this second section places the responsibility for the choice for what happens squarely on the people 

concerned. The Jews have a high calling. Contrary to the tenets of Talmudism and Zionism, that calling is not that of master 

race; Jews were intended to be witnesses to - and teachers of - the Torah (the foolishness called the Noahide Laws is an 
invention of their own). The Qur’an exhorts the Jews to remember their calling and to abide by it. I tend to believe that the 
original Torah exists somewhere - or at least existed at the time of the Qur’anic revelation. In its present state, the Torah 
promotes the idea of Jewish supremacy - a concept both odious and ludicrous given Jews’ singular lack of generative 
achievement - and places common Jewry in a position which defines them in terms of the conflict their premises necessitate. 
The Qur'an is clear: those of the Jews who abandon their calling are cursed. God is not arbitrary. When God curses a people 
he gives them the means by which to condemn themselves, which fact explains much that we see in the world. Yet, if the Jews 
were to stop creating corruption in the earth and return to God, he would return to them. However, that door remains open 
only up to a point, after which it is too late. Certainly, not all Jews are corrupt - and the Qur'an does not claim that they are - 
however, communities are judged on the aggregate of their output, and there exists no special treatment for Jews in that 
regard.

13. And every man, we have attached his fate 4053 to 
his neck. 4054 


4047. 17:11 [2]. Evil is always packaged as good; the manifesto of every evil agenda reads as the embodiment of virtue. Few are the 
men who take the time to do due diligence on what they accept. Notwithstanding, we are judged on the basis of what we do, 
in fact, accept and act upon. See 17:36. 

4048. 17:12 [1], Arabic: aya - here dual. See Article X. 

4049. 17:12 [2], Arabic: aya. See Article X. 

4050. 17:12 [3], Arabic: aya. See Article X. 

4051. 17:12 [5], I.e. of days. 

4052. 17:12 [6], Arabic: fassala - to set out (that is, present in a logical order, categorise ) and to make plain or detail. 

4053. 17:13 [1], Or omen. 

4054. 17:13 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The word ta'ir literally signifies a "bird" or, more properly, a "flying creature". 
Since the pre-lslamic Arabs often endeavoured to establish a good or bad omen and, in general, to foretell the future from the 
manner and direction in which birds would fly, the term ta'ir came to be tropically used in the sense of "fortune", both good and 
evil, or "destiny'f...] It should, however, be borne in mind that the Qur'anic concept of "destiny" relates not so much to the 
external circumstances of and events in man's life as, rather, to the direction which this life takes in result of one's moral choices: 
in other words, it relates to man's spiritual fate - and this, in its turn, depends - as the Qur'an so often points out - on a person's 
inclinations, attitudes and conscious actions (including self-restraint from morally bad actions or, alternatively, a deliberate 
omission of good actions). Hence, man's spiritual fate depends on himself and is inseparably linked with the whole tenor of his 
personality: and since it is God who has made man responsible for his behaviour on earth, He speaks of Himself as having "tied 
every human being's destiny to his neck". This opinion is fully supported by the verses which follow.

light editing: This highly elliptic sentence has a fundamental bearing on the purport of the Qur'an as a whole. In many places 
the Qur'an stresses the fact that the Prophet Muhammad[...] was not empowered to perform miracles similar to those with 
which the earlier prophets are said to have reinforced their verbal messages. His only miracle was and is the Qur'an itself - a 
message perfect in its lucidity and ethical comprehensiveness, destined for all times and all stages of human development, 
addressed not merely to the feelings but also to the minds of men, open to everyone, whatever his race or social environment,

and bound to remain unchanged forever. Since the earlier prophets invariably appealed to their own community and their own 
time alone, their teachings were, of necessity, circumscribed by the social and intellectual conditions of that particular 
community and time; and since the people to whom they addressed themselves had not yet reached the stage of independent 
thinking, those prophets stood in need of symbolic portents or miraclesf.] in order to make the people concerned realize the 
inner truth of their mission. The message of the Qur'an, on the other hand, was revealed at a time when mankind (and, in 
particular, that part of it which inhabited the regions marked by the earlier, Judaeo-Christian religious development) had 
reached a degree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to grasp an ideology as such without the aid of those persuasive 
portents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past, as the above verse points out, only too often gave rise to new, grave 
misconceptions.

4121. 17:78 [1], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). The purport here, naturally, is construed by the Traditionalist in accordance with a pre-existing expectation of a 
‘prayer’ regimen. The context, perhaps, fits better an obligation to warn by means of the Qur'an; see Article XXIV (cf. 50:40, 
68:42,68:43). 

4122. 17:78 [1], Arabic: duluk. The primary meaning of the verb from which this noun derives is to rub or to press or to squeeze 

(often: until things merge). It signifies that time at which the sun seems to merge with the land as it passes into that 
vanishing point which is a function of the laws of perspective which - given no intervening barriers to vision - form the land 

or water horizon (which is that place where all things likewise vanish unless a contraction of distance is simulated by means 

of a lens). 

4123. 17:78 [2], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out. 

4124. 17:78 [3], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out. 

4125. 17:78 [3], Cf. 11:114.

means chins. At 36:8 it means chins - a point uncontested by the Traditionalist who renders there thus himself. Here, 
however, he is very eager to impress upon the mind some connection with his externally derived prayer regimen and so 
would have the reader believe that fall on their faces is the value. But it is not. It says fall down to the chins. It does not even 
say fall down to their chins but: fall down to the chins. Thus to the chins is an adverbial modifier describing how 'they' fall 
down. I do not believe that it is possible to fall down to the chins physically - at least not with any degree of naturalness or 
spontaneity. I am compelled therefore to regard to the chins as a non-physical (i.e. metaphorical) adverbial modifier (cf. 
English up to one’s neck ) and take it to mean without reservation, completely, most earnestly.

4175. 18:4 [1], It is perhaps significant that the calumny brought by many Christians over the centuries against God is mentioned 
at this point, just prior to the story of the companions of the cave (or The Seven Sleepers as Christian sources put it). Modern 
Christians typically have the impression that all early Christians were Trinitarians, but this is simply not the case. The first 
Christians were Jews, and Jews, properly speaking, are uncompromising monotheists. (The idea of Trinitarianism triumphed 
only at the Council of Nicaea in 325 under the direction of a sun-worshipping pagan tyrant who wanted to agree a creed 
which would be acceptable also to other pagans.) There certainly exists a similar story in a cave featuring Christians and set 
in Ephesus which predates the Qur'an. The fact that the Qur'an features stories which were previously known is presented

by its detractors as grounds to question its veracity or to accuse it of imitation. Such a position gains some traction over 
ignorant and inattentive audiences. However, the fact is that the Qur'an rehearses (and corrects) a wide range of narratives 
as part of its modus opercmdi. If one can fault the arguments or the facts, that is one thing. But to criticise a message which 
itself states that it repeats and corrects known accounts - for doing exactly that - is a cheap shot designed to give audiences 
which are unlikely ever to consider the Qur'an's arguments in context the impression that they have reliable grounds to 
disregard the Qur'anic revelation in toto. Where the Qur'an performs this function it often states as much, as here at 18:13 - 
We narrate to thee their report aright. The implication is that other reports exist and are incorrect and that this one states 
things correctly. Any suggestion that the subjects of the current story were Trinitarian Christians is also implicitly corrected 
by the Qur'an. 

4176. 18:6 [1], I.e. in the wake of those who subscribe to the lie about God outlined above. 

4177. 18:6 [1], See note to 58:4 for Qur'anic usage of to believe in. 

4178. 18:6 [1], Arabic: hadith - story; account; narrative, statement. I concur with Muhammad Asad's reasoning on this point and 
include his comment here in full: Lit., "it may well be that thou wilt...", etc. However, the particle la 'alia does not, in this context, 
indicate a possibility but, rather, a rhetorical question implying a reproach for the attitude referred to (Maraghl XIII, 116).

faith and good works; and to the condition of the earth at the end of time). 

4180. 18:9 [1], Arabic: am. See note to 21:21. 

4181. 18:9 [2], Arabic: al raqtm - the inscription, the writing. This word occurs only once. Some take it as a common noun (i.e. the 
inscription), others as a geographical name, and yet others - somewhat surprisingly - as the name of the dog. My sense is 
that it refers to the story of the companions of the cave as a written document. If you can supply genuine historical or 
etymological data on this point, please let me know. 

4182. 18:9 [3], I.e. if thou think that this narrative beggars belief.

Petra is liberally peppered with caves. See Article XVIII. 

4184. 18:10 [2], Arabic: amr - (here) affair, also matter; command. It pays to be aware of this word as we go through the story of 
the companions of the cave since it serves as a marker to help the reader properly track what is being said and by whom.

4189. 18:14 [1], That is, they stood up before the people among whom they lived and did what all those who truly follow God are 
called upon (as per the Qur'anic imperative) to do: they called men to God alone (not to religions or other man-made 
mechanisms of control).

exactly as I do here (and as I do all instances where this construction occurs). 

4196. 18:16 [1], This anticipates the time when the companions of the cave should withdraw having warned the erring people. 

4197. 18:16 [4], Here again affair serves as a marker to clarify who is the subject throughout the narrative - namely the 
companions of the cave (see 18:10).

4202. 18:18 [2], I have rendered this clause and that preceding literally. Most translators render in a more conditional mood ( thou 
wouldst have thought them awake[...f). However, the plain reading is as I have rendered. I think this is a parenthetical aside 
which treats of the present: though thou think those around you awake, they are, in fact, asleep.

4204. 18:19 [6], Arabic: waraq. Typically translated silver coin. I fail to find any support for silver. The original sense of waraq is 
leaf (of a tree and thence of paper or note of money). It also means strip of metal. I think money is the safest of the possible 
options.

4205. 18:21 [l].I.e. God. 

4206. 18:21 [1], Arabic: a'thara. The Traditionalist renders this verb contrary to the requirements of Arabic, a point conceded 
indirectly by the lexicographer Lane ( Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 2004) who describes the second object as 'suppressed'. This 
is academic language for ‘missing and ignored for reasons of convenience'. Such a dead end may be sufficient for those who 
merely want to learn what others have thought but not for those who want to think for themselves. The facts are as follows: 
the form IV of the verb a'thara + ‘ala means to acquaint, to make come across and requires two objects (i.e. x withy). (If the 
interested reader compares a few sectarian and non-sectarian translations he will see how the translators struggle with this 
clause, resorting to fudging, interpolation and creative writing of their own; where the translators bite the bullet of their 
assumptions the resulting construction makes no sense and leaves an object unfulfilled. To illustrate, here is a sentence in 
English which has the same problem: we thought about. There is an obvious unmet requirement here. Popular renderings of 
the clause in question have the same type of problem.) The case is quite simple once we own the point which the 
Traditionalist is unable to grasp which is that the speaker here has not changed to God [And thus did we[...]). It remains the 
companions of the cave (which should come as no surprise since we are told at 18:19 that the focus of the story is the debate 
between the companions of the cave). The verb, then, is not in the first person plural (we), it is in the third person masculine 
singular (he) taking a first person plural object nd ( us ) then the preposition 'ala and the second object them. The 
companions of the cave are stating the reason why God acquainted them with the people of the town. In his haste to create a 
religion based on later fictions, the Traditionalist has lost - or perhaps did not wish to retain - the point of the Qur'anic 
narrative which is that we, the believers, are meant to warn those around us. It is not a job for commissioned messengers 
and prophets only: such a task is what following a messenger of God entails. The companions of the cave were simply doing 
their job; and their story concentrates on the post-op review in the cave. 

4207. 18:21 [2], I.e. the people to whom companions of the cave witnessed (see 18:14). 

4208. 18:21 [2], Arabic: haqqun. See Article XIX (haqq- vi).

Guessing at the unseen. 


4209. 18:21 [4], This, perhaps, also refers back to the initial when in this story at 18:10 confirming that this is a continuation of 
that story given to correct the assumption introduced at 18:9. On a related point, one needs to develop a sense of the 
shorthand and logistics the Qur'an employs. To use screenwriting terminology, what we have here is the payoff for the setup 
at 18:19 (when the companions of the cave send one of their number with money to buy food). That person has now, 
evidently, returned with news of what has transpired on the ground while they were asleep. We are left to fill in the details. 
The executive version is this: they have been in stasis for three centuries; everyone who persecuted them (and by extension, 
all the members of their personal families along with everyone else they knew) is now long dead, and they are living in a 
completely different era. Put yourself in their shoes: if you woke up one day and someone in your house went to the shops 
and came back with a similar piece of news, would that not cause voices to be raised? 

4210. 18:21 [4], I.e. the companions of the cave. 

4211. 18:21 [4], Here again affair serves as a marker to identify the subject throughout the narrative: the companions of the cave 
(see 18:10). The Traditionalist here switches affair to reference the people of city and is, in general, lost in his understanding 
of the entire passage. 

4212. 18:21 [5]. I.e. over those who perished. The argument here is in favour of a monument or memorial building of some type. 

4213. 18:21 [7], The victors in the debate conclude that they will take a masjidfor (i.e. in payment for) them. The Qur'anic usage of 
the Arabic here demonstrates the exact construction which occurs just once more in the text (at the end of 18:77) where 
take (in payment) for is unquestionably the sense. Interestingly, a Christian church was built at Petra in 450 CE. 

4214. 18:21 [7], Arabic: masjid, masajid. See Article IX.i. 

4215. 18:22 [1], I.e. those who speculate without knowledge.

4216. 18:22 [4], This, incidentally, is the number ascribed by early Christians. 

4217. 18:22 [5]. Given the statement at 18:25 there is a case to be made that this refers to the number of years the companions of 
the cave slept rather than the number of individual youths, but God knows best. 

4218. 18:22 [7], I.e. one based in and limited to what God has given. The facts are these: a population fell into idolatry: young men 
of faith refused to go along with that idolatry and stood up and witnessed to the truth of the One God and were rejected; God 
protected the young men in a cave for three centuries; the young men awoke to find that God had destroyed the former 
population; the young men discovered what had transpired and discussed how best they should respond; one party argued 
that they should build a monument to those who had perished; a second party argued that they should take a masjid (place 
of worship) as payment for the people of the community to which they witnessed (and sent to their lord apprised of the 
truth). 

4219. 18:22 [8], The Qur'an is completely clear: we are to limit our information about this question to facts (which, for us, means 
what we have in the Qur’an). 

4220. 18:24 [1], Surely, the point of this aside is that one should anticipate that he, like the companions of the cave, if he would 
serve God and do what is required (namely, warn with the revelation the erring culture around him), may also sleep for an 
unnaturally long time, or be taken to his lord in death - which is why it is advisable to anticipate such an eventuality by 
referencing God's will as part of formulating any future plans.

4309. 18:86 [2], Objections are sometimes raised against this statement which rest upon on an assumption that the Qur'an claims 
that the sun (itself) set in a murky spring. Firstly, the meaning of the verb aharaba as to set (of the sun) does not correlate 
with what to set means in English; aharaba means to go away, to depart, to leave, to withdraw and the sense of to set with 
regard to the sun is a function of this primary meaning. Secondly, the scenario is plain enough: Dhu'l-Qarnayn found the 
departure of the sun when he (i.e. Dhu'l-Qarnayn) was in a murky spring, and (then) he (Dhu'l-Qarnayn) found a people 
nearby. Cf. 18:90.

4317. 18:91 [1], The word kadhalika means thus and occurs many times in the Qur'an. In the vast majority of cases it fits perfectly 
within the narrative. However, I noticed that in a small number of cases it neither fits fully syntactically nor has any obvious 
function. The translators struggle to accommodate it in such cases by ignoring it, twisting it, or inserting words of their own 
choosing to form a non-existent and non-functioning thought such as: thus [it was] or thus [it came to pass], treating the 
reader to the literary equivalent of ho-hum or well then - certainly not representative of the terse and compact vitality which 
one experiences with the Qur'an. I reviewed and listed every instance of kadhalika and identified those cases in which they 
'hang' (or seem lost or disjointed from the context). That process rendered a set comprising: 18:91, 26:59, 44:28, 44:54. (The 
reader is encouraged to look at and compare a number of translations to see how the translators wrestle to make the word 
fit; where they deal with it honestly it lies there like a second spare tyre next to a car.) Having identified the set, I read the 
surrounding context for each and found that they all treat of the same topic: security in and inheritance or possession of land 
or kingdom. In order: 18:91 treats of Dhu'l-Qarnayn who encounters a people who have nothing but the sun above their 
heads (they have neither security nor possession of the land) and in the next verse the narrative turns to the story of Ya'juj 
and Ma'juj due to whom those he encounters are unable to live unmolested in the land - which condition he remedies (they 
possess a land but have not security - although they gain it); at 26:59 the children of Isra'Il inherit 'treasures and a noble 
station' and are delivered through the sea (leaving behind slavery and tyranny) while those who oppressed them are 
destroyed (they had neither security nor possession but they gain both along with inheritance): 44:28 treats of Fir'awn and 
his people and lists the good that they had before stating: '[...[we gave it as an inheritance to another people' and '[...[the sky 
and the earth wept not for them and they have no respite]...]' (they had both security and possession but lost everything and 
utterly failed in the end): the final instance is found at 44:54 and treats of those of prudent fear and sits in the middle of 
44:51-57, a passage which describes the bliss of the garden where the inhabitants are 'in a secure station' and will 'not taste 
death therein save the first death]..]’ - a passage which itself follows on from and stands in stark contradistinction to a 
description of the fate of the inhabitants of Hell (they have the supreme security and possession and can never lose it). Given 
the totality of the above facts, I must regard these 'extra' kadhalikas as having logistical as well as semantic functions, 
operating with a function similar to kalla (see 74:16) as pan-textual markers which draw together points spread across the 
broader narrative - a fact which indicates that their surrounding contexts should be read and considered together. In my 
view and experience, in the case of the hanging kadhalika one should read from each to the end of the respective chapters:

the two instances in chapter 44 complete the set. In addition, given what we now know, the statement immediately following 
the first instance of this kadhdlika set at 18:91 takes on an entirely different aspect. Translators struggle to dispatch this 
instance with conviction because they (quite reasonably) assume it treats of DhuT-Qarnayn and when understood as such it 
means, frankly, nothing - or at least nothing we can do anything with. However, it fits perfectly into the model just outlined. 
Saheeh International renders the clause: 'And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.' The Arabic rendered here 
he had is ladaihi which means (in the context) he has (or he had) with him or near him is (or was). The case is now clear that 
the statement refers not to DhuT-Qarnayn but to the use of the hanging kadhdlika: And we have encompassed all that it [i.e.

4325. 18:96 [2], Arabic: hatta idha. See 3:152. 

4326. 18:96 [2], Arabic: sadaf- shell, conch, visible part of the ear. There is no justification that I could find for the Traditionalist 
translations here using mountains and synonyms. This noun occurs only once, a fact which makes it vulnerable to abuse for 
the usual reasons. The verb form occurs at 6:46, 6:157, 6:157, 6:157 and means to turn away. The story here, as commonly 
understood, is that a wall was built between two mountains to keep Ya'juj and Ma'juj at bay. But that is not what the text says. 
It is yet another case of ideology driving interpretation. There are strong, verified words for mountain in the Qur'an and 
sadaf is not one of them; it also makes no sense with such a value in the context from the point of view of common sense. If a 
wall is erected across a valley and there is exists a compelling reason to get past it, it is a simple matter to climb up one side 
of the mountain and down the other side of the barrier. I do not believe this is what is described here. The preceding 
language concerns building a dam, filling until making level and pouring. This does not sound like building upwards, rather 
blocking downwards or inwards. My thesis is this: Ya'juj and Ma'juj were cave-dwellers and DhuT-Oarnavn is blocking the 
entrance to their subterranean domain. In such a scenario sadaf bears a reasonable correlation to the action in both its noun 
and verb aspects. The verb means to turn away, which is what cave-dwellers have traditionally done with regard to the 
world. The noun's meanings have in common the concept of an aperture or opening which serves as an entrance to something 
which itself burrows into the inner parts of a thing. On this basis, I believe that opening is the right interpretation here. In this 
scenario, DhuT-Oarnavn is not simply building a wall between one faction and another. He is sealing Ya'juj and Ma'juj alive 
into a mass tomb. On this basis verses 18:98-99 make sense also. Creative eschatological myths concerning the Ya'juj and 
Ma'juj are now superfluous - at least on any Qur'anic basis. The point Dhu'l-Oarnavn is making is that the tomb they have 
created for Ya'juj and Ma'juj will not withstand the end of the world and that Ya'juj and Ma'juj, like every other creature, will 
be brought forth for judgment; he is simply putting the work of his hands into right context with respect to the power and 
judgment of God.

to say more than what is in the Qur'an, he would have done so. Adding to the words of God albeit - or, perhaps, especially -

at 19:12 since those historical figures who follow also held fast the law (i.e. that collection of decrees, ordinances and rules 
which makes up the moral and physical law of the universe, of which the laws which God has given men form a part). In each 
case the Qur’an either corrects misconceptions about - and calumnies levelled against - servants of God, or emphasises the 
receipt, transmission, clarification of - or adherence to - the law, either directly or with reference to prophets. The chapter 
also features two instances of the pan-textual marker no indeed! [kalld) - for notes on which see 74:16 - the core focus of 
which mechanism is the vanity and loss to which men will be subject if they continue heedless of God’s lordship and law. See

mean pretending to be dumb and physically unable to speak; nor does it mean that explaining in simple terms that one is

and some translators render here according to this meaning. The second meaning deals with names and naming (principally, 
namesake or one of like name). Since the usage here echoes that at 19:7 and given that the present verse opens with a great 
name of God, my opinion is that the latter option is the correct one. The student should know that the root noun ism (name) 
has connotations of authority also.

to submit to any absolute moral imperatives and is determined to obey the dictates of expediency alone. In such a social order, 
material success and power are usually seen as consequences of a more or less conscious rejection of all metaphysical 
considerations - and, in particular, of all that is comprised in the concept of God-willed standards of morality - on the 
assumption that they are but an obstacle in the path of man's free, unlimited "developmentIt goes without saying that this 
attitude (which has reached its epitome in the modern statement that ''religion is opium for the people") is diametrically 
opposed to the demand, voiced by every higher religion, that man's social life, if it is to be a truly "good" life, must be 
subordinated to definite ethical principles and restraints. By their very nature, these restraints inhibit the unprincipled power- 
drive which dominates the more materialistic societies and enables them to achieve - without regard to the damage done to 
others and, spiritually, to themselves - outward comforts and positions of strength in the shortest possible time: but precisely 
because they do act as a brake on man’s selfishness and power-hunger, it is these moral considerations and restraints - and they 
alone - that can free a community from the interminable, self-destructive inner tensions and frustrations to which materialistic 
societies are subject, and thus bring about a more enduring, because more organic, state of social well-being[...].

4450. 19:91 [1], Often translated ascribe, such a rendering loses the connotation which is clear in the Arabic. The verb da’a means 
to call (out) to (in all senses, including to supplicate ) and is rendered accordingly throughout. Under the influence of the 
preposition // there is a sense of imparting (which is why ascribe is often the value chosen by translators). However, what is 
missing from such a rendering and what is present in the Arabic, in my view, is an allusion to the Trinitarian Christian 
practice of calling upon God in the name of his ‘son'.

4456. 19:96 [3], The Qur'an speaks sparingly of the love of God for his servants. It is interesting that one such instance should 
occur in a context which treats of Trinitarian Christian assertions - given the excessive and unwarranted emphasis many 
Christians place on the love of God. This verse clarifies for them (and for all mankind) how God's love is accessed. One needs 
to heed warning (i.e. have faith in the message) and do works of righteousness. In this case - and in this case alone - the 
Almighty appoints love for us. The doctrine of eternal salvation by means of a ‘salvation prayer' nowhere found in the 
Christians' own texts not only fails to find support in the Qur'an, supplications of any kind directed to anyone other than 
God - or to God under the auspices of another authority - gain no purchase in the Qur'an. Clearly, Christians pray on a 
variety of bases and appear at times to achieve much with their prayers. However, this should not blind us to Jesus' own 
comments regarding some who would do ‘wonderful works’ in his name - a reflective reading of which suggests that the 
results of prayers on that basis are alone not a confirmation of acceptance with God. The Qur'an tells us that God will clarify 
things for all - including Christians - on the Day of Judgment, and that they will continue to differ among themselves until 
then. Those who read and accept the Qur'an are not to adopt what it calls the 'vain desires’ of previous communities 
( 2 : 120 - 121 ). 

4457. 19:97 [1], I.e. the revelation of the Qur'an. 

4458. 19:97 [1], This seems to me to have a secondary implication of simplify, make accessible.

favour of it indicating twice (from tuwan), as he says: i.e., "twice-hallowed" - apparently because God’s voice was heard in it 
and because Moses was raised there to prophethood.

it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see

4600. 20:128 [1], While this may serve as potential support for Petra (either simply as the location of pilgrimage or also as the city

4603. 20:130 [2], Arabic: s-b-h. See 2:32. A point entirely missed by the Traditionalist is that this imperative treats of the 
messenger, a man who is exhorted 'be thou patient over what they say’-, whatever 'give thou glory with the praise of thy lord' 
means (naturally, the Traditionalist claims it in favour of his predetermined rituals) the reason for it is unambiguous: 'that 
thou mightest be satisfied’. The scenario is not of a closed-system religion in which a man lives how he likes in compromise 
with the world and keeps to an unrelated private prayer system as a form of time tax paid to God; rather, it is of a man 
seeking and receiving the strength he needs to sustain him in the process of delivering the message of warning God has 
entrusted to him to a deaf, ignorant and derisive world.

4605. 20:130 [6], [,..]the two ends of the day can only logically refer to dawn and dusk despite the mental contortions the 
Traditionalist would have one accept; that being the case, this imperative simply expands on and reiterates the one above. 

4606. 20:131 [1], Arabic: azwaj. This can also mean pairs, spouses; categories. Muhammad Asad comments: The philological 
authorities are unanimous in that the plural noun azwaj denotes here "kinds" of people, or "some" of them, and not - as certain 
modern translators of the Qur'an have assumed - "pairs". 

4607. 20:131 [2], See note on fitnah to 2:102. 

4608. 20:132 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. (to uphold such) duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense it is 
the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). In my view, in the context salat may refer to the duty to keep the life to come in right perspective and not to become 
disproportionately attached to the life of this world or to the duty to warn the world to turn to God alone.

what pretends to be science, education and entertainment is now weaponised to such a degree that it can rightly be called by

4621. 21:5 [1], Arabic: bal. See note to 2:88. This verse presents three of the commonest arguments against the Qur'an: 1. That the 
Qur'an is a disjointed narrative which makes no sense. 2. That Muhammad invented it. 3. That Muhammad was a poet. Some 
chapters have what I call characteristic mechanisms; that is, they use turns of phrase or particular words or constructions in 
ways which invite attention. In this case, the characteristic mechanism is the use of bal (rendered variously as per the note at 
2:88, and here as But:); whereas the chapter begins with rejections and refutations advanced by those who mock and reject 
the messenger, this turns into rejections and refutations of them by God - of which process bal is the marker, and occurs 12 
times.

4628. 21:10 [1], Arabic: dhikr- calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. The Qur'an certainly 
contains the history of the community of the prophet; however, those who came afterwards ascribed subjective and spurious 
values to certain key terms in that history in order to generate a religion nowhere found in the Qur’an, which process has 
hamstrung Muslims intellectually and culturally and reduced them to the condition in which one sees them today.

4637. 21:21 [1], Arabic: am. This is the Arabic equivalent of or and, as in English, introduces the second part of an alternative 
question (e.g. Would you like tea or coffee?). However, here and in many places across the text am exists without a contextual 
setup or corollary (e.g. Or coffee?). Clearly, this does not fully make sense. The translators wriggle and try to explain, but not 
convincingly. Sometimes by sticking with or - or by replacing or ignoring it - they stumble upon sense because the 
surrounding text happens to fall kindly for them. But where they are true to their dominant premises they are left often with 
an awkward non sequitur. My process was this: I identified ah cases of am in the text, placing them in one of two categories: 
those which perform the standard offices of or (e.g. Would you like tea or coffee?), and those which do not, those which have 
no natural preceding part (e.g. Or coffee?). This latter category I called the ‘hanging am'. Upon reviewing ah cases of the 
hanging am it became clear that the fact that am exists also in this second state indicates not a deficiency but rather the 
presence of a separate textual entity. The Traditionalist has failed entirely to understand the point and purpose of the 
hanging am which is why, in part, his translation reads in such a stalling, faltering way where it occurs. Its function, however, 
is twofold: rhetorical and logistical. It is rhetorical in that it identifies a key claim or scenario prior to answering or clarifying 
that claim or scenario, operating like a Q&A sheet. The logistical function provided by the hanging am consists in the fact 
that it operates as a marker so that ah such Q&As may readily be identified and drawn together, thus providing an 
illuminating study as well as a reference guide for fielding common questions. The entire set is found at 2:108, 2:133, 2:140, 
2:214, 4:53, 4:54, 6:143, 6:144, 6:144, 9:16,10:31,10:38,11:13, 11:35,13:16,13:33,13:33,18:9, 21:21, 21:24, 21:43, 23:68:,

4648. 21:24 [4], The word remembrance indicates in many cases what we would call today history. The Qur'an covers both what 

was (at the time of the revelation) current events as well as what was for the people of that time history proper. Now, of 
course, the two are merged for us into one, both being histories. This is a point which the Traditionalist seems unable to 
process. The battles, dramas and religious requirements of those in previous times (including those of the messenger and 
those with him) pertained to those people - although with moral lessons for us today. What we need today for the business 
of knowing God's will and doing it is found within the Qur'an and requires no supplementation (and to proceed on any other 
basis requires one to be honest and reject the Qur'an's divine authority, since to regard it as deficient is to reject its own 
claims).

it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172).

shown in this work to mean to give [what is conducive to) - or to pay [the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social

87. And he of the fish: 4725 


4723. 21:85 [3], Arabic: dhul kifl. There are two general views on the meaning of dhfil kifl each of which is presented below. 
Muhammad Asad's comment on this point (which general position I have taken) follows with some light editing: Lit., "and 
him of the pledge". The expression dhu 'l-kifl is derived from the verb kafaia and especially the form takaffala - which signifies 
"he became responsible [for something or someone]" or "pledged himself [to do something]". Although the classical 
commentators consider dhu 'l-kifl to be the epithet or the proper name of a particular prophet - whom they variously, more or 
less at random, identify with Elijah or Joshua or Zachariah or Ezekiel - I fail to see any reason whatever for such attempts at 
"identification"]...]. I am, therefore, of the opinion that we have here (as in the identical expression in 38:48] a generic term 
applying to every one of the prophets, inasmuch as each of them pledged himself unreservedly to God and accepted the 
responsibility for delivering His message to man. Abdullah Yusuf Ali takes the other (and more popular view). While I have not 
been guided by him, I include his comment here for the sake of completion: Dhu al Kifl would literally mean "possessor of, or 
giving, a double requital or portion”: or else, “one who used a cloak of double thickness,” that being one of the meanings of Kifl. 
The Commentators differ in opinion as to who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and the point of his being grouped with 
Isma'il and Idris for constancy and patience. I think the best suggestion is that afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his 
Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien, Copenhagen, 1778, 2:264-266, as quoted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam under "Dhu al Kifl". He 
visited Meshed 'Ah in Iraq, and also the little town called Kefil, midway between Najafand Hillah (Babylon). Kefil, he says, is the 
Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of Ezekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on a pilgrimage. If we accept "Dhu al Kifl” to be 
not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of “Ezekiel”, it fits the context. Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to 
Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old 
Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb, (Ezekiel, 3:25-26). He bore it all with 
patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in 
words which are eternally true: "Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the 
flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye 
not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken ..." etc. (Ezekiel, 
34:2-4). Dhu al Kifl is again mentioned in 38:48 along with Isma'il and Elisha. 

4724. 21:85 [4], Arabic: alsabirun. See 2:155. 

4725. 21:87 [1], Abdullah Yusuf Ali's comments here - while they assume uncritically the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis - are, 
nevertheless, useful: Dhu al Nun, "the man of the Fish or the Whale", is the title of Jonah (Yunus), because he was swallowed by 
a large Fish or Whale. He was the prophet raised to warn the Assyrian capital Nineveh]..] His story is told in 37:139-149. When 
his first warning was unheeded by the people, he denounced God's wrath on them. But they repented and God forgave them for 
the time being. Jonah, meanwhile, departed in wrath, discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission. He should have 
remained in the most discouraging circumstances, and relied on the power of God; for God had power both over Nineveh and 
over the Messenger He had sent to Nineveh. He went away to the sea and took a ship, but apparently the sailors threw him out 
as a man of bad omen in a storm. He was swallowed by a big Fish (or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried to God 
and confessed his weakness. The "darkness" may be interpreted both physically and spiritually: physically, as the darkness of the 
night and the storm and the Fish’s body: spiritually as the darkness in his soul, his extreme distress in the situation which he had 
brought on himself. God Most Gracious forgave him. He was cast out ashore: he was given the shelter of a plant in his state of 
physical and mental lassitude. He was refreshed and strengthened, and the work of his mission prospered. Thus he overcame all

his righteous judgment (if he be not patient with them, what hope would we ourselves have had?), and take God as our 
defence. These words echo those ofYa'qub at 12:18.

follows 'a means’ (that is: he chooses a path). It is on the basis of the thinking there that I render likewise here. Some 
translators choose to interpret samd’ as roof and see an attempt at suicide by hanging: others an imperative to stretch out a 
rope into the sky. Neither has merit in my view. The emphasis, surely, is different. It is that even conquering the vault of 
heaven (by whatever means) makes no difference to the fundamental truths of creation, life and death and God's supremacy 
and power over all things. 

4792. 22:15 [3], Arabic: qata’a. This verb has several meanings which - as many translators indicate - include to cut, sever. 
However, it also means traverse, cross, ford and in the given context I incline towards this sense.

represented today by the Gabrs of Iran and, more prominently, by the Parsis of India and Pakistan. Their religion, though

4817. 22:26 [4], Arabic: r-k-‘- lowly (i.e. before God). See Article V. 

4818. 22:26 [4], Arabic: s-j-d. See Article VI. 

4819. 22:27 [1], Arabic: hajj - pilgrimage, debate. See 2:158. The verses which treat of hajj are of historical interest only. There is no 
difference between such a history and one dealing, for example, with Adam or Nuh. Verses 22:26-29 treat only of Ibrahim. 
The second portion (22:30-34) outlines principles for the believers and closes at 22:34 with: ‘And for every community we 
appointed a rite: That they remember the name of God over what he has given them of livestock cattle for food[..f. We also read 
at 22:67 for every community we appointed a rite for them to perform'. The Traditionalist, naturally, takes this to mean that it 
is his job is to fill in the details on what the rites of Ibrahim were from sources which ascribe to the messenger knowledge 
the Qur'an denies him. For me, what is not found in the Qur'an is not found in it for a reason (31:27); had we been expected 
to mirror particular rites they would have been given to us in the kind of detail the Qur'an provides regarding, for example, 
inheritance law, divorce, or a woman's monthly courses. The verses at 22:26-29 provide history only; an instance when rites 
were performed; verses 22:30-34 give us the principles as they concern us. This is all the information we need. 

4820. 22:27 [4], The vocabulary provides strong support for Petra as the locus of al masjid al haram (the city is approached by 
more than one dramatic ravine - including a cleft in the rock, no less, called al siq). No ravine is found in any approach to the 
city today called Makkah (see 9:28 and Article XVIII). I am not aware of a comparable claim under either the Arabia Felix 
thesis or ‘Aslr-Hejaz thesis. 

4821. 22:28 [2], The Arabic here is: ma’lumat - given, known; fixed, determined, appointed. Nowhere does it say that these days are 
fixed by God. For the only other instance of ma'lumat see 2:197.

4823. 22:29 [3], Arabic: tawafa. See 2:125. 

4824. 22:29 [3], Arabic: al bayt al ‘atiq - the ancient house. This expression occurs at 22:29 and 22:33. The Traditionalist ascribes 
to this term a specific and specialised meaning in support of his religion (namely, he chooses to claim it as a further 
appellation for the box-like structure to which he bows down in the city today known as Makkah). Some points of interest: 
firstly, the verb rendered circumambulate by the Traditionalist is demonstrably used in the Qur'an to mean to move about or 
to move among (see 2:215); secondly, Petra and the surrounding region are objectively and universally acknowledged (by 
non-sectarians) as very ancient burial sites; thirdly, at Petra there are feasting halls attached to graves where tribes would 
meet and feast. I contend firstly, that whatever is meant by the ancient house, it does not - and could not - have anything to 
do with Makkah (see Article XVIII); secondly, that the case for associating the ancient house with facets of life in Petra is 
strong given that it was truly an ancient site at the time in question; and thirdly, that this episode is given purely as an 
example of rites - rites of a people now passed into history, and that were the details required by us they would have been 
preserved in the Qur'an. Clearly, the people who received this revelation knew what rites were meant. But the site at al 
masjid al haram is now closed (see 9:28) and of no interest beyond its place as part of those historical dramas the Qur'an 
includes. There is one rite which is important for our purposes, and that is given clearly at 22:34: ‘And for every community 
we appointed a rite: That they remember the name of God over what he has given them of livestock cattle for foodf.f - namely, 
that we are to mention the name of God when we kill or eat cattle since we are not to take the life of a sentient animal lightly. 

4825. 22:30 [1], Sc. was then. The Traditionalist (and other) translators are lost by the use of the ill-fitting dhalikas in this chapter. 
They interpolate and guess on an ad hoc basis, but neither convincingly nor with conviction. It is only when one understands 
these seemingly awkward, ill-fitting instances of dhalika as an intentional device - which is an obvious line of thought given 
what has been uncovered regarding, for instance, kadhalika (see 26:59), kalla (see 74:16) and am (see 21:21) - that a cogent 
picture appears. The instances at 22:30, 22:32 and 22:60 clearly form associated, graduated elliptical statements which find 
their resolution in the double statement at 22:70. See also the note to 22:3.

4826. 22:30 [5]. Muhammad Asad renders the Arabic awthan somewhat freely as the loathsome evil of idolatrous beliefs and

false values: hence the subsequent injunction to shun "every word that is untrue".

4837. 22:34 [2], The Traditionalist's stock-in-trade is rite and dogma. As he himself admits, the Qur’an is conspicuously lacking in 
both. Here, however, we are given a single rite with enough detail to allow us to implement it and in a context which speaks 
of every community. On this basis we may reasonably assume that we are to keep this also. This point is confirmed at 22:67.

4844. 22:40 [1], Arabic: bighayri [al] haqq. See Article XIX. 

4845. 22:40 [3], I rendered this cloisters in the first editions. After further research, I now render it pious communities as a broader, 
non-sectarian term for monasteries (as per Muhammad Asad, N. J. Dawood and Saheeh International, for example). My 
reasons are connected with my understanding of the verse as a whole, for which see further notes to this verse. 

4846. 22:40 [3], Arabic: haddama. This form II verb is the only instance of the h-d-m root, a fact which suggests that particular care 
should be taken with it. However, having looked at all available lexicons, there seems to have been no attempt to co-opt it. 
The verb means to destroy, to raze, to puli down or to demolish. There are no grounds as far as I know to believe it treats of 
anything other than physical structures. 

4847. 22:40 [4], Arabic: hiya‘. This word is said by the Traditionalist to mean churches. This is the only instance of this word, which 
fact renders it vulnerable for the usual reasons. Clearly, biya c has come to mean churches (as in church buildings ) over time, 
but there are excellent grounds for doubting this as the original meaning. The verb root from which biya’ is derived is b-y-\ 
This root has two related senses: allegiance and trade-, they are related since allegiance is pledged in the same way as trade is 
conducted: by means of contract. The many meanings found in any comprehensive Arabic lexicon formed on this root relate 
to just such a source (i.e. contract and trade), with the exception of biya c . All other instances of this root in the Qur'an 
conform absolutely to the principle just stated (9:111, 48:10, 48:10, 48:18, 60:12, 60:12, 60:12; 2:282; 2:254, 2:275, 2:275, 
9:111, 14:31, 24:37, 62:9). The word bay‘ (visually identical to biya c in its non-diacritic form) means sale or trade for 
example (cf. especially 24:36-38). See further notes to this verse. 

4848. 22:40 [5], Arabic: salawat. I.e. such duties as are incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. In 
its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the 
statement at 1:5 forms our part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to 
acknowledge God's authority (see 7:172). Here, however, the Traditionalist again abandons his default value for salat as a 
five-time daily ritual (of a particularly ‘Muslim' kind), this time - bizarrely - in favour of Jewish synagogues. I remain constant 
to my stated value for salat throughout. See extended note to this verse below. 

4849. 22:40 [6], Arabic: masjid, masajid. See Article IX.i. 

4850. 22:40 [6], Sc. would be lost. One should understand the Traditionalist's problems at this verse, because once we understand 
those, it becomes clear why he has rendered the verse so bizarrely (with salawat meaning Jewish synagogues and the 
established root for trade and contract reinvented as churches). What he wishes to achieve is an equivalence for his religion

41. Those who 4851 if we establish them in the land 


(i.e. that mechanism for social control created some 200 years after the revelation of the Qur'an initiated by Persian 
operatives which goes today by the name of Islam) with the religions called Christianity and Judaism. We already know that 
masajid cannot possibly mean what the Traditionalist claims for it (i.e. specifically - and exclusively - ‘Islamic' places of 
worship) but, rather, means places of worship in a general, non-sectarian sense (cf. 7:29, 17:7); but absent the type of 
methodical analysis presented here, the Traditionalist has been able to fudge that point in the eyes of the laity. Having done 
that, the way is clear to attempt to get from monasteries (or pious communities ) to his fudged value for masajid as mosques in 
a way which implies equal status for the religion he has invented elsewhere. He attempts to do that by ascribing the values of 
the buildings characteristic for the main monotheistic religions to the stages in between - despite the fact that the result is 
both laughable and contrary to all norms of Arabic. But the Traditionalist has a second - and equally pressing - reason to 
divest this verse of its plain sense; if we allow the normative values for each of the constituent parts, it reads as an 
endorsement of centralised religious communities, something the Traditionalist has an ideological predisposition against 
with origins in his non-Qur'anic literature - despite the fact that the Qur'an clearly presupposes the creation and 
maintenance of communities with a strong emphasis on faith, learning, piety and outreach (see 3:104, for example). The 
religion which is today called Islam is interested in a very different model: that of the Caliphate - a concept nowhere found in 
the Qur'an (the word khilafa is not found, nor is the idea implied anywhere within its pages). However, while the object of 
creating and maintaining a community dedicated to God alone is absolutely central to the message of the Qur'an, men have 
shown themselves typically more interested in this-worldly conquest than in what the Qur'an has to say; that is, it is just 
such a 'pious community as that mentioned here at 22:40 which is the unit of Qur'anic advancement, and it is to the end of 
creating and maintaining such units that imperatives to the believers as a group tend to be directed. It is precisely that 
original purpose and remit which practical and politically-minded men had to thwart and bend towards the object of 
territorial conquest and conformist, non-thinking ‘religion'. These, then, are the underlying currents which have worn biya‘ 
into churches (a value which has become fixed over time) and salawat into the surreal value (in this one instance only) of 
Jewish synagogues. The Traditionalist can then point at masajid and claim his religious buildings to be on a par with those of 
Christianity and Judaism while defusing any implied imperative towards the formation of overtly pious communities. A brief 
summary of the facts will be instructive: the first value in the list is sawami' or monasteries (i.e. pious communities'). Such 
communities have been associated with religions of all stripes since time immemorial. There is nothing sectarian about the 
concept. Anyone who has studied the lives of monasteries or centralised religious communities will know that they typically 
form the economic and intellectual centres of the broader communities among which they are founded or - more 
commonly - which grow up around them. It is precisely the economic life focused on the ‘pious communities’ which biya‘ 
naturally references (i.e. the process of buying and selling) since such pious communities both generated and required 
material goods; salawat merely means here what it means throughout (i.e. duties) - duty being that very phenomenon which 
has characterised life in religious communities across millennia no matter what the denomination or confession (each 
member typically has a strict set of duties to perform consonant with the order of which he is a member); lastly, the ‘places 
of worship wherein the name of God is remembered much’ are merely a core and necessary feature of any such religious 
community; (I recommend reviewing 24:36-38 in the light of the above). The reason why I believe there to be an elliptical 
statement at the end of this clause is that the conclusion is inherently tentative (i.e. trade and duties and places of worship 
wherein the name of God is remembered much may survive the destruction of a central pious community building - albeit in 
another form - but it is, perhaps, unlikely); it is not a rule set in stone that the end of trade and duties and places of worship 
will be the consequence, but it is a real possibility and something which merits warning. Had God stated this conclusion 
explicitly, however, such consequences would have become binding. Since we are left to infer the consequences, the status of 
the warning is different. 

4851. 22:41 [1], This points back to the pious communities (or monasteries) of 22:40.

activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual

4889. 22:67 [1], Arabic: mansak - rite (sg.j. Certain Traditionalist translators wrest this singular noun into the plural to create the 
impression in the mind of the reader which they wish to promote (namely, that rites are central to what it is to believe in the 
Qur'an, and that since no such information is found in the Qur'an, their external ‘expertise’ is required). However, the word is 
in the singular and simply restates the only instance of any universal rite found in the Qur'an (see 22:34). The argument here 
is, in fact, precisely the opposite of what the Traditionalist wishes for it: against the practice of imposing rites and claiming 
them to be from God, not in favour of it. 

4890. 22:70 [2], Arabic: dhalika. Cf. 22:30, 22:32 and 22:60 which form elliptical statements and themselves anticipate this 
emphatic and explicit double statement which leads to the conclusion for those who dispute about the matter (at 22:71). See 
note at 22:30.

4910. 22:78 [2], Arabic: din. See Article VII. 

4911. 22:78 [4], Arabic: muslim - those who yield, those submitted (to God). See Article XV.iii. 

4912. 22:78 [5]. I.e. in this revelation. I base this understanding on the fact that in this (fi hddha) reliably references revelation 
(either the Qur’an or one previous) in all other instances (17:41,17:89,18:54, 21:106, 30:58, 39:27). 

4913. 22:78 [6], I.e. that we might read, appreciate and follow what the messenger gave us, namely, the Qur'an. 

4914. 22:78 [7], Cf. 2:143 and, for example, 22:72. The point has been assiduously missed over the centuries, but herein lies the 
duty of the muslim. The religion created by the Traditionalist is, at best, a distraction from the commission God gave men. 
This also refers back, surely, to 22:40-41. 

4915. 22:78 [8], Arabic: aqama al salat. I.e. to uphold such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article III. In its primary sense 
it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). Here, surely, this references the duty just described: to bear witness to men. 

4916. 22:78 [9], Arabic: atd al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation atd al zakdt is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

4927. 23:20 [1], Namely, a tree-covered or fertile mountain. See note to 2:63. 

4928. 23:20 [1], Arabic: sayna’. Usually rendered Sinai (however, see 95:2). Points arising include the fact that the Qur'an does not 

say that Musa talked with God at sayna’ and there is no direct Qur'anic identification of sayna’ with that location where those 
events took place; these are assumptions. The mountain claimed for Musa's encounter with God under the Egypt-Palestine 
thesis and found in the land today called Sinai was identified by Queen Helena, sister of the Emperor Constantine, based - at 
best - on incomplete information; there is little or no evidence to support that location, and much to refute it. The Petra 

thesis - or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis - might incline towards the location at Jabal al Lawz, known locally as Jabal 

Musa, in the northern part of modern Saudi Arabia, around 120 miles from Petra; however, that location is not a tur [mount] 
in the strict sense since Jabal al Lawz is barren and, again, the Qur'an does not say that sayna’ is that location where Musa 
spoke with God; rather, one is accustomed to assume it under the influence of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis. The 
Arabia Felix thesis advances a location for sayna’ which provides a more impressive correlation between the Qur'anic 
statements and geological and agricultural realia. As ever, more objective study is needed on the ground. See Article XVIII.

4958. 23:53 [1], Arabic: zubur. Identified by some as Psalms, this assertion fails since it is untenable in some instances across the 
complete set: 3:184, 16:44, 23:53, 26:196, 35:25, 54:43, 54:52. A comparison of all instances in combination with

historical or etymological data on this point, please let me know.

And that they show not their adornment save 
that apparent of it 5090 


5085. 24:30 [1], Arabic: (al) mu'minun. See note to 8:2. 

5086. 24:30 [1], It is obvious that men need to use their eyes to operate in the world. It is not possible not to not see women as we 
go about our business. However, men should retain prudent fear of God. And it is a great blessing in that regard if the women 
in a community treat themselves and their bodies with respect and understand that modesty frees rather than oppresses 
them. 

5087. 24:30 [2], Arabic: (sg ffarj, (p\.)furuj. Lit.: openings, gaps, apertures; vulvas. More generally it means chastity or modesty. 

5088. 24:31 [1], Arabic: (al) mu’minat. See note to 8:2. 

5089. 24:31 [2], Arabic: (sg.) farj, (pi.) furuj. Lit.: openings, gaps, apertures; vulvas. More generally it means chastity or modesty. In 
my understanding: any part of the female form possessed of what is called cleavage. 

5090. 24:31 [3], This provides the Qur'anic dress code for women (see also the imperative to lengthen the dress found at 33:59). 
Since this is a central issue for many people, I will summarise my thoughts in the following way. Is it true that the Qur'an 
requires a head-covering for ail believing women? No, it is not. Does the Qur’an require believing women to dress modestly?Yes, 
it does. Do societies exist where a head-covering is a requirement of modesty? Yes, there do. Does traditional 'Islamic' dress (i.e. 
long dress and headscarf) encompass the Qur'anic requirement for believing women? Yes, it does. Is the traditional 'Islamic' 
dress the same thing as the Qur'anic requirement? No, it is not. Now, while I know the claim that traditional ‘Islamic' dress is a 
Qur'anic imperative to be false, I must add the following point: women are told to dress so that they will be recognised as 
believers and not harassed (33:59). A headscarf and the other modesty requirements found in traditional 'Islamic' dress 
together meet this criterion for historical reasons (i.e. such women are, by dint of custom, known to be women of faith). 
However, traditional Jewish and Christian (Orthodox) women’s dress meets these requirements also. Distinct from these 
observations, it is my opinion that women who choose to dress modestly are providing a great service to themselves, their 
families and their societies; I also hold it to be a crime before God to ascribe to the Qur'an imperatives which the Qur'an does 
not contain. The problem in today's media-driven society, of course, is that the association with faith which the headscarf 
once had has given way to other associations: those of intellectual and cultural backwardness and unthinking adherence to 
violent ideologies. Here, as in all things, we are called upon to use our intelligence and discretion within the bounds of fixed 
principles.

5104. 24:35 [3], Abdullah Yusuf Ali makes a delightful comment here which I reproduce in full: The first three points in the Parable 
centre round the symbols of the Niche, the Lamp, and the Glass. (1) The Niche (Mishkah) is the little shallow recess in the wall of 
an Eastern house, fairly high from the ground, in which a light (before the days of electricity) was usually placed. Its height 
enabled it to diffuse the light in the room and minimised the shadows. The background of the wall and the sides of the niche 
helped throw the light well into the room, and if the wall was white-washed, it also acted as a reflector: the opening in front 
made the way for the light. So with the spiritual Light: it is placed high above worldly things: it has a niche or habitation of its 
own, in Revelation and other Signs of God; its access to men is by a special Way, open to all, yet closed to those who refuse its 
rays. (2) The Lamp is the core of the spiritual Truth, which is the real illumination; the Niche is nothing without it; the Niche is 
actually made for it. (3) The Glass is the transparent medium through which the Light passes. On the one hand, it protects the 
light from moths and other forms of low life (lower motives in man) and from gusts of wind (passions), and on the other, it 
transmits the light through a medium which is made up of and akin to the grosser substances of the earth (such as sand, soda, 
potash, etc.), so arranged as to admit the subtle to the gross by its transparency. So the spiritual Truth has to be filtered through 
human language or human intelligence to make it intelligible to mankind.

mentioned in connection with the participle of this verb - here and at 67:19 - Traditionalist translators generally render 
according to that accepted sense) b) there is no mention of wings - the Qur'an uses the word in other contexts but omits to 
do so here, and that suggests to me that this is not what is meant, and c) rendering saffat according to the accepted sense 
more than fits the context: birds certainly fly in ‘ranks’ (that is: formations). 

5119. 24:41 [3], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. 
Included specifically here are birds, which do not fly about to no purpose; they perform duties which devolve upon their

willed natural law which invariably makes the rise and fail of nations dependent on their moral qualities. I would add that 
while I agree with Asad's assessment, by the measure of the manifest failure of the ‘Islamic’ societies, one is left in no doubt 
that they do not meet the Qur'anic standard, and blaming one's failures on outside intervention and interests does not 
change that reality.

it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

5144. 24:56 [2], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation atd al zakat is 

shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 

activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

5204. 25:30 [2], Violent and emotional protestations by excitable persons notwithstanding, this verse is fully realised in the 
actions of those who claim to be the people of Muhammad. As a generalisation, they sing the Qur'an - sometimes very 
nicely - but they treat the book itself as a relic; in terms of practicalities it is abandoned in favour of traditions, inventions, 
man-made isms, etc. The Qur'an is not, as supposed, the foundation of the religion called Islam; were it fully removed, apart 
from the loss of the daily liturgy in which the Traditionalist reminds God of some small part of what he gave men to live by, 
there would be no discernible difference to the religion as commonly understood.

5217. 25:38 [3], Arabic: al rass - commencement, beginning. On the basis of my note at 15:78 I take rass as a common noun the 
meaning of which is commencement, beginning (see Lane, p. 1085). This much granted, it is reasonable to infer that the term 
denotes those who, after the flood, began life anew on the face of a purged earth. This is, clearly, speculation - albeit 
speculation consistent with the broader narrative and usage found in the Qur'an. While I am neutral on Muhammad Asad's 
thoughts here, I repeat part of his note on this point for interest: As for Al-Rass, a town of that name exists to this day in the 
Central-Arabian province of Al-Qasim; in the ancient times referred to it seems to have been inhabited by descendants of the 
Nabataean tribe ofThamud (Tabari). There is, however no agreement among the commentators as to the real meaning of this 
name or designation; Razi cites several of the current, conflicting interpretations and rejects all of them as purely conjectural.

5221. 25:40 [1], A clear indication of the city of Lut. This may be claimed as support for the location of al masjid al haram at Petra 
and, perhaps, for the broader proposal that Muhammad was originally an inhabitant of that city if we agree with the Dead 
Sea as the locus for the cities of Lut; the Arabia Felix thesis advances an alternative location. Makkah is many hundreds of 
kilometres away from either location. See Article XVIII.

5281. 26:16 [1], Grammar: dual. 

5282. 26:16 [1], Arabic: fir'awn. See note to 2:49. 

5283. 26:16 [1], Arabic: rasiil - messenger. The message was one and the emphasis is not on the messenger but on the message. 
Messenger-worship (as with the majority of Christians) and messenger cults (as with the majority of Muslims) are simply 
stages - practiced over ages and in many different cultures - in the process of the dilution and pollution of the message sent 
by God. 

5284. 26:17 [1], Many translators - under the influence of the King James Bible - render here and in other such places: let the 
children of Israel go. This paints a picture in the mind of the reader of a people straining to leave. This is not the picture 
which emerges in the Arabic of the Qur'an. 

5285. 26:19 [2], Arabic: al kafirun. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. The value we are using throughout 
for al kafirun fits here without modification Fir'awn's usage of it. Fir'awn is accusing Musa of hypocrisy; of a contradiction 
between his words and his actions; of claiming to be affiliated with righteousness while acting contrary to it tenets - and our 
value fits perfectly. The Traditionalist's assumed value of infidel or unbeliever would be ludicrous here, and he typically 
switches to ungrateful or synonyms at this point in order to accommodate that reality. 

5286. 26:20 [1], Arabic: al dalun. See note to 3:90. Mainstream factions within the cult known as Islam have a doctrine which 
claims that all prophets and messengers were sinless. Such a doctrine is refuted in multiple places in the Qur'an. God uses 
men who repent of their past misdeeds, make right if they are able, and then serve him.

5288. 26:24 [1], Grammar: dual. 

5289. 26:24 [2], Grammar: the shift to the plural indicates an appeal to the wider audience - an appeal which Fir'awn counters. 

5290. 26:24 [2], Arabic: yaqina. See note to 2:4.The argument here is staccato. This is not a leisurely debate. Musa is following his 
tack, delivering his message, and Fir'awn is interrupting him. The present thought is completed at 44:7-8. Instances where 
speech either trails off or is clipped through interruption are found at 2:138, 3:73, 6:143, 6:144, 10:22, 12:94, 22:17, 26:24, 
26:26, 26:28, 43:9, 58:22, 77:11. 

5291. 26:25 [1], Fir'awn's tactics are instructive: at 26:25 he mocks the message; at 26:27 he mocks the messenger; at 26:29 he 
threatens the messenger with physical violence; then when his bluff is called he puts the ruling elite in fear of losing its 
position of dominance (26:34-35).

5330. 26:84 [1], In my opinion, this prayer has been answered in the Qur'an. The account of Abraham in Genesis is defamatory in 
the extreme, grants no backstory or context for God's choice of Abraham (other than God's fortuitous, prescient appreciation 
of the ‘Jewishness' of many of his progeny], and has clearly been redacted to serve questionable purposes: the installation of 
Ishaq as the sole heir, a programme of racial supremacism, and a policy of deceit and duplicity as norm and religious 
obligation. When read dispassionately, the actions of the character called Abraham in Genesis are suspect in many cases and 
unbefitting a person of even average moral fibre, never mind a prophet of God. This calumny is fully dispatched by the 
Qur’an which presents Ibrahim in a fitting light.

5357. 26:130 [1], I.e. as ones who take no consideration of moral restraint. Muhammad Asad comments here: The term jabbar, 
when applied to man, as a rule denotes one who is haughty, overbearing, exorbitant and cruel, and does not submit to any moral 
restraints in his dealings with those who are weaker than himself. Sometimes (as, e.g., in 11:59 or 14:15) this term is used to 
describe a person’s negative ethical attitude, and in that case it may be rendered as "enemy of the truth". In the present 
instance, however, stress is laid on the tyrannical behaviour of the tribe of’Ad, evidently relating to their warlike conflicts with 
other people: and in this sense it expresses a Qur’anic prohibition, valid for all times, of all unnecessary cruelty in warfare, 
coupled with the positive, clearly-implied injunction to subordinate every act of war - as well as the decision to wage war as 
such - to moral considerations and restraints.

5380. 26:163 [1], See note to 2:2. 

5381. 26:163 [2], Cf. 3:50, 26:108, 26:110, 26:126, 26:131, 26:144, 26:150, 26:163, 26:179, 43:63.

5383. 26:166 [2], Arabic: bal. See note to 2:88. 

5384. 26:166 [2], The Qur'an does not treat male homosexuals as victims (of genetics or of any other kind); it presents them as 
transgressors (2:166) and as people expressing an irrational choice (11:78), one borne of ignorance (27:55). It reproves 
them as transgressors, much in the same way as it reproves transgressors of a number of types (political, economic and so 
forth). There is no question but that male homosexuality is wrong within the purview of the Qur'an. However, one should 
remember that male homosexuals are under no compulsion to be believers themselves (cf. 2:256). Logically, should a 
particular man be a believer but find himself afflicted with drives he chooses to regard as too powerful to control, should he 
wish to renounce his faith in favour of homosexual sin, that is nobody's business but his own so long as he does not impact 
the believing society with his sin. The Qur'an safeguards people's privacy in their homes against prying persons (24:27, 
24:61), a right a practicing homosexual man should enjoy as much as anyone else. Within the Qur'anic jurisprudence binding 
upon believers, then, male homosexuality is sexual immorality, there is no question but that it is both fundamentally wrong 
and taboo. It logically falls under the same legislation and punitive requirements as sexual intercourse outside marriage of 
any other type (marriage being recognised only between one male and up to four females). However, the Qur'anic mood is 
not one of instant and total condemnation; comparable contexts suggests that wrong action should be discouraged and 
reproved by friends and 'let be' if people repent and reform (cf. 4:16-17), and there can be punishment only when specific 
circumstances are met (cf. 24:2). Additionally, one should remember that Ibrahim entreated God on behalf of the city of Lut 
(11:74), and Lut himself reproved his people before he left and they were punished. The Qur'an does not pretend that sin is 
not sin; but neither does it strain to cast the first stone - or, in fact, any stones - despite what the Traditionalist contends, in 
this case or in any other. See 24:10, 24:14, 24:20 which treat of sexual contexts for reminders that we are all in need of God's

5385. 26:171 [1], One of the functions of the Qur'an is to correct calumnies levelled against the prophets in the corrupted texts of 

previous peoples. Chapter 19 of Genesis has it that Lot (Lut) committed incest with his daughters after leaving the city - to 
ensure (as one is given to understand) the continuance of the family line due to a dearth of males in the new location; the 
daughters' argument rings hollow given that the males of the city they fled could not have provided issue in any case (a point 
alluded to at 11:78-79). More convincing, perhaps, would be an argument for the need to raise up further children to Lot 
(Lut) on the grounds that his wife was now dead, but such an argument is closed down by the Qur'an which states explicitly 
his wife was an 'old woman.' Thus, the Talmudic-sounding ‘justification' found in Genesis 19 for incest is refuted on whatever 
basis it might be advanced: Lut's wife had been past childbearing age, thus it made no difference from the point of view of 
procreation that she was now dead, and the men of the city of Lut were not potential husbands for his daughters, thus the 
dearth of eligible men in the scenario following that of the destruction of the city of Lut was - in this regard at least - no 
different to that which preceded it. The primary function of the Book of Genesis in its current condition is to create and 
protect a programme of racial survival and supremacy, and is a composite of different accounts, probably constructed by 
Ezra after release from Babylon. See note to 26:84.

given by God which is as fixed as any set of physical laws. (The cause of the ruling elite's drive to promote the notion of 
relativism in the physical world via pseudo-science becomes clear once we understand that it is the philosophical 
component needed to install a worldview orientated towards moral relativism by which the masses are detached from any 
sense of objective moral certainty and trained to accept the arbitrary rule of men.]

5408. 26:210 [1], Said by most commentators to refer to the Qur'an. This is possible; however, in the context, it is perhaps possible 
that it relates to the punishment meted out against the rejecters of the messengers and that the hearing at 26:212 is the 
moment when God brings in his decree. This is a personal observation and God knows best.

5411. 26:219 [1], Arabic: s-j-d. See Article VI. Cf. 3:196, 16:46. The word taqalluba means going to and fro. If the Traditionalist is to 
insist on sajada as to prostrate rather than to submit he is - if he is to be consistent - left with a mental image of the 
messenger picking his way through the mass of believers in a position of prostration. That is not what Traditionalist claims 
for this verse; but it should be if he wishes to present his case consistently. 

5412. 26:222 [1], Arabic: ‘-th-m. See Article Xlll.i. 

5413. 26:224 [1], The modern equivalent of poets are creators of novels and films. Culture within organised societies has always

is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our 
part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see 
7:172). 

5425. 27:3 [2], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

also argue that this verse implies a relation to the muqatta’at letters (see note to 2:1) about which men were not certain for

the Qur’an was sent down to him at that place. Petra had been a sanctuary from ancient times, a fact which is liberally 
confirmed in the historical record. Makkah, on the other hand, does not appear on any map until 300 years after the Qur'anic 
revelation. Petra is now closed (see 9:28 and Article XVIII).

5557. 28:14 [1], Arabic: istawa - where this occurs with ‘ala I render it to take one’s place (which almost exclusively treats of God 
in relation to his throne). Here there is no object, yet I have rendered it likewise on the basis of two considerations: firstly, 
due to the preponderance of instances where this verb occurs and must be rendered thus; secondly, on the basis of the 
tantalising statement by Fir'awn's wife at 28:9 that they might take Musa for a son, given that conversation of such a nature 
between a ruler and his wife can be reasonably understood to imply a throne. All references where this form of the verb 
occurs in the masculine singular past are found at 2:29, 7:54, 10:3, 13:2, 20:5, 25:59, 28:14, 32:4, 41:11, 48:29, 53:6, 57:4. 
The verse at 41:11 is the only one in this set which does not permit such a reading, which is in keeping with the fact that it 
uses a different preposition (//a). 

5558. 28:15 [1], Musa had to sneak into the city. We have no facts, but we can reasonably surmise that the city was not open to him 
for some reason, perhaps connected with his royal standing. 

5559. 28:15 [2], Arabic: shi'ah - sect, persuasion. 

5560. 28:15 [2], Fir'awn is clearly identified as the enemy (28:8). The man whom Musa killed was of the sect of Fir'awn.

appetites to guide them; and - what is more often than not the case (perhaps, especially) today - they are simply too lazy or 
ill-prepared to apply themselves to understand what others stand upon on the basis of knowledge, to say nothing of doing 
the hard work needed to gain such knowledge for themselves. Nevertheless, they are keen to impress upon one the

5628. 28:57 [1], This is the argument of the pragmatic man, the man who knows how the world works and wants to work with it. 

5629. 28:57 [2], If one is to read this literally, then it is in keeping with the identification of al masjid al haram at Petra (see Article 
XVIII). However, I agree also with the import of the second part of Muhammad Asad's note on this verse: [,..]In its purely 
spiritual connotation, on the other hand, the "sanctuary secure" is God’s promise - referred to in verse 61 below - that all who 
have faith in Him and are conscious of their responsibility to Him shall be graced with a sense of inner peace in this world and 
with enduring bliss in the life to come; and since they are thus to be rewarded with the "fruits" of all their good deeds, "no fear 
need they have, and neither shall they grieve" (cf. 2:62, 3:170, 5:69, 6:48, 7:35, 10:62, 46:13], I would add that the majority of 
the power that the shaytan and the Satanic system hold over people in the world in which we currently live centres upon the 
threat of lack; we become free of that threat when we internalise the fact that all provision is of God. 

5630. 28:58 [2], In Arabic tilka - those. This indicates something nearby. Under the Petra thesis - or the Petra pilgrimage part 
thereof - as advanced by Dan Gibson, the majority of the locations in the histories related in the Qur'an are reasonably close 
to Petra. The Arabia Felix thesis places these locations together also, though in the south of the Arabian Peninsula. See 
Article XVIII. 

5631. 28:58 [2], Petra was destroyed soon after the time of the messenger by the people to whom he brought the message - the 
Arabs. See Article XVIII.

5632. 28:59 [1], Arabic: ummah. In this context it means the ' mother 1 of the surrounding area, hence: principle city. By extension, 
one may reasonably infer that Muhammad in his capacity as a messenger was sent to the principle city of his people. The city 
of Petra, as a major trading centre, was the principle city of Nabataean Arabia. The Arabia Felix thesis advances an 
alternative. Makkah cannot be shown to have existed at this time and appears on no map until 900 CE. See Article XVIII.

5641. 28:66 [1], Lit.: blind. 

5642. 28:68 [1], Muhammad Asad spots and expresses well a good point at this juncture; his comment is repeated in full: Some of 
the classical commentators incline to interpret the ma in the phrase ma kana lahum al-khirah as a particle of negation and the 
noun khirah as "choice" or "freedom of choice", thus giving to this phrase the meaning of "He chooses, [but] they [i.e., human 
beings] have no freedom of choice". To my mind, however, this interpretation conflicts not only with the immediately preceding 
passages but with the tenor of the Qur'an as a whole, which insists throughout on man’s responsibility for [and, hence, on 
relative freedom in) choosing between right and wrong - and this side by side with its stress on God’s unlimited power to 
determine the factual course of events. Hence, I prefer to base my rendering on the interpretation advanced and convincingly 
argued by Tabari, who regards the crucial particle ma not as a negation but as a relative pronoun synonymous with alladhi 
("that which" or "whatever"), and understands the noun khirah in its primary significance of "that which is chosen" or 
"preferred", i.e., because it is considered to be the best: in another word, as a synonym of khayr. Zamakhshari refers to this

5780. 30:2 [1], I follow the active voice here: ahalabat. The Byzantine Romans defeated the early Muslims at the battle of Mu'tah in 
629 CE (8 AH), in the Dead Sea region. This is a historical fact for which we have contemporaneous and reliable (i.e. non- 
hadith ) Byzantine sources. That battle ground is approximately 50 km from Petra. The battle of Tabuk (approximately 200 
km from Petra) is said to have taken place within a year or two, and that the Muslims were victorious against the Romans 
(albeit through achieving a successful expedition rather than actual engagement). Admittedly, there is no non-Islamic source 
and the Muslim sources are - like all non-Qur’anic Islamic sources - deserving, in my view, of suspicion. Nevertheless, this 
scenario and the reasoning for my rendering 30:2-5 form a cogent, logical whole. The Traditionalist has the Romans losing to 
and then defeating the Persians; his attempts to explain why this would be a cause for rejoicing among the believers are 
entirely unconvincing. I am indebted to Layth al-Shaiban for this insight.

5785. 30:6 [1], Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here: The promise refers to the Decision of ail things by the Command of God, Who will 
remove all troubles and difficulties from the path of His righteous Believers, and help them to rejoice over the success of their 
righteous Cause. This refers to all times and all situations. The righteous should not despair in their darkest moments, for God's 
help will come. Ordinarily men are puffed up if they score a seeming temporary success against the righteous, and do not realise 
that God’s Will can never be thwarted.

5823. 30:30 [3], The Traditionalist claims that the religion of'Islam' is what is referenced here. No organised religion that I know of 
pre-exists in my nature. However, my soul recognises and responds to the truths contained in that doctrine which is implicit 
and explicit in the Qur'an. But these truths do not presuppose any sort of religion (if by religion we mean choosing to believe 
something one knows to be wholly or partially untrue, patching over the shortfall by drowning out experiential data on the 
basis of learned dogma). As we say in English: the devil is in the details. And, as the Traditionalist is so fond of pointing out, 
the Qur'an does not provide ‘the details'. The Traditionalist argues that the Qur'an is deficient (a condition which can be 
corrected by means of his preferred literature): for my part, I argue that the Qur'an does not envisage a religion in the sense 
that the Traditionalist means it (or at least in the sense that I think he means it given what I see him do with what he claims 
to believe). There is nothing wrong with choosing a particular implementation of those basic principles one finds in the 
Qur'an and creating a jurisprudence around them; there is everything wrong with insisting that the methods one chooses to 
employ are themselves ordained by God when they have no explicit basis in the Qur'an; cf. 12:40. 

5824. 30:30 [5], Arabic; din. See Article VII. This exact phrase occurs at 9:36,12:40, 30:30.

5841. 30:40 [5]. Arabic: sh-r-k. See 6:78 and Article VIII. The concept of partners is said by the Traditionalist to refer only to 
fraudulent gods. I think the connotation is much wider than that and includes authorities of any kind (today: government, 
heavily promoted ‘scientists', opinion-makers such as actors and other semi-fictitious personas) and all fiction-based belief 
systems, including most of what today passes for religion.

5875. 30:60 [3], Arabic: istakhaffa. This form X verb means - as sometimes rendered - to deem lightly or to hold in light esteem. 
However, it does so only where it takes an object using the preposition bi. Where it takes a direct object (as here) it means 
either to fluster, flurry, disquiet or to find light (the case here clearly that of swaying or sweeping or carrying along a person 
away from or towards a position) or to deem light (i.e. to carry) - the former set of connotations being correct in this case. 
The two senses are connected by the core concept which is to find easy to move (from place, position or opinion). It occurs in 
the first sense here at 30:60 and at 43:54, and in the second sense at 16:80.

5967. 33:1 [1], The prophet is addressed directly (i.e. in the vocative) 13 times in the Qur'an - 5 of them in this chapter. The 
chapter treats, among other things, of the right relationship towards the prophet and his wives, and the right relationships 
between believers themselves, and between believers and the wider world.

5973. 33:4 [2]. The Traditionalist insists upon a fanciful, highly specialised interpretation here, one which assists him in his 
broader aim of creating an opening by which he can insinuate himself and his usurping literature into the mind of the reader. 
In summary, his assertion (see also 58:1-4) is that pre-Islamic Arabs would divorce their wives by saying that a wife was ‘like 
the back of' his mother and that it is this practice which the verb at this juncture (rendered by me as assist) references. No 
support is found for this assertion in the text itself; we are expected simply to take the Traditionalist's word for it. If the 
Traditionalist could point to a history of intellectual rigour, honest research and plain dealing, I might be so tempted; since 
he cannot, I choose to verify the evidence for myself. Facts first: the form III verb based on zahara objectively and correctly 
means to assist, to help, to aid, to support - and the Traditionalist himself renders this form III verb in just this sense in all 
other instances outside of this specific context and its adjunct at 58:1-4 (see 9:4, 33:26, 60:9). Allowing the verb its natural 
meaning (i.e. that of assisting among your wives) fits the context exactly. The Qur'anic redress for those who swear off their 
wives (which is what the Traditionalist is claiming as the sense here though by another name) is entirely different and 
comprehensively treated at 2:226. Now to the application of reason: in a context which permits of limited polygamy a 
situation is possible in which one wife might not be able to have children while others might be able to have them. In such a 
case, a man - it may be reasoned - might decide (it is assumed within the Qur'anic principle of mutual consultation) to 
'assist both the fertile and infertile wives by allowing the infertile wife to raise a child born to the fertile wife. Thus, the 
infertile wife might experience something of the joys of motherhood and the fertile wife - who may already have her hands 
full with existing children - might get support in the raising of a child. (Other comparable scenarios are where the husband 
has a child from a previous wife, or a wife brings an existing child into a marriage.) The point in such scenarios (i.e. in which 
a man 'assists’ among his wives) is that we should remember who the true mother is and not obfuscate that fact. These 
points granted, it is possible to envisage a case in which a man has allowed a wife to raise a child to whom she is not the 
natural mother and that that decision has resulted either in regret on the part of the natural mother or in a change of mind 
on the part of the man. It is surely such a case which is the subject here, i.e. one in which a man has to go back on this 
arrangement (returning a child to the care of its natural mother, thus depriving the adoptive mother of her charge). This 
scenario is addressed also at 58:1-4, to which the present verse forms an adjunct. 

5974. 33:4 [3], This presages 33:37 which treats of Zeyd, the prophet's own adopted son, and indirectly makes it clear that Zeyd 
was not to be considered heir to the prophet. 

5975. 33:4 [5], Arabic: al haqq. See Article XIX (al haqq i.).

Arabia. Dan Gibson, my source for what I call here the Petra thesis, accepts the Traditionalist's assertion on this point. I am 
inclined to accept it also as the town for which the prophet left his home and became its head. However, the Arabia Felix

6031. 33:33 [6], Arabic: bayt. I reject the idea that women are to be (or were) bound to one physical house. The context here is of 
households - families with which the wives of the prophet had a connection, as the following context makes clear. The point 
is that they were to be chaperoned by family members and never to allow themselves to be in a situation where accusations 
could be made against them by malicious tongues. This was to provide a safeguard to the honour and integrity of the wider 
community. The list of those with whom they could freely associate is given at 33:55. Etiquette and protocol exist for persons 
of high standing in all societies. (The restrictions are the same for those found guilty of sexual misdeeds; see 4:15 and the 
note thereto.) 

6032. 33:33 [7], Lit.: purify you with purification. 

6033. 33:34 [1], Arabic: ayat. See Article X. 

6034. 33:34 [1], The reader should be aware that the Traditionalist makes specious claims for wisdom (hikma ) as found here, 

ascribing to it on the basis of no Qur'anic evidence a value (here specifically, but at other times when it suits him) equal to 

those collections of a later and extraneous literature which he follows in derogation of the revelation of God. The absence of 

any basis in the Qur'an for his claim may be demonstrated by comparing and considering all instances of the word found 
therein: 2:129, 2:151, 2:231, 2:251, 2:269, 2:269, 3:48, 3:81, 3:164, 4:54, 4:113, 5:110, 16:125, 17:39, 31:12, 33:34, 38:20, 
43:63, 54:5, 62:2 all of which have a footnote which references this verse. The operative verb in any case is the passive mood 
of recite, and recite always relates to something read out or repeated from memory, so wisdom in this instance must - along 
with proofs of God - refer to something of that type. The Traditionalist has conflated the concept of a verse in the Qur'an with 
that of a proof [aya). To him all verses are proofs. However, the preponderance of evidence is that this is not correct. Some 
verses (or collections thereof) are proofs, others are wisdom-, yet others comprise law. While I do not claim that such 
distinctions are mutually exclusive, I think it is safe to say that not every verse is in itself a proof if for no other reason than 
the fact that the verse divisions do not comprise part of the revelation; they were decided upon by men.

6048. 33:36 [4], I.e. what God sent through his messenger. 

6049. 33:36 [5]. It is not for believers to take their own opinions over judgments decided upon by God and his messenger. The 
convention 'God and his messenger 1 is appealed to ad nauseam by the Traditionalist to lend credence to his religion - one he 
himself admits, when pressed, to be largely - if not entirely - absent from the Qur'an. The Traditionalist would have us 
accept three assumptions. Firstly, that the actions of Muhammad the man constitute those of 'the messenger secondly, that 
the mass of stories ascribed to Muhammad by Persian scribes centuries after his life constitute a reliable historical record of 
Muhammad's actions; thirdly, that the expression 'obey God and his messenger 1 indicates a Qur'anic requirement for 
incorporating this extra-Qur'anic library into the process of understanding what God requires of those believers who accept 
the Qur'an. Regarding the first point, we should note that a careful reading of the present surrounding context makes clear 
that whatever is meant in the Qur'an by 'God and his messenger 1 applied here also to Muhammad (what follows at 33:37 
serves to bring Muhammad himself into compliance with Qur'anic directives since one clearly detects, in the third and fourth 
clauses of 33:37, a reluctance on the part of Muhammad - one which, in that context, may logically be taken only to indicate 
unwillingness to act on the Qur'anic judgment that the divorced wife of an adopted son may legally be taken to wife - a point 
which is implicit at 33:4). This assertion finds support in the presence of 'command' (' amr ) - which word comprises the key 
note of the main argument - at the end of 33:37. Thus, Muhammad the man - as a believing man (cf. first clause of 33:36) - 
is obliged to obey 'God and his messenger '. This fact renders the Traditionalist's first assumption false, which - when owned - 
leaves his second and third postulations redundant. 

6050. 33:37 [2]. See note to 2:2. 

6051. 33:37 [3], Sc. thou hadstgone astray in obvious error (cf. last clause of 33:36). Ellipses is required, in my opinion, by dint of 
both the context and the structure. What 'God reveals’ can, in the context, treat of one thing only: the original point that the 
divorced wife of an adopted son may legally be taken to wife, which is implicit at 33:4. Before taking up arms against the 
suggestion that Muhammad might in any way err, one should consider the following Qur'anic verses: 6:34-35, 8:67-68, 9:43, 
9:113,16:37, 17:73-75,18:23-24, 28:56, 33:37, 48:2, 66:1, 80:1-2.

the Traditionalist insists upon), but also to attest to its authenticity.

perform (the or one’s) duty. At this point the Traditionalist's value for salla as a verb denoting the performance of a five-times 
daily ritual found nowhere in the Qur'an fails him and he renders the verb in this instance as to bless or to confer blessing. I 
merely continue using the same value as I do throughout, namely that of duty. The duty incumbent upon God and his angels 
is to guide us (which is God's part of our covenant with him as per 1:6-7).

6085. 33:52 [1], Any ambiguity in the Arabic whether what is meant here is in addition to or after this time is cleared up by 
reviewing all instances of ba‘du (2:230, 5:115, 8:75, 26:120, 30:4, 33:52, 47:4, 57:10, 95:7). More importantly, the salient 
point is crystal clear: the allowances listed here (and those things found through to and including 33:57) refer to the life of 
the prophet and those of his wives and other believers of that time and the relations between them, and thus can have no 
implication for or application to any other person or community. Without cognisance of this primary fact any other 
inferences we draw have no coordinates. 

6086. 33:52 [2], The Traditionalist forwards a number of calumnious claims against the prophet, including that of marriage to a 
child as well as taking more wives than the number allowed by the Qur'an. None of these claims find any support in the 
Qur'an. Supporters of the idea that Muhammad took many wives must ignore the fact that the operative word at 33:52 is 
exchange; if the prophet were not bound by the Qur'anic limit of four wives any exchange would be redundant. The fact is 
this that the wording here suggests exactly how many wives the prophet had: four.

6091. 33:53 [9], Lit.: them. Grammar: the Arabic allows us to see that this refers to a feminine plural object which can only mean 
his wives. 

6092. 33:53 [10]. These verses protect the wives of the prophet from the slightest compromise. They have been offered the chance 
to leave the prophet and be released from their bond to him. We do not know if any chose this route. We do know that those 
who stayed freely complied with an etiquette befitting their station and that of their husband. For other people to practice 
this level of scrupulosity is excessive - even presumptuous - when their own station is of a different order.

perform (the or one’s) duty. Here the duty is that God and his angels protect the honour of the prophet against future 
marriages to his wives, thus also safeguarding the community from strife and division.

6099. 33:56 [2], Arabic: s-l-w. I.e. to do such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salla means to 
perform (the or one’s) duty. The duty binding upon the believers in the current context is found at the beginning of 33:50 (to 
arrive on time and not to enter the prophet's house early). With this comes the injunction to greet with a salutation (that is: 
loudly and clearly to announce one's presence before entering his house and not to enter it without permission) for the 
purposes of protecting the modesty of the occupants, but also that there should be no doubt as to the chastity of a wife (for 
reasons which in this context include ensuring complete moral transparency and integrity in the houses of the prophet). The 
Qur'an does not say we are to greet the prophet - though the Traditionalist assumes that it does and often ‘translates' 
accordingly: it says we are to greet. In recognition of the lamentable and undeniable need to overstate the obvious, I would 
add that the prophet is now dead. Just as there is today no need to arrive at his house on time, there is also no need to greet 
either him or his wives. The Traditionalist's practice of pouring honorifics upon a dead person and ‘greeting' him as part of 
his prayer ritual has no basis in the Qur'an, is a clear case of shirk, and borders on necromancy. This sort of deviation from 
clear and obvious good sense is one result of accepting values for Qur’anic terms derived from an external, extraneous 
literature. 

6100. 33:56 [3], It is a revealed principle to greet each person with a greeting at least as good as one receives (4:86). The context 
here (33:53 onwards) is clearly one in which the prophet is alive. Respect for the prophet is best demonstrated by following 
the one document which bears his seal of approval: the Qur'an.

6118. 33:62 [2]. Arabic: sunnah. I.e. communication of God's message followed by rejection and destruction or (occasionally) by 
acceptance and submission. See also 3:137,17:77, 33:62, 35:43, 48:23. 

6119. 33:63 [2], The Traditionalist knows better, of course, and has a complex eschatology of his own devising based on his 
favourite body of fiction which he ascribes to a messenger he claims to love. The lead character in this voluminous 
compilation of imaginative hagiographies demonstrates extensive knowledge about the end of the world: what to look for, 
and - most importantly - whom to expect to come and sort out all the problems (i.e. the mahdi ), a personality nowhere 
found in the Qur'an. The invention and propagation of external saviours is standard operating procedure in the creation and 
management of passive, fatalistic, unproductive societies of the kind the Traditionalist exemplifies (cf. 8:53). 

6120. 33:63 [4], External cataclysms notwithstanding, this life is but a second and gone; death is certain, and when it comes it will 
seem that life lasted mere moments.

6153. 34:9 [4], Arabic: aya. See Article X. 

6154. 34:10 [2], Arabic: awwaba. This form II verb occurs once. Its core senses are to return (specifically at night). The form II verb 
is said to have meanings of to return with praise of God or to echo with his praise. While attractive, such values seem 
interpretative rather than authentic in nature. My view is that return at night is the core sense and that this is supported by 
mention of birds which return nightly to their places. I regard the masculine pronoun object [it, him) as referencing the 
nearest appropriate subject which is bounty from us in the preceding clause. I then see the reference to mountains as follows: 
each day brings the mountains out of invisibility and into visibility, and each night draws them back again; the mountains are 
associated with this temporal life since they will last until the Hour. The immediate sense is that God gave Dawud bounty in 
each day, and the implication is that we should seek the same. That is my understanding, and God knows best. See also 
38:18.

6156. 34:11 [1], The Traditionalist typically makes claims for the text here which are not justified by the words on the page

and calculate [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness]...]". Muhammad Asad, on the other hand, notes: The 
adjective sabigh [fern, sabighan) signifies anything that is "ample", "abundant" and "complete" (in the sense of being perfect). In

its plural form sabighat it assumes the function of the noun which it is meant to qualify, and denotes, literally, "things (or 
"deeds"] ample and complete" or "perfect" - i.e., good deeds done abundantly and without stint: cf. the only other Quranic 
instance of the same stem in 31:20- "[God] has lavished (asbagha) upon you His blessings". The noun sard, on the other hand, 
denotes something "carried on consecutively", or something the parts (or stages) whereof are "following one another steadily", 
i.e., are continued or repeated. I see no mention of chain mail in the text and concur with Asad's reasoning.

6164. 34:16 [2]. Muhammad Asad comments here: Lit., "the flooding of the dams" (sayl ai-'arim). The date of that catastrophe 
cannot be established with any certainty, but the most probable period of the first bursting of the Dam ofMa'rib seems to have 
been the second century of the Christian era. The kingdom of Sheba was largely devastated, and this led to the migration of 
many southern (Qahtan) tribes towards the north of the Peninsula. Subsequently, it appears, the system of dams and dykes was 
to some extent repaired, but the country never regained its earlier prosperity; and a few decades before the advent of Islam the 
great dam collapsed completely and finally. This may reasonably be claimed by the Arabia Felix thesis as a point in its favour 
(see Article XVIII).

But they said: Long has our lord made the

And they wronged their souls. 


6165. 34:18 [1], Arabic: zahirun - visible, dominant, manifest, visible, conspicuous. 

6166. 34:19 [1], There are two readings here; I have opted for the second based on what I see as the superior reasoning of 
Muhammad Asad, but I will provide the reader both scenarios. One common reading, as given by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, is: But 
they said, "Our Lord! Place longer distances between our journey-stagesf..]. His comment, reproduced in full is: The people of 
Saba were given every chance. They had prosperity, skill, trade and commerce, and a healthy and beautiful country. They also 
had, apparently great virtues, and as long as they remained true to their virtues, i.e., to the law of God, they remained happy 
and contented. But when they became covetous and selfish, and became jealous of other people’s prosperity instead of rejoicing 
in it, they fell from grace and declined. It may be that the climate changed, the rainfall became scantier, perhaps on account of 
the cutting down of hill forests: trade routes changed, on account of the people falling off in the virtues that make men popular: 
behind all the physical causes was the root-cause, that they began to worship mammon, self, greed, or materialism. They fell into 
the snare of Satan. They gradually passed out of history, and became only a name in a story. Moral: it is only God’s Mercy that 
can give true happiness or prosperity, and happiness or prosperity is only a snare unless used for the highest service of God and 
man. I incline towards the reasoning and reading (which I have followed) of Muhammad Asad whose comment at this point I 
also reproduce in full: In its generally-accepted spelling - based on the reading adopted by most of the early scholars of Medina 
and Kufah - the above phrase reads in the vocative rabbana and the imperative ba'id ("Our Sustainer! Make long the distances 
..." etc.], which, however, cannot be convincingly explained. On the other hand, Tabari, Baghawi and Zamakhshari mention, on 
the authority of some of the earliest Quf an-commentators, another legitimate reading of the relevant words, namely, rabbuna 
(in the nominative) and ba’ada (in the indicative), which gives the meaning adopted by me: "Long has our Sustainer made the 
distances ..." etc. To my mind, this reading is much more appropriate since (as pointed out by Zamakhshari) it expresses the 
belated regrets and the sorrow of the people of Sheba at the devastation of their country, the exodus of large groups of the 
population, and the resultant abandonment of many towns and villages on the great caravan routes.

part - commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every person has to acknowledge God's authority (see

for the messenger to warn such people since he would be preaching to the converted.

in human life as such. (Cf. 2:20 - "if God so willed, He could indeed take away their hearing and their sight".] 

6327. 36:67 [2], Muhammad Asad's refined sentiments are of service to us here also: I.e., if it had been God’s will that men should

word summoned (28:61, 30:16, 34:38, 36:32, 36:53, 36:75, 37:57, 37:127, 37:158) which invariably treats of being brought 
before the judgment seat of God; thus, I take the sense here to be that those ‘gods other than God’ are no more than ‘a force 
summoned' (i.e. before the judgment seat of God) on that Day; i.e. commanded to be present and sent to Hell; cf. 37:22-26.

6382. 37:88 [1], Lit.: contemplated with contemplation. 

6383. 37:89 [1], I treat this clause and the one preceding as parenthetical to the main narrative. Typically, the text is rendered 
along the lines of ’casting a look at the stars'. While such is an acceptable rendering of the verb, to contemplate is also 
admissible - and both more likely and more in keeping with the broader narrative given 6:76-78. Moreover, if one sincerely 
considers the night sky, the quackery, fakery and vanity which constitutes what most are trained to think of as life pales into 
nothingness.

6386. 37:102 [1], Lit.: striving, running. 

6387. 37:102 [4], The verb in this clause is the same in the Arabic (as in the English) as in the words of Ibrahim above. Ibrahim saw 
a dream. He then asked his son what he saw, so it is reasonable to conclude that a dream is implied in this second case also. 
Whatever the details, the Qur'anic narrative has Ibrahim and Isma‘11 agreeing together on the matter. Unlike the Jewish Bible 
in its present state, Abraham does not independently decide to sacrifice his son on the basis of no consultation.

6404. 37:130 [1], Typically identified with Old Testament Elijah. While I remain unconvinced by his argument on this point, 
Muhammad Asad illustrates for us the problems here: The form Il-Yasin in which this name appears in the above verse is either 
a variant of Ilyas (Elijah) or, more probably, a plural - "the Elijahs" - meaning "Elijah and his followers" (Tabari, Zamakhshari, 
et al). According to Tabari, Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud used to read this verse as "Peace be upon Idrasin", which, apart from giving us 
a variant or a plural of Idris ("Idris and his followers"), lends support to the view that Idris and Ilyas are but two designations of 
one and the same person, the Biblical Elijah. My own view is that we should suspend judgment on this point in the absence of 
objective data.

6422. 37:164 [1], I treat the portion at 37:164-166 as an aside; firstly, because I regard it as referencing ’the pure-hearted servants 
of God' which is the dominant motif in the chapter (37:40, 37:74, 37:128, 37:160, 37:169) - and a collocation which occurs 
nowhere outside it - but also because 37:165 and 37:166 both refer back to established concepts within the chapter (at 37:1 
and 37:143 respectively); neither 'those lined up' nor ’givers of glory' occur anywhere in the text outside in the verses 
mentioned here. The import of this segment, as I understand it, is that each person who pertains to 'the pure-hearted 
servants of God' has his own 'appointed station' or particular mission (cf. 2:125). Some think that the present verse treats of 
the angels (cf. 37:150).

6450. 38:10 [2], Arabic: asbdb - ropes, means, connections; relations; pathways; causes, reasons. The root sense is that of connecting 
things. I understand the purport to be: if they claim to have mastery over the heavens and the earth, then let them ascend into 
the underlying causes thereof. Of course, men cannot do this - which would be fine if they admitted as much. 

6451. 38:11 [1], I.e. upon encountering and rejecting the message of their messenger. 

6452. 38:11 [1], This is a pivotal, crucial clause and absent any methodical approach to textual values has resulted in wild guessing 
as to its meaning. A. J. Arberry has: A very host of parties is routed there! M.K. Shakir has: A host of deserters of the allies shall 
be here put to flight. Muhammad Asad has: [But] there it is: any and all human beings, however [strongly] leagued together, are 
bound to suffer defeat [whenever they refuse to accept the truth], N. J. Dawood has: Their faction is no more than a beaten 
army. Saheeh International has: [They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers], 
Abdullah Yusuf Ali has: But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates. The translators cited, then, understand two 
things: a) that there is a host of some kind and b) that host is defeated. What their presentations lack is any demonstration of 
the import of - and connection between - these two facts. Part of their problem is that they are trying to work blind: they 
have no pan-textual method; they do not understand the system of Qur'anic definitions; they do not understand the function 
of bal in 38:8 or of the hanging am at 38:9-10, and on top of that they are obliged to deal with the sandstorm of the 
Traditionalist's extraneous narrative interpolation. Under such circumstances it would be surprising if they were able to 
demonstrate any clarity. I will unpick the present clause within the framework of the methodology used here before going 
on to demonstrate what it means. Firstly, jund is a collective noun rendered force throughout (19:75, 36:28, 36:75, 37:173, 
38:11, 44:24, 67:20) and indicates a group directed towards an aim of some kind, usually - though not always - with a

military aspect; secondly, hundlika means there [at that place ) or thereupon and is rendered in this second mode throughout 
(3:38, 7:119, 10:30, 18:44, 25:13, 33:11, 38:11, 40:78, 40:85); thirdly, we have the verb hazama. It occurs twice as a verb at 
(2:251, 54:45) and once (here) as a passive participle. The first instance of the verb treats of the victory of the children of 
Isra’Il under Talut (in which Dawud slew Jalut) while the second instance treats of the inevitability of victory over the forces 
of denial (after a rehearsal of the defeat of Fir'awn). Hence, both contexts unquestionably treat of defeat, which may safely be 
relied upon as the value here (in passive mode). Fourthly, the plural noun al ahzab is rendered by me as the parties 
throughout. A careful reading of all instances (11:17, 13:36, 19:37, 33:20, 33:20, 33:22, 38:11, 38:13, 40:30, 43:65) makes 
clear that this term has a particular meaning: it denotes those groups or factions into which men fall based on their reaction 
to the message given by God. That is: al ahzab are those who encounter and (usually) reject the message brought by the 
messenger (this point is made explicitly here at 38:13-14). We are left with the meaning of ma and min. The latter 
consistently means among or of and is rendered thus here. The particle ma (which follows junb ) has a range of meanings. 
However, following an indefinite noun (as here) it means some, certain (for example yawman ma - some day, sometime in the 
future). The correct rendering is therefore: Some force is thereupon defeated among the parties. To understand what this 
means we need to understand that the tone and content of the lead-up from the beginning of the chapter treats of the 
confrontation and defeat of the ruling elite of the day. On a verse-by-verse basis: 38:1 evokes the Qur'an; 38:2 states that 
those who are indifferent to warning are lost; 38:3 reminds of the destruction of previous communities; 38:4-5 cite 
amazement at being warned by one of their own, and subsequent accusations against the message-bearer; 38:6-7 list initial 
strategies on the part of the ruling elite to refute the message; 38:8 gives a true assessment of the condition of those warned; 
38:9-10 posit a challenge to two positions which fundamentally underpin the position supported by the ruling elite which is: 
let them ascend into the causes! - i.e. make the heavens and the earth obey them. However, the fact is that they do not have 
the treasures of the mercies of God nor do they have the dominion of the heavens and the earth (cf. 38:9-10); they have 
smoke, mirrors and threats. Thus, they and their claims are exposed. The crucial import of 38:11 lies in the fact that it is at 
this point (i.e. having taken the argument to this point) that some force is thereupon defeated among the parties. This is the 
equivalent of serving a writ or reading someone their rights. After this point they are guilty and liable to punishment - a 
juncture made explicitly at 38:12-15. Cf. 39:71. This is a central point and entirely consonant with the value of the 
muqatta'at found at 38:1 after which this chapter is named; see Article XX.

life and regarding them as teachers in the science of drawing closer to God by repenting of one's own faults and sins rather 
than being quick to judge and condemn others.

Until it 6481 disappeared behind the partition. 


6478. 38:31 [1], Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here: Safinat: literally, horses that stand, when at ease, on three legs, firmly planted, 
with the hoof of the fourth leg resting lightly on the ground. This would imply breeding and a steady temper, to match with the 
quality of swiftness mentionedj...]. 

6479. 38:32 [1], I agree with both Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Muhammad Asad who render this passage in the same tenor as have I, a 
way which is at odds with many Traditionalists who have Sulayman hacking his horses into pieces at 38:33 - something 
which is nowhere found in the Arabic (and I do not pretend to be able to explain the reason for their hallucinations). 
Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here: The story is not found in the Old Testament. / interpret it to mean that, like his father David, 
Solomon was also most meticulous in not allowing the least motive of self to be mixed up with his spiritual virtues. He was fond 
of horses: he had great armies and wealth; but he used them all in God’s service[...]. His battles were not fought for lust of blood, 
but as Jihads in the cause of righteousness. His love of horses was not like that of a mere race-goer or of a warrior: there was a 
spiritual element in it. He loved by a kind of love which was spiritual—the love of the highest Good. 

6480. 38:32 [1], Arabic: dhikr- calling to mind, recalling, reminding: remembrance (of something past): history. 

6481. 38:32 [2], Grammar: the verb here is in the feminine singular, agreeing with shams (sun) which is obliquely referenced by 
virtue of the fact that we know that it is evening ( c ashiyya ). Traditionalist interpretations vary for 38:31-33. The facts as I see 
them are: Sulayman loved horses out of love for God (seeing God's hand in their creation and maintenance): the sun then 
went away (which indicated that it was time for prayer): Sulayman stopped for prayer after which he asked for the horses to 
be brought back to him: he then anointed or stroked their necks and legs (the word is mash from which we get masih or 
anointed one) as would anyone who loves horses. The lesson is simple: you can have good things in abundance and keep a 
right attitude towards them.

6482. 38:34 [1], See note on fitnah to 2:102. 

6483. 38:34 [2], While I do not share his pre-existing allegiance to the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis (see Article XVIII), I 
reproduce Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here in full: The body (without life) on his throne has been variously interpreted. The 
interpretation that appeals to me most is that his earthly power, great as it was, was like a body without a soul, unless it was 
vivified by God's spirit. But Solomon did turn to God in true devotion, and his real power lay there. He did his best to root out 
idolatry, and he completed the Temple in Jerusalem for the worship of the One True God. Cf. his conversion ofBilqis the Queen of 
Sheba, 27:40. See also 7:148, where the same word jasad is used in connection with the image of a calf which the Israelites had 
set up for worship in the absence of Moses. Men may worship worldly Power as they may worship an idol, and there is great 
temptation in such Power, though Solomon withstood such temptation)...]. Muhammad Asad's comment adds to those 
provided by Abdullah Yusuf Ali: To explain this verse, some of the commentators advance the most fantastic stories, almost all 
of them going back to Talmudic sources. Razi rejects them all, maintaining that they are unworthy of serious consideration. 
Instead, he plausibly suggests that the "body" (jasad) upon Solomon's throne is an allusion to his own body, and - metonymically 
- to his kingly power, which was bound to remain "lifeless" so long as it was not inspired by God-willed ethical values. (It is to be 
borne in mind that in classical Arabic a person utterly weakened by illness, worry or fear, or devoid of moral values, is often 
described as "a body without a soul".) In other words, Solomon’s early trial consisted in his inheriting no more than a kingly 
position, and it rested upon him to endow that position with spiritual essence and meaning.

retain thine integrity? Curse God, and die." According to the classical Qud an-commentators, Job swore that, if God would restore 
him to health, he would punish her blasphemy with a hundred stripes. But when he did recover, he bitterly regretted his hasty 
oath, for he realized that his wife’s "blasphemy" had been an outcome of her love and pity for him; and thereupon he was told in 
a revelation that he could fulfil his vow in a symbolic manner by striking her once with "a bunch of grass containing a hundred 
blades or more". (Cf. 5:89 - "God will not take you to task for oaths which you may have uttered without thought.") Also of 
interest is the fact is that the Arabic here d iahth means bunch, mixed bunch, something muddled (such as flowers, grasses, 
thoughts).

Fall down 6505 


6502. 38:69 [1], Arabic: al mala'. I generally render this eminent ones, however, I have adapted it here to the context. Cf. 37:8. 

6503. 38:69 [1], The Traditionalist claims something different for the messenger, such as an ascension into heaven and an 
argument with God as to the number of prayers. This sort of speculation is more in keeping with a Talmudic worldview and 
is something I reject on the basis of clear Qur'anic statements such as the one found here; cf. 17:1 and note. 

6504. 38:70 [1], Arabic: wahiand awha. See 3:44. Lit.: it is instructed to me. 

6505. 38:72 [2], Arabic: waqa'a. This verb has two key meanings in the text depending on the preposition it uses (for the full set of 
instances of this form I verb see 4:100, 7:31, 7:118, 7:134, 10:51, 15:29, 22:65, 27:82, 27:85, 38:72, 56:1, 69:15). As a rule, it 
means to occur, to befall. It is true (as per the Traditionalist's claim) that it also means to fall down. However, in this instance 
it is found with the preposition la. The Traditionalist wishes the reader to think that it means to fall down to him. The reason 
he wants this is that if he can get us to ascribe a purely physical value to the s-j-d root, he can begin to shoehorn his religion 
(i.e. inject something extraneous to the Qur'an while claiming it to be its natural corollary) into the mind of the reader on 
that basis. However, waqa'a does not normally take an object when it means to fall down and it does not take one with la

except in its other sense of to befall (something befell him would take la before him). The verb sajada, however, does take la

commendation of following the evidence supplied by one's reason (hujjat al-'aql], and of reaching one’s conclusions in 
accordance with [the results of] critical examination (nazar) and logical inference (istidlal)." A somewhat similar view is

6575. 39:28 [1], Classical Arabic is not a holy language; it does possess certain useful characteristics, among which is the fact that it 
is possible to demonstrate values with reference to usage and root meanings in a way which is not possible - at least in the 
same way and to the same extent - in, for example, English. That the Qur'an claims to be 'free of deviation' points, at least in 
part, to the consistency present within it - the reality of which the current work attempts to reveal and free from the 
accretions imposed upon it in the name of religion.

they came to be as He willed them to be...: and this is the kind of metaphor (majaz) which is called 'allegory' (tamthil)... Thus, 
the purport [of this passage] is but an illustration [taswir] of the effect of His almighty power on all that is willed [by Him], and 
nothing else...." [It is obvious that Zamakhshari's reasoning is based on the oft-repeated Qur'anic statement, "When God wills a 
thing to be, He but says unto it, 'Be' - and it is."] Concluding his interpretation of the above passage, Zamakhshari adds: "If I am 
asked about the meaning of [the words] 'willingly or unwillingly', / say that it is a figurative expression (mathal) indicating that 
His almighty will must inevitably take effect."

6849. 42:13 [5], Arabic; sh-r-k. See 6:78 and Article VIII. 

6850. 42:13 [5], This is palpably true in a sense broader than generally understood. Religion-worship is a form of idolatry. 
Nowhere is there found a religion (in the sense of formulas, dogma and priests) in the Qur'an. Personal and social initiative 
to deliver a message of good news and warning in combination with personal and communal piety informed by set

However, it does so only where it takes an object using the preposition bi. Where it takes a direct object (as here) it means 
either to fluster, flurry, disquiet or to find light (the case here clearly that of swaying or sweeping or carrying along a person 
away from or towards a position) or to deem light (i.e. to carry) - the former set of connotations being correct in this case. 
The two senses are connected by the core concept which is to find easy to move (from place, position or opinion). It occurs in 
the first sense at 30:60 and here at 43:54, and in the second sense at 16:80.

[see Lane p. 1668); Muhammad Asad does similarly, rendering as ‘raise an outcry’. 

6987. 43:58 [2]. In my opinion, this is an example of the use of a disingenuous argument, one which assumes the premise it 
requires (in this case that ‘Isa was a ‘god') in order to generate a predetermined reaction; it is a standard rhetorical device, 
known popularly as the Straw Man. One sees it used in debates of all kinds, including by professional atheists and 
religionists today. The tactic consists in first misrepresenting the case one wishes to attack, and then appearing to beat that 
case apart on the basis of one's own positions.

only (Matt. 24:36); a position confirmed several times in the Qur'an, for example at 41:47. I think the edifice of extraneous 
and, perhaps, faulty Christian eschatology is what is being refuted here and brought into line with Matt. 24:36. Others think 
this pronoun refers to the Qur'an as a whole. 

6990. 43:61 [2], Grammar: the feminine object pronoun refers to the Hour.

7007. 43:79 [1], Arabic: am. See note to 21:21. 

7008. 43:79 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The verb barama or abrama signifies, literally, "he twined" or "twisted 
[something] together", e.g., the strands that are to form a rope; or "he twisted [something] well" or "strongly". Tropically, it 
connotes the act of "establishing" or "determining" a thing, a proposition, a course of events, etc. [Jawhari], According to the 
Lisan al-Arab, the phrase abrama al-amr has the meaning of "he determined (ahkama) the case". In the present context, the 
term amr, having no definite article, signifies "anything" or - in its widest sense - "anything that should [or "could"] be": and so, 
taking the preceding verse into account, we arrive at the meaning of arbitrarily "determining what [the truth] should be" - i.e., 
in contradiction to what the Qur'an postulates as the truth. 

7009. 43:79 [1], I.e. if this is the claim: that they have power over any matter. 

7010. 43:79 [2], Cf. the maxim man proposes but God disposes which comes down to us in translation from the Latin of Thomas a 
Kempis' The Imitation of Christ.

7024. 43:88 [1], My opinion is that this masculine pesonal pronoun refers to Isa (the only person to say my lord in the chapter)

7034. 44:10 [1], We have obvious smoke in the sky in the form of the covert program currently denied by the ruling elite popularly 
known as chemtrails. Whether what we see now is the final fulfilment of this warning I cannot say. However, the fact is that 
we have 'obvious smoke’ (obvious at least to those who trust the eyes in their head over what they are told by mainstream 
media) in the sky. 

7035. 44:12 [1], Arabic: (al) mu'minun. See note to 8:2. 

7036. 44:13 [1], I.e. when people have been warned there is no further requirement for their destruction. My personal thought is 
that if this section refers - as it seems to - to the industrial-scale spraying of the world's skies by all governments (many of 
which are ostensibly in conflict on other fronts), and that the suffering of those thus afflicted is alluded to here. The massive 
propaganda against the Qur'an originating in the actions of 'terrorist' groups (all of which happen to forward New World 
Order agendas) as well as in the ignorance, immorality and intellectual torpidity among those who claim to be Muslims does 
not mitigate the responsibility a man has to investigate the Qur'an on its merits when it reaches him, or his accountability 
when he turns away from warning based on the same. 

7037. 44:14 [1], These are two of the accusations which certain among the Jews, Christians, Orientalists - and the Traditionalist (at 
times) - level at Muhammad: that he received his information from others, or that he was possessed. If one cares to read 
what the messenger himself brought - the Qur'an - rather than extraneous materials, one finds these accusations 
comprehensively addressed.

7042. 44:31 [1], Arabic: fir'awn. See note to 2:49. 

7043. 44:32 [1], I.e. the children of Isra’Il. 

7044. 44:32 [1], Muhammad Asad (himself a Jew) comments here: I.e., according to all commentators, above all people of their time, 
because at that time the children of Israel were the only people who worshipped the One God: which is the reason of the frequent 
Qur'anic references to the story of their delivery from bondage. The stress on God’s having "chosen them knowingly" alludes to 
His foreknowledge that in later times they would deteriorate morally and thus forfeit His grace (Zamakhshari and Razi], Cf. 
45:23 where the construction ‘according to knowledge’ references an entirely different subset of humanity. 

7045. 44:33 [1], I.e. the children of Isra’Il. 

7046. 44:33 [1], Arabic: aydt. See Article X. 

7047. 44:33 [1], While Muhammad Asad (himself a Jew) assumes the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis (see Article XVIII), his 
comments here are beneficial: [..fan allusion to the long line of prophets raised in their midst, as well as to the freedom and 
prosperity which they were to enjoy in the Promised Land. All this presaged a test of their sincerity with regard to the spiritual 
principles which in the beginning raised them "above all other people" and, thus, of their willingness to act as God’s message- 
bearers to all the world. The formulation of the above sentence implies elliptically that they did not pass that test inasmuch as 
they soon forgot the spiritual mission for which they had been elected, and began to regard themselves as God’s "chosen people" 
simply on account of their descent from Abraham: a notion which the Qur'an condemns in many places. Apart from this, the 
majority of the children of Israel very soon lost their erstwhile conviction that the life in this world is but the first and not the 
final stage of human life, and - as their Biblical history shows - abandoned themselves entirely to the pursuit of material 
prosperity and power. 

7048. 44:34 [1], Muhammad Asad's final comment on this point is supplied for the sake of completeness: Although, on the face of it, 
by "these people" the Israelites are meant, the reference is obviously a general one, applying to all who hold the views expressed 
in the sequence, and in particular to the pagan contemporaries of the Prophet Muhammad. Nevertheless, there is a subtle 
connection between this passage and the preceding allusion to the "test" with which the children of Israel were to be faced: for it 
is a historical fact that up to the time of the destruction of the Second Temple and their dispersion by the Roman emperor Titus, 
the priestly aristocracy among the jews, known as the Sadducees, openly denied the concepts of resurrection, divine judgment 
and life in the hereafter, and advocated a thoroughly materialistic outlook on life.

to mean ‘religious legal system’ something like an ‘Islamic’ equivalent of the Christian Total Society envisaged by St. 
Augustine and given feet and teeth by Charlemagne. However, this is a later value - one coined, one assumes, by those who 
created or benefited from such a system. This is the only instance of this world in the Qur'an. Cf. note to 5:48. Muhammad 
Asad comments here: It is to be borne in mind that the literal meaning of the term shari'ah is "the way to a watering-place", 
and since water is indispensable for all organic life, this term has in time come to denote a "system of laws", both moral and 
practical, which shows man the way towards spiritual fulfilment and social welfare: hence, "religious law" in the widest sense of 
the term.

7149. 46:10 [1], I am including Abdullah Yusuf Ali’s comment here for interest. While I neither agree with his assessment that 
'Islam' is a religion (at least, not in the sense that he means it) nor with some of his other assumptions, I think his general 
point here is pertinent enough to merit consideration: Another side of the argument is now presented, You pagan Arabs! You 
are puffed up with pride, though you are an ignorant nation. Among Israel there are men who understand the previous 
scriptures, and who find the Qur'an and its Preacher a true confirmation of the previous scriptures. They accept Islam as a 
fulfilment of the revelation of Moses himself! (See Deut 18:18-19). And yet you hold back, though the Qur'an has come in your 
own language, in order to help you to understand. How unjust and how shameful! In that case, with what face can you seek 
guidance from God?' 

7150. 46:10 [4], Said to indicate an Israelite. I think Abdullah Yusuf Ali's assertion above is further borne out by the use of the verb 
istakbarra (to be proud] which is associated with the rejection of messengers by the children of Isra'fl (2:88), a situation 
which is both offset and augmented by this statement.

7230. 47:13 [1], At this point in the Qur'anic narrative the messenger has been evicted from his city - an event entirely in keeping 
with the prophetic tradition Muhammad was following as outlined in the Qur'an. Under the Petra thesis that city is Petra. 
The Arabia Felix thesis advances a location in the Yemen region. Under the Traditionalist's assertions, Muhammad was from 
Makkah. As stated before, objective evidence for Traditionalist's claim is conspicuous by its absence. As ever, more work on 
the ground is needed. See Article XVIII.

7233. 47:14 [1], This introduces two questions. The first follows immediately: the second comes near the end of 47:15. The 
relationship between the two and the initial question here is demonstrated by the use in both cases of ka [like) and the third

7296. 48:9 [2], To me this is smoking-gun Qur’anic evidence that the expression God and his messenger refers, finally, to God alone 
[a point which is doubly confirmed in the beginning of the next verse) since there is no sense ever implied that worship is for 
anyone other than God - a point with which the Traditionalist will agree. So why not simply say God and leave out his 
messenger ? Had that been the formulation those who already believed in God could have said Well, we do believe in God - and 
they would have been right (I am indebted to Brother Hamza Abdul Malik for this insight). Just as there is no second Torah 
(as the Rabbinic Jews contend, indicating thereby the Mishnah and, by extension, the Talmud), so there is no second Qur'an 
(which, in effect, is what the Traditionalist would like us to believe, indicating thereby the hadith literature).

that following the same pattern in n-k-b means disaster, I acknowledge Brother Ayman for this point). However, even if 
the word is claimed as a proper noun denoting a physical location, the city of Petra fits that description as it comprises an 
enclosed valley and is thus very much belly-like. The city today called Makkah fails to impress on this latter count entirely: it 
is no secret that many Traditionalist Muslims return from pilgrimage to Makkah confused and disappointed, finding the 
geography at odds with Qur'anic descriptions. See Article XVIII.

particular construction (comprising requirement and the verb to reach ) occurs here and at 2:196. Having considered the 
contexts of both, it is my opinion that this is a collocation describing expectations; thus, the sense here is merely what should

7332. 48:25 [6], Arabic: tazayyala. This form V verb occurs only once in the Qur'an so it is impossible to grasp its sense by means 
of comparison with other instances. Lane has nothing of use to say about it and Wehr passes over it. Badawi-Haleem and 
Penrice serve no good purpose here other than placing in dictionary format the assumptions long agreed upon by the 
Traditionalist. Hava provides no detail. Steingass alone references this form which he dispatches tersely thus: be separated, 
dissolved. Whether this agrees with Traditionalist mouthpieces Badawi-Haleem and Penrice because they are in fact correct 
or because finding nothing else Steingass decided to use their assertions, I cannot tell. I am suspicious since both Wehr and 
Lane - who have no theological axe to grind - do not comment on this verb. The preponderance of uses of this verb (in form 
I) gives a value of to cease (2:217, 5:13, 9:110, 11:118, 13:31, 21:15, 22:55, 40:34). The form II occurs at 10:28 and with the 
use of the preposition baina means to separate. This leaves us with a sole form V verb with no non-partisan dictionary 
reference. We do have the use of our reason, however. We know that form V verbs often represent the passive voice of the 
form II verb and we know what the form II verb means: to separate, break up, disperse, scatter (transitive). The passive voice 
of these senses, then, is the correct meaning. In sum, the general reading by most translators is correct, but having been 
through the process above we know not only that it is correct, but also why it is so.

7343. 48:27 [4], The point of this history is to relate the messenger's obedience to the directive he received to witness to the truth 
of God alone at al masjid al haram. It is impossible - at least Qur'anically and historically speaking - that this place was in the 
city of Makkah, and much evidence on both counts to indicate its locus as Petra in modern Jordan. In any event, al masjid al 
haram is now closed to believers (see 9:28) and was later destroyed by the earliest Muslims (see Article XVIII). The religion 
which became Islam was invented later and is in no sense the doctrine of truth mentioned in the next verse; it is simply 
another created control mechanism. The doctrine of truth is that God is one and our obligation is to serve him alone (and not

belief, then is Islam not a faith. Yet the Traditionalist claims faith as a necessary component of his religion. The reason for the 
muddle which rational and consistent analysis of the Traditionalist's claims exposes is that the Traditionalist brings his 
definitions and assumptions from outside sources and imposes them upon the Qur'an. Since such sources and the Qur’anic 
text are cut from entirely different cloth it is not only not surprising that they do not fit, it is impossible that they should (cf.

21. 

And every soul will come 


7425. 50:17 [1], Arabic: 1-q-y. The form V of this verb means to learn, to be informed; to receive; to accept, to take; to get, to obtain. 
With no preposition to give an indication which of the possible meanings is intended I have resorted to identifying the 
unifying concept behind these values (which is that of obtaining information ) on which basis I have rendered as learners. The 
form V of this verb is found at 2:37, 21:103, 24:15 and 50:17. Muhammad Asad makes an excellent point here the central 
thesis of which I accept completely. While I have not rendered after his reasoning, I see no contradiction between his 
thoughts and my choices here. He notes: The first part of the above sentence - i.e., the phrase yatalaqqa al-mutalaqqiyan - may 
be understood in either of two senses: "the two that are meant to receive do receive", or "the two that aim at meeting each other 
do meet". The classical commentators adopt, as a rule, the first sense and, consequently, interpret the passage thus: "...the two 
angels that are charged with recording man's doings - do record them, sitting on his right and on his left". In my opinion, 
however, the second of the two possible meanings ("the two that aim at meeting each other") corresponds better with the 
preceding verse, which speaks of what man's innermost self (nafs) - whispers within him", i.e., voices his subconscious desires. 
Thus, "the two that aim at meeting" are, I believe, the two demands of, or, more properly, the two fundamental motive forces 
within man's nature: his primal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual and non-sensual (all of them comprised in the 
modern psychological term "libido"), on the one side, and his reason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other. The "sitting 
(qa'id) on the right and on the left" is, to my mind, a metaphor for the conflicting nature of these dual forces which strive for 
predominance within every human being: hence, my rendering of qa'id as "contending". This interpretation is, moreover, 
strongly supported by the reference, in verse 21, to man's appearing on Judgment Day with "that which drives and that which 
bears witness" - a phrase which undoubtedly alludes to man's instinctive urges as well as his conscious reason. 

7426. 50:19 [1], Arabic: bil haqqi. See Article XIX (bil haqqi i.). 

7427. 50:20 [2], Arabic: wa'id - threats, warnings; promises.

7428. 50:21 [2], Muhammad Asad's comments here (with some light editing) are as follows: Lit., "with that which drives (sa'iq) and 
that which bears witness (shahid)". While the former term evidently circumscribes man's primal urges - and particularly those 
which drive him into unrestrained self-indulgence and, thus, into sin - the term shahd [.Jalludes here to the awakening of the 
deeper layers of man's consciousness, leading to a sudden perception of his own moral reality - the "lifting of the veil" referred to 
in the next verse - which forces him to "bear witness" against himself (cf. 17:14, 24:24, 36:65, 41:20). 

7429. 50:22 [3], Those who experience what are (somewhat incorrectly) called near-death experiences report that their powers of 
perception are expanded beyond compare with what they have in life. 

7430. 50:23 [1], This term generally treats of the shaytan (see 4:38, 4:38, 22:13, 41:25, 43:36, 43:38, 50:27).

Zamakhshari explains as meaning "is present with his intellect", i.e., with a conscious mind. (Cf. the same use of the term shahid 
in verse 21.) The conjunctive particle "or" (aw) which precedes the above clause does not signify an alternative but has - as is 
often the case in Quranic usage - an explanatory function, similar to phrases like "that is" or "in other words", followed by an 
amplification of what was said before.

charity remembers not only those in need who ask, but also those who are prevented by some reason from asking. The man of 
true charity seeks out the latter. There may be various reasons which prevent a man from asking for help: (1) he may be 
ashamed to ask, or his sense of honour may prevent him from asking: [2] he may be so engrossed in some great ideal that he 
may not think of asking: (3) he may even not know that he is in need, especially when we think of wealth and possessions in a 
spiritual sense, as including spiritual gifts and talents: (4) he may not know that you possess the things that can supply his 
needs: and (5) he may be a dumb and helpless creature, whether a human being or a dumb animal, or any creature within your 
ken or power. Charity in the higher sense includes all help, from one better endowed to one less well endowed.

7485. 51:47 [2]. Arabic: musi‘un. This is the form IV active participle from the w-s-'root. The form IV of the w-s-'root has two main 
senses: to be or become rich or wealthy, and to extend, widen or enlarge. Clearly, the two meanings are connected; the 
question is: which is meant here? Modern translations tend to use values such as enlarge or expand under the influence of 
popularised theories about the nature of the universe. The methodology here, however, is to default in all cases where there 
is a clear Qur'anic sense to that sense. On that basis, I must render as I do. Firstly, the form IV verb occurs only twice, both 
times as the active participle: here and at 2:236; at 2:236 it unambiguously means to be wealthy - a value with which all 
agree, and the context admits of nothing else. Secondly, to achieve the value of expand and synonyms here at 51:47 requires 
the addition of an object. While some translators make their own additions, such an object is absent from the text. The 
present reading is supported also at 51:56-58.

7565. 53:2 [1], The portion which follows deals with an encounter beyond the common experience of men. The Traditionalist has, 
naturally, a stock of stories to which he refers here, but which are a distraction from the main point. The key lesson of this 
part of the chapter is found at 53:19-28 where one sees that there are true witnesses to the realm of angels and there are 
false ones; that there is what truly comes from God and there is what men ascribe to God but for which God gave no warrant. 
What Muhammad personally saw, I do not know. I do not need to know. I know what matters: that it was a true encounter. 
What men choose to write about angels - including those who claim to speak for prophets - is of little interest to me and in 
no way changes what for me is the point of this chapter, which is quite the reverse of what the Traditionalist claims for it. For 
him, it is yet another opportunity to insinuate non-Qur'anic material into the mind of the reader of the Qur'an; for me, it is a 
warning against just such a practice.

7584. 53:32 [1], Arabic: lamam. This is the only instance of this noun. Little of any use is found in the lexicons. The root verb 
iamma has three core senses: that of gathering or uniting, that of visiting, and that of misfortune or mistake. It also has the 
nuance of something small or slight. In the context, it is the sense of misfortune or mistake which holds up, and I render it 
here slight mistakes. Most translators render in similar fashion. Since there is no question but that complete sexual 
continence outside of marriage is the Qur'anic standard, reading between the lines, I take lamam to indicate a man's 
unintentional sexual emissions during sleep.

qafi God keeps his promises. 

Those who believe notin the hereafter 

We have made their works fair to them so they wander blindly. 

These are they for whom is the evil of punishment 
And in the hereafter are they those most in loss. (27:4-5) 

7606. 54:1 [2], Claims are made for this verse by the Traditionalist which I ignore with the rest of his inventions. The obvious 
import of 54:1 is that of the prophetic past (a device used frequently in the Qur'an) whereby future events are given greater 
inevitability through treating them as accomplished facts; such instances are presented in English in the future tense. The 
idea opened at 54:1 is picked up and developed beginning at 54:4. While my view is in no way dependent upon that of 
Muhammad Asad - and while I do not share Asad's confidence in the ‘reports' he mentions to any degree whatever - his 
comments here are still worthy of consideration, and will be helpful in equipping the neophyte with a broader perspective: 
Most of the commentators see in this verse a reference to a phenomenon said to have been witnessed by several of the Prophet's 
contemporaries. As described in a number of reports going back to some companions, the moon appeared one night as if split 
into two distinct parts. While there is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity of these reports, it is possible that what actually 
happened was an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, which produced an equally unusual optical illusion. But whatever the 
nature of that phenomenon, it is practically certain that the above Qur'an-verse does not refer to it but, rather, to a future event: 
namely, to what will happen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur'an frequently employs the past tense to denote the 
future, and particularly so in passages which speak of the coming of the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of the past 
tense is meant to stress the certainty of the happening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghib regards it as fully justifiable to 
interpret the phrase inshaqqa 'l-qamar ("the moon is split asunder") as bearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world 
as we know it - that will occur before the coming of Resurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the Mufradat). As mentioned by 
Zamakhshari, this interpretation has the support of some of the earlier commentators; and it is, to my mind, particularly 
convincing in view of the juxtaposition, in the above Qur'an-verse, of the moon's "splitting asunder" and the approach of the 
Last Hour. (In this connection we must bear in mind the fact that none of the Qur'anic allusions to the "nearness" of the Last 
Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on the human concept of "time".)

protection against the Judgment; secondly, it serves notice to those who think arms and military might will save them: there 
is no escape from the Hour.

55:33 [2], Arabic: aqtar (pi.), qutr (sg.)- region, quarter; district, section; zone; country, land. The unifying source concept of 
this word is that of delineation between things, limits, edges or boundaries; it occurs at 33:14 and 55:33. In terms of what man 
can demonstrate by fact rather than claim by fiction, he has never drilled more than a few miles into the earth or journeyed 
higher than a modest number of miles above it - CGI, Photoshop, green-screen technology and obviously faked moon 
landings notwithstanding. (My views on these subjects are not ideologically driven; I do not care one way or the other what 
shape the earth is or how far men have travelled from it or into it. I am interested in truth. And having considered the 
evidence - rather than allowing myself to be kettled by fiction and pre-existing consensus - it is clear to me that the Space 
industry is fraudulent, a psyop the core tasks of which are to generate money for black-budget projects, to keep ‘Space' in the 
minds of the masses to facilitate further frauds aimed at steering the herd into the arms of a one world government, and to 
make men feel small and insignificant. NASA and related agencies have taken the place of the priesthood. All the spectacular 
things they claim can only be seen by them; we have to trust them for the veracity of their claims. Having looked at the 
evidence they present, I do not consider them credible witnesses in much the same way I do not consider the hadith and 
those who promulgate them credible witnesses.)

7734. 55:62 [1], Arabic: min duni. See 2:23. 

7735. 55:62 [1], Grammar: dual. The segment at 55:56-61 speaks of a plurality of gardens, as evinced by the use of the feminine 
plural object pronoun (the notion of which is resumed at 56:70) as opposed to the dual as here. In the light of this I treat 
55:56-61 parenthetically. However, at 55:62 there is a return to the dual, which fact I regard as a signal connecting this verse 
to what precedes 55:56. 

7736. 55:62 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: Most of the commentators assume - not very convincingly - that the "two other 
gardens" are those to which believers of lesser merit will attain. As against this weak and somewhat arbitrary interpretation, it 
seems to me that the juxtaposition of "two other gardens" with, the "two" previously mentioned is meant to convey the idea of 
infinity in connection with the concept of paradise as such: gardens beyond gardens beyond gardens in an endless vista, slightly 
varying in description, but all of them symbols of supreme bliss. While I agree with that part of Asad’s assertion which treats of 
an infinity of types of reward, it is clear that there exist degrees in the garden, as the next chapter makes plain; also, see note 
to 55:62 above. 

7737. 55:63 [1], Grammar: dual. 

7738. 55:63 [1], Grammar: dual. 

7739. 55:64 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: l.e., by reason of abundant watering (Taj al-'Arus). It is to be noted that the 
adjective "green" is often used in the Qur'an to indicate ever-fresh life: e.g., the "green garments" which the inmates of paradise 
will wear (18:31 and 76:21], or the "green meadows" upon which they will recline (cf. verse 76 of the present surah).

7787. 56:73 [1], Grammar: the feminine singular object pronoun relates to fire. 

7788. 56:73 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The participial noun muqw is derived from the verb qawiya, "it became deserted" 
or "desolate". From the same root is derived the noun qawa’ (or qiwa), which signifies "desert", "wilderness" or "wasteland" as 
well as "hunger" or "starvation Hence, muqw denotes "one who is hungry" as well as "one who is lost [or "who wanders"] in a 
deserted place". In the above verse this expression is evidently used tropically, for it is difficult to imagine that, as some 
commentators assume, it relates merely to "wayfarers in the desert". 

7789. 56:74 [1], Arabic: s-b-h. See 2:32. 

7790. 56:74 [1], Here begins within the qaf-nun set, in my opinion, a convention which functions as a type of altar call; it repeats 
exactly at 56:96 and 69:52 and in substance in many other places. 

7791. 56:75 [1], Contrary to well-funded 'scientific' fictions driven into the mind before the age of rational thought is reached and 
fortified endlessly by TV and cinema fictions, any objective investigation into this question by calm, adult minds shows that 
the earth is level and fixed and that the heavens go round it. 

7792. 56:77 [1], Arabic: qur'an - reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out.

7859. 57:25 [4], Or hurt, injury. 

7860. 57:25 [4], Muhammad Asad offers some interesting observations here: Side by side with enabling man to discriminate 
between right and wrong (which is the innermost purpose of all divine revelation], God has endowed him with the ability to 
convert to his use the natural resources of his earthly environment. An outstanding symbol of this ability is man's skill, unique 
among all animated beings, in making tools; and the primary material for all tool-making - and, indeed, for all human 
technology - is iron: the one metal which is found abundantly on earth, and which can be utilized for beneficial as well as 
destructive ends. The "awesome power" (ba 's shadid] inherent in iron manifests itself not merely in the manufacture of weapons 
of war but also, more subtly, in man's ever-growing tendency to foster the development of an increasingly complicated 
technology which places the machine in the foreground of all human existence and which, by its inherent - almost irresistible - 
dynamism, gradually estranges man from all inner connection with nature. This process of growing mechanization, so evident in 
our modern life, jeopardizes the very structure of human society and, thus, contributes to a gradual dissolution of all moral and 
spiritual perceptions epitomised in the concept of "divine guidance". It is to warn man of this danger that the Qur'an stresses - 
symbolically and metonymically - the potential evil (ba's) of "iron" if it is put to wrong use: in other words, the danger of man's 
allowing his technological ingenuity to run wild and thus to overwhelm his spiritual consciousness and, ultimately, to destroy all 
possibility of individual and social happiness.

with an exaggerated asceticism, often amounting to a denial of any value in the life of this world - an attitude characteristic of 
early Christianity[...] Of course, monastic asceticism goes back millennia and its practitioners have included Hindus, Jain and 
many others - something about which Asad will, naturally, have been aware. See Article XVIII. Cf. 22:40 and note thereto.

7877. 58:1 [2], Grammar: dual. 

7878. 58:2 [2], See also 33:4, the note from which I repeat here in full: The Traditionalist insists upon a fanciful, highly specialised 
interpretation here, one which assists him in his broader aim of creating an opening by which he can insinuate himself and 
his usurping literature into the mind of the reader. In summary, his assertion is that pre-Islamic Arabs would divorce their 
wives by saying that a wife was ‘like the back of' his mother and that it is this practice which the verb at this juncture 
(rendered by me as assist :) references. No support is found for this assertion in the text itself; we are expected simply to take 
the Traditionalist's word for it. If the Traditionalist could point to a history of intellectual rigour, honest research and plain 
dealing, I might be so tempted; since he cannot, I choose to verify the evidence for myself. Facts first: the form III verb based 
on zahara objectively and correctly means to assist, to help, to aid, to support - and the Traditionalist himself renders this 
form III verb in just this sense in all other instances outside of this specific context and its adjunct at 33:4 (see 9:4, 33:26, 
60:9). Allowing the verb its natural meaning (i.e. that of assisting among your wives ) fits the context exactly. The Qur'anic 
redress for those who swear off their wives (which is what the Traditionalist is claiming as the sense here though by another 
name) is entirely different and comprehensively treated at 2:226. Now to the application of reason: in a context which 
permits of limited polygamy a situation is possible in which one wife might not be able to have children while others might 
be able to have them. In such a case, a man - it may be reasoned - might decide (it is assumed within the Qur'anic principle

And whoso has not the wherewithal: 


of mutual consultation) to 'assist both the fertile and infertile wives by allowing the infertile wife to raise a child born to the 
fertile wife. Thus, the infertile wife might experience something of the joys of motherhood and the fertile wife - who may 
already have her hands full with existing children - might get support in the raising of a child. (Other comparable scenarios 
are where the husband has a child from a previous wife, or a wife brings an existing child into a marriage.) The point in such 
scenarios (i.e. in which a man 'assists’ among his wives) is that we should remember who the true mother is and not 
obfuscate that fact. These points granted, it is possible to envisage a case in which a man has allowed a wife to raise a child to 
whom she is not the natural mother and that that decision has resulted either in regret on the part of the natural mother or 
in a change of mind on the part of the man. It is surely such a case which is the subject here, i.e. one in which a man has to go 
back on this arrangement (returning a child to the care of its natural mother, thus depriving the adoptive mother of her 
charge).

7885. 58:4 [5], Qur’anic usage: The expression believe in at 58:4 requires an action in order to be valid and therefore presupposes 
something distinct from mere verbal or intellectual assent, or even an event in the heart - although all three are certainly 
some part of what is meant by believe in. In order for believe in to be achievable here one must do something: perhaps the 
expression prove faithful to better conveys in English what is implicit in the statement. From this we can deduce that in the 
Qur'anic worldview to believe in is not merely a matter of what claims or feels. It is that which governs how a man makes his 
choices in the world. With the division of church and state men have gained the impression that their religion is what they 
do - if they do so at all - for an hour in a church on a Sunday, or a in mosque on a Friday. This is a false impression. What a 
man does for an hour here and there is more properly called a hobby. It is what he does with the rest of the time which is his 
religion. Within the Qur’anic model, works are not an add-on to - or confirmation of - 'belief in'; they are a function of what 
belief in is.

it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our

7908. 58:13 [5], Arabic: atb al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation dtd al zakdt is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social 
activity of any type with an implied sexual connotation outside the bond of marriage): this value is based upon pan-textual 
analysis of contexts and usage. See Article IV.

7935. 59:7 [6], Lit.: the son of the road. Sc. and to them alone. 

7936. 59:7 [11], The central portion of 59:7 is habitually, mightily, and even comically, abused at the hands of the Traditionalist; his 
abuse of it is intended to open the floodgates to his preferred literature. It is a feint - a form of bait-and-switch - by which 
means he achieves an end-run around the psychological defences of the unwary or of those unprepared to do their own due 
diligence on the Qur'an. The context at 59:7 treats of the allocation of material things exclusively. To ascribe to it any other 
value is, frankly, deceit. The way the Traditionalist quotes this small part of one verse out of context is analogous to claiming 
that the Tanakh (Jewish Bible) says there is no God. Of course, it does indeed say that (at Psalms 14:1). However, the whole 
verse reads: The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none 
that doeth good. The Qur'an warns against those who twist the words of God (5:41). The Traditionalist’s problem here (aside 
from his requirement to find Qur'anic authority for his religion where there is none) is that he has not understood the 
concept of implicit punctuation. Verse 59:8 begins with For the poor emigresf..]. The Traditionalist translator is forced to 
insert words of his own composition here such as It is[...]. However, when we understand that there is no oversight or 
deficiency in the text, but rather that the mechanics of the syntax implicitly force us to break the narrative into blocks on the 
basis of our own intelligence (and that this mechanism is itself a safeguard against the very type of abuse under discussion) 
then we begin to appreciate the beauty and wisdom of this mechanism and to regard it as an ally.

8020. 61:6 [3], Arabic: ahmad. This is the comparative of the h-m-d root whence the name Muhammad derives, and means more 
laudable or more praiseworthy. While I do not follow this in my rendering (largely due to concerns about feeding a 
personality cult the Traditionalist has created at the expense of the Qur'anic message, but also because I am not convinced 
by the argument), the reader should know what the Traditionalist claims in this regard. Muhammad Asad summarises the 
point as well as anybody: This prediction is supported by several references in the Gospel of St. John to the Parakletos (usually 
rendered as "Comforter") who was to come after Jesus. This designation is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos ("the 
Much-Praised"), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name Mawhamana. (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic 
was the language used in Palestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in 
which the original - now lost - texts of the Gospels were composed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and 
Parakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a later scribe - confused these two expressions. It is 
significant that both the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two names of the Last 
Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from the verb hamida ("he praised") and the noun hamd ("praise"). 
An even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of the Prophet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form - is said 
to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel of St. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal, was accepted as

authentic and was read in the churches until the year 496 of the Christian era, when it was banned as "heretical" by a decree of 
Pope Geiasius. However, since the original text of that Gospel is not available (having come down to us only in an Italian 
translation dating from the late sixteenth century], its authenticity cannot be established with certainty. It is my opinion that 
the Gospel of St. Barnabas - which I have read several times - while interesting, was written within the Islamic period. It 
contains references and assumptions which identify it as a piece of - perhaps pious - Islamic extemporisation rather than an 
original scripture containing the words and deeds of‘Isa. While Muhammad Asad's comments above presuppose acceptance 
of the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis, the points he forwards are not necessarily dependent 
upon such acceptance.

this does not (and cannot) imply the acceptance of a religion created by a priestly class, but indicates rather a general act of a 
submission of the will to that of another is clear when we compare this clause with 47:35 where the same collocation (in the 
active voice) is used in the purely prosaic sense of sue for peace in a war setting; cf. 40:10 which treats of the invitation to 
faith (not to a specific ‘religion'); and see also 68:42-43 where the setting is the Day of Judgment.

8034. 61:13 [1], This clause is typically rendered out of all recognition by means of interpolations and other devices (Saheeh

central point of the chapter which is that we are not to deviate from our central calling, and that we are to be helpers of God. 
The battles, victories and gains are all very well - and God, indeed, promises to strengthen us against our enemies - but 
battles and victories are not the point; the point is that we are to stand up as witnesses to God.

8043. 61:14 [5]. I.e. as a result of the witness from Isa and those who helped him. Muhammad Asad's comments here presuppose 
acceptance of the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and provide some useful additional 
information from that perspective: [...]I.e., some of them recognized him as a prophet - and, therefore, as no more than a 
created, human being - whereas others denied this truth in the course of time by regarding him as "the son of God" - and, 
therefore, as "God incarnate" - while still others rejected him and his message altogether. The fact that the earliest followers of 
Jesus regarded him as purely human is evident from the many theological controversies which persisted during the first three or 
four centuries of the Christian era. Thus, some renowned theologians, like Theodotus of Byzantium, who lived towards the end of 
the second century, and his followers - among them Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch in the year 260 - maintained that the 
"sonship of God" mentioned in the then-existing texts of the Gospels was purely symbolic, denoting no more than that Jesus was 
a human being exalted by God. The originally widespread teachings of Bishop Arius (280-326) centred in the concept of Jesus as 
a mortal man chosen by God for a specific task, and in the concept of God as absolutely One, unknowable, and separate from 
every created being; this doctrine, however, was ultimately condemned by the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople

8065. 62:9 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty. Here the 
salat is the call for military mobilisation. 

8066. 62:9 [1], Arabic: jumu'a - assembly. This word has come to mean Friday over time, but the contrived nature of that position is 
clear when we consider the days of the week in the Arabic language in translation: we have the first day (Sunday), the second 
day (Monday), the third day (Tuesday), the fourth day (Wednesday), the fifth day (Thursday), the day of assembly (Friday), 
and the Sabbath day (Saturday). It does not require much analysis to discern the meddling hand of men. To equate Friday 
with the day of assembly is on a par with arguing that Monday ( moon-day ) is the day the moon comes out. Given the language 
in the passage (specifically 'disband' at 62:11 with its military implication, and the fact that the Jews are addressed in terms 
of their fear of death at 62:7-8) I must regard the assembly mentioned here as implying military muster: the call to arms to 
defend the community or fight in the way of God. I also see something of a parity between the opening clause of 62:11 and 
the verse at 5:24 given the reference to the Jews which precedes. 

8067. 62:9 [2], Arabic: dhikr- calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. 

8068. 62:10 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. 

8069. 62:10 [1], I.e. when the tour of duty is over; cf. 4:103.

8073. 63:1 [1], Arabic: munafiqun. Typically rendered hypocrites. See 4:138. 

8074. 63:1 [1], The Traditionalist claims that acceptance of the religion he calls Islam is achieved upon declaration of a statement 
which he calls the shahada (namely: 1 bear witness that there is no god but God and I bear witness that Muhammad is the 
messenger of God). The latter half of this popular statement is found here at 63:1 in the mouths of the waverers - who are 
directly stated by God to be liars. The Traditionalist typically bawls the entire formula from the rooftops five times a day. 
Nowhere is the Traditionalist's 'shahada' found in the Qur'an as a single statement, and nowhere is it - or anything like it - 
presented in the Qur'an as a means of accepting a religion of any sort. 

8075. 63:1 [3], Arabic: munafiqun. Typically rendered hypocrites. See 4:138. 

8076. 63:2 [1], I.e. their worldly obligations.

8081. 63:3 [3], Cf. 9:87. 

8082. 63:4 [2]. I take this as an idiom indicating treating someone overly carefully and timidly (since propped up pieces of dry 
wood can fall over in the slightest breeze). A more natural idiom in English might be to treat with kid gloves. 

8083. 63:4 [3], Arabic: sayhah. I have purposely left this as blast (as I have consistently rendered it throughout) since it allows the 
attentive reader to connect the multiple instances where this word occurs (which treat of impending or actual destruction of 
populations after rejection of their respective messengers). However, there is also a sense that such people take everything 
personally. This is also the case with those whose identity is bound up in religions - especially ones with cultural history 
attached to them. We see the language of outrage and hypersensitivity on such a basis represented in media at the present 
time as a currency of power.

8090. 63:8 [1], The Traditionalist, naturally, has constructed a narrative here from the collections of hearsay he chooses to occupy 
himself with in preference to the Qur'an. I limit myself to the Qur'an, Arabic, reputable history, and reason. 

8091. 63:8 [2]. Arabic: ‘izzah - power, prestige, honour, respect and fame.

8096. 63:9 [1], This wider point - often missed - arising from this and similar statements is that we are not to let our desire to add 
to wealth and children lead us into wrong behaviour. Many think compromising their integrity to provide better for their 
children is justified. The Qur'an exhorts us against such a course. Cf. 102:1-2.

8144. 65:4 [2]. Lit: And. 

8145. 65:4 [2], Often said by the Traditionalist - on the basis of his library of dubious fiction - to mean female children who have 
not started menstruation. To those who claim that the mood is perfect under the influence of lam (i.e. who have notyet[...]) I 
would point out that the relative pronoun and the verb are in the feminine plural and refer to (in fact, can only refer to) 
women (Arabic: nisa ') in the preceding clause. The Qur'an speaks of women as legally competent females (who can own 
property, take oaths, bear witness, swear fealty, incur punishment for their crimes). Minors can do none of those things. 
Cases of women not menstruating while not pregnant are not unusual and it is this which is referenced here. Rather than 
allowing the Traditionalist to open the door to child-sex unchallenged - and ascribe such actions to a messenger of God - it 
is time the Qur'an was allowed a voice through the consistent application of its proven values, and the later foolish and evil 
insinuations exposed on that basis.

8175. 66:5 [7], Arabic: saha. Frequently translated as oft-fasting and synonyms. This is only tenable if we take an extremely 
mystical view of the text. In one sense we are all on a journey - a pilgrimage - and are thus fasting from the comforts of our 
true home. Yet, if we are to apply such a rationale here we should apply it everywhere. I am not infected by or interested in 
that cultural virus called Feminism and am indifferent to its dogmas, I am interested only in applying a consistent reading to 
the Qur'an. And on that basis alone my view is that the case here seems to be that certain male commentators have found 
distasteful the idea that women should travel - that women should be on a journey as significant as their own - and have 
applied a sense to this word which keeps the woman in what they have seen as her place. In summary, saha properly means 
to travel, to journey, to flow and I, in common with many translators, have rendered here accordingly.

8211. 67:5 [1], Arabic: misbah, masabih. This word occurs at 24:35, 24:35, 41:12, 67:5 and is used only of stars and lamps (i.e. 
small lights). The word denoting the sun is si raj (here: torch)-, it occurs at 25:61, 33:46, 71:16, 78:13 and is used for the 
physical sun and to indicate the prophet himself (i.e. large lights - one literal and the other metaphorical). Since the Qur'an 
treats those lights which are the sun and the stars by means of different words, one assumes on that basis that the stars are 
not suns, nor is the sun a star. 

8212. 67:5 [2], Also possible is it (referring to the sky).

closing their wings. I simply do not find that in the text. I think the point being made is the contrast between birds in flight 
and when ‘clutching’ (which birds do whenever they alight). Seen outside of flight birds seldom look as if they could fly, and 
are often ungainly.

These are they for whom is the evil of punishment 
And in the hereafter are they those most in loss. (27:4-5) 

8243. 68:4 [1], Arabic: khuluq. This is often translated character, nature, way. This is not incorrect, but has been used to obfuscate 
the broader sense by those who would pour honours upon the messenger which the Qur'an denies him. khuluq occurs at just 
one other place (26:137). There it is found in the mouths of those who are indifferent to warning as something pertaining 
only to the tradition of former peoples. From this it follows that khuluq denotes an accepted code of practice, a way of doing 
things pertaining to a wider purview than that of mere personal morality or character - which is the value the Traditionalist 
ascribes to khuluq at 68:4. The case I am making is more than supported by the use of the preposition ‘aid here which, when 
used without reference to a particular verb (as here), indicates on, or upon and is used often to denote adherence to or 
standing upon (in the sense of basing one’s assumptions upon). The sense, then, is that the messenger is upon a 'tremendous 
tradition' - the tradition of all the messengers: the tradition of those who came with their warnings, were (typically) 
rejected, and whose ministries were followed by punishment from God - a pattern to which verses 68:5-6 allude.

Lane II, 724, quoting both Raghib and Taj al-’Arus).

8251. 68:25 [2], Arabic: hard. This is the only instance of this root. Non-sectarian lexicons connect the root with annoyance, anger. 
Sectarian lexicons simply state later opinions as objective facts, which is of no practical use. My sense, given such facts as we 
have and the context is that the spirit in which they left was of anticipatory dismissal of - or anger toward - any who might 
presume to enter ‘their’ garden. 

8252. 68:26 [1], My opinion is that at this point they simply do not recognise the garden and think they have lost their way. It is 
only in the next verse that they realise they have lost everything.

8271. 68:42 [1], Lit: the shank is uncovered. Arabic: shaq - shank, leg, shin. However, kashafa 'an shaq (which is the formulation 
here) is a set phrase which means to prepare oneself for difficulty or to prepare oneself for terror, and a time when a calamity 
or difficulty is uncovered (Lane p. 1471). 

8272. 68:42 [2], Arabic: s-j-d. See Article VI; as understood here the Submission [al sujud) as a noun indicates a particular reading of 
one of a number of specific portions of the Qur’an between chapter 50 and the end of chapter 114 which forms the basis of a 
nightly vigil to which outsiders are also invited to hear the message of the Qur'an. See Article XXIV. Cf. 48:29, 50:40, 68:43. 

8273. 68:42 [3], I understand these two clauses to be parenthetical in anticipation of the last clause of 68:43. As understood here 
the Submission [al sujud) as a noun indicates a particular reading of one of a number of specific portions of the Qur'an 
between chapter 50 and the end of chapter 114 which forms the basis of a nightly vigil to which outsiders are also invited to 
hear the message of the Qur’an. See Article XXIV. Cf. 48:29, 50:40, 68:43. The point being made here is that such people are 
invited to the Submission but they 'are not able’ to attend - and that there will come a time after death when they will regret 
this. This point is explicitly confirmed in the next verse. This segment itself, obviously, forms part of those sections of the 
Qur’an which comprise the Submission.

8290. 69:4 [1], The Calamity is a precise term in the Qur'an. Surely, Thamud and “Ad rejected the judgment that was to come upon 
them, but that judgment was a function of their denial of the Calamity from which no man can escape. See 101:3.

variously - and very contradictorily - explained by the early commentators. Ibn Abbas, when asked about it, frankly answered, "I 
do not know what ghisiin denotes" [Razi][...] Such reasonable honesty is refreshing - would that the Muslims had continued 
thus. I also do not know what ghisiin means and leave the word untranslated. If you are able to furnish objective 
etymological evidence, please let me know.

possessed of knowledge originating outside the Qur'anic revelation.

for definitions. Related meanings refer to relationship (between family or tribe) and sorts or types of men who assert 
connection to one another, other meanings relate to dispersal (i.e. groups dispersed). I think it is the connection between 
them rather than the fact of their dispersal which is the salient point here, and have made a decision on that basis. If you can 
supply genuine historical or etymological data on this point, please let me know. I came to my view independently of 
Muhammad Asad, who happened to come to a similar conclusion. His comments here (with light editing) are as follows: This, 
again, connects with the statement in verse 19[...] People who do not want to see the truth of God's existence and have, 
therefore, no solid basis on which to build their world-view, are, by the same token, unable to conceive any definite standards of 
personal and social ethics. Hence, whenever they are confronted with anyone's positive assertion of faith, they "run about to and 
fro" in spiritual confusion, trying, in order to justify themselves intellectually, to demolish the premises of that faith by means of 
many-sided, contradictory arguments - an endeavour depicted in the metaphor, "coming upon thee from the right and from the 
left"; and since they derive all their strength from a conformity with shallow mass-opinions, they can do this only "in crowds".

8359. 71:27 [1], Grammar: licentious ingrates is generally (and not incorrectly) rendered as the object of beget. However, it can also 

be read as I have rendered (i.e. denoting instrumentality) and I think the case is stronger for this reading given that it is an 
established Qur'anic principle that each man is responsible for himself. Thus, it is the complete disintegration of morals and 
disconnection of sex from righteousness found among the Atlanteans which Nuh is referencing - a condition mirrored today. 
Cf. the words attributed to Jesus at Matt. 24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, 
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark[...].

8366. 72:1 [1], Arabic: wahi and awha. See 3:44. Lit.: it is instructed to me. 

8367. 72:1 [2], Many chapters have defining characteristics. Here that characteristic is annahu or that (it). The verse at 72:1 
concerns what the messenger is instructed (or given by inspiration) and all translators render along these lines at that 
juncture. All I have done is enforce consistency to this convention throughout the chapter. (It is certainly true that the word 
rendered here that is acceptably elided by translators - and I do so myself - in some other contexts. But the fact of its 
repeated incidence in this chapter requires - to my mind at least - that it be regarded as an active and operative element.) 
Most Traditionalists consider the majority of the chapter to refer to jinn. That is not my understanding since applying a 
systematic translation methodology to it. My reading is that it consists of a series of statements given to the messenger of 
which information regarding the jinn forms the first part only, and that the aggregate of these statements is put in right 
perspective vis-a-vis the prophetic mission of Muhammad beginning 72:20. I include footnotes throughout to show how, 
where and why the reading here has a bias different to that preferred by the Traditionalist. 

8368. 72:1 [3], Arabic: nafar: men (as a collective): band, party, troop.

We 8387 reached for the sky 


8380. 72:6 [2]. I.e. aid, assistance and all manner of good - that which one rightly seeks with God. 

8381. 72:6 [3], I.e. the men among jinn increased them (i.e. those among human men who seek their protection) in baseness; this 

verse touches upon the mechanics behind what those who worship other than God alone experience and why they 
experience it. 

8382. 72:6 [3], Arabic: rahaq. The Arabic senses cover: doing of forbidden things, wrongdoing; urging to that which one is not able to 
do; haste in deportment or disposition; ignorance; ill-nature, evil disposition; suspicion, evil opinion; lowness, vileness, 
meanness; weakness (Lane p. 1777). This puts me in mind of the type of events outlined in, for example, the Book of Enoch 
wherein fallen angels instruct men in various debasing arts. 

8383. 72:7 [1], This is further instruction given to the messenger. See note to 72:1. 

8384. 72:7 [2], I take this to indicate those who appealed to jinn for benefits. 

8385. 72:7 [2], I.e. those the messenger is addressing. 

8386. 72:8 [1], This is further instruction given to the messenger. See note to 72:1. 

8387. 72:8 [2], As Traditionally read, the current subject is jinn. As read here, the subject is the we or us of 72:4-5 - i.e. human 

beings. Muhammad Asad (whose own process of investigation was not much dissimilar to mine on this point) feels that in 
the first instance this refers to the Jewish people, but also humanity at large and: [...jmay be understood as alluding not only, 
metaphorically, to the arrogant Jewish belief in their being "God's chosen people", but also, more factually, to their old 
inclination to, and practice of, astrology as a means to foretell the future. Apart from this - and in a more general sense - their 
"reaching out towards heaven" may be a metaphorical description of a state of mind which causes man to regard himself as 
"self-sufficient" and to delude himself into thinking that he is bound to achieve mastery over his own fate. I cannot say that 
there is enough evidence to regard this understanding as more than an interesting perspective; this verse and the one 
following certainly reference a time when men reached for the stars - be it metaphorically, philosophically, spiritually or 
physically. My personal inclination is that the reference here and at 72:9 relate to humankind’s gathering before God prior to 
this life (see 7:172), but God knows best.

that God communicates with men only via approved messengers (so, unless you are an approved messenger, you are 
speaking out of vain desire). It is clear from other statements that the messenger himself had no knowledge of the Hour (for 
example 33:63, 46:9).

8430. 73:5 [1], Arabic: qawl - speech; teaching, doctrine; saying, word. 

8431. 73:6 [2], Arabic: wat’ - low, smooth land between eminences. The allusion here is to an easily traversed stretch of land 
between the ‘mountains' of this day and the next. The verb also carries sense of treading. Implicit in the imagery is the idea 
that one can more easily cover spiritual distance at night. 

8432. 73:6 [3], Night is best suited to spiritual reflection and contemplation of ultimate reality. 

8433. 73:7 [1], Arabic: tawil - long; large, tall; high. The rendering has been adapted to the requirements of the noun. 

8434. 73:7 [1], The Arabic noun here ( sabh ) is related to the form I verb sabaha. Lane gives both to swim and to travel far and other 
concepts of movement among the primary meanings for the verb (Lane p. 1299); I have been guided by this since it 
continues the image from 73:6. The sense is of a busy man crossing the rocky hills of mundane life during the day but at 
night entering the flat, wide expanse of the plain at the end of which the rocky hill of the day ahead stands. 

8435. 73:8 [2], Arabic: tabattala. This form V verb means: to retire from the world, to devote one’s life to God or to apply oneself to 
his service, to be pious, self-denying; to live in chastity. This is the only instance of this form, and the only two instances of this 
root occur in this verse. 

8436. 73:8 [2], Arabic: tabtil - devotion. This is the form II noun, although it clearly has much in common with the form V verb 
described above. Lit.: devote thyself to him with devotion.

8456. 74:14 [1], Arabic: mahhada - as well as senses connected to smoothing, levelling, and making easy, means to smooth out (a 
bed) or make ready (such as a cradle or cot). 

8457. 74:16 [1], The subject of this chapter is the complaisant, comfortable man who rejects warning. His assumptions are 
countered here by kalla [No, indeed!). A number of chapters make use of what one might call defining mechanisms (i.e. 
particular word combinations or features which dominate in the chapter in which they occur). In this case, the defining 
mechanism or characteristic is kalla. It occurs four times in a staccato-like sequence throughout the chapter (thus drawing 
attention to itself), occurring twice at the very end of the chapter, after which we are told that it is a reminder (a formula 
which repeats at 80:11). My investigations show kalla to have a secondary function as a marker (or reminder) by means of 
which the attentive reader is directed to all other instances where kalla occurs - and that all these instances complement 
each other and are beneficial when read together. The central point of the set is here at 74:16 since this provides the most 
extensive treatment of the archetype with which the entire set deals, and does so within the dominant topic of the chapter. 
Thus, the student of the Qur'an finds he is given a single and extensive argument which comprehensively treats of one of his 
dominant concerns when he draws the text together by means of these easily identified coordinates. The complete set is 
found at 19:79, 19:82, 23:100, 34:27, 70:15, 70:39, 74:16, 74:32, 74:53, 74:54, 75:11, 75:20, 75:26, 78:4, 78:5, 80:11, 80:23,

31. (And we made the companions of the fire only

8463. 74:26 [1], Qur’anic definition: saqcir - that which spares not, leaves not and makes visible (the truth) to human beings 
[74:28-29). 

8464. 74:27 [1], See 74:26. 

8465. 74:29 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: Most of the commentators interpret the above elliptic phrase in the sense of 
"changing the appearance of man" or "scorching the skin of man". The rendering adopted by me, on the other hand, is based on 
the primary significance of the verb laha - "it appeared", "it shone forth" or "it became visible". Hence, the primary meaning of 
the intensive participial noun lawwah is "that which makes [something] visible". In the above context, it relates to the sinner’s 
belated cognition of the truth, as well as to his distressing insight into his own nature, his past failings and deliberate 
wrongdoings, and the realization of his own responsibility for the suffering that is now in store for him: a state neither of life nor 
of death, (cf. 87:12-13). 

8466. 74:30 [1], Or Over. See notes on the companions of the fire below; in a literal sense, all remaining 19 instances of this key 
phrase are above (or over ) it - i.e. saqar - given that the instance of the companions of the fire which follows is the last in the 
set. 

8467. 74:30 [1], Typically understood - not without justification given the context - to be the number of those entrusted with the 
management of saqar, although I disagree with that assessment (for more, see notes immediately above and below). Much is 
made by some of the number 19 based on the work of Rashad Khalifa about whose work (and later developments based 
thereon) there is no scarcity of information online. 

8468. 74:31 [1], I.e. indestructible. The final word of this clause can be read angels or as angels. If read the first way, the implication 
is that the companions of the fire mentioned here are themselves angels. While this is the popular reading, the Qur'anic 
evidence is against it. The expression the companions of the fire occurs a total of 20 times (2:39, 2:81, 2:217, 2:257, 2:275, 
3:116, 5:29, 7:36, 7:44, 7:47, 7:50, 10:27, 13:5, 39:8, 40:6, 40:43, 58:17, 59:20, 64:10, 74:31) and in all cases outside of the 
one under discussion at 74:31 it unquestionably references those who are to suffer in Hell. In the absence of explicit, 
incontrovertible evidence to the contrary, a reasonable man must assume that what is meant in each of the remaining 19 
instances is what is meant here also; this simple process of analysis also, incidentally, provides us with a reasonable answer 
to what is referenced by the number 19 here (which itself has served as the catalyst for so much generative and speculative 
output of a mathematical nature beginning with Rashad Khalifa) - i.e. all the other cases of the companions of the fire; thus, 
the cardinal number found above at 74:30 merely indicates the number of the remaining cases of the companions of the fire 
all of which precede this one in the text, and acts as a parity bit by means of which we receive a proof point supportive of the 
Qur’an's claim to be complete, preserved and in the correct order - something which Rashid Khalifa in part, in effect, was 
compelled to dispute in order to attempt to bend the facts to his theories.

And that those in whose hearts is disease and 
those who spurn guidance while claiming 
virtue 8481 might say: What means God by this 
example? 8482 


8469. 74:31 [2]. I take their to refer in the first instance to those who are indifferent to warning since an archetype of this category 
has occupied the majority of the narrative hitherto and is identified by name in this clause. However, a careful reading 
indicates that the force of their number extends to the additional categories of person which follow. Unlike the Khalifa 
interpretation (which considers that their relates to angels in the previous verse and proceeds to make much hay on that 
basis), my attention is on the broader narrative of the chapter; my instinct is always to fight shy of ascribing ambiguous 
statements highly specific values. 

8470. 74:31 [2]. The Arabic ‘idda is used both to denote a cardinal number and a number of days (count of time) throughout and so 
it is understandable that one might take it in the first sense, especially coming so close to mention of a cardinal number. 
However, if we regard the chapter as a whole, the broader narrative treats of human beings (and not angels which is what 
the both the Traditionalist and Rashad Khalifa claim is being referenced in this clause) and therefore the stronger case is that 
the reference here is either to the number of human beings or to the number of days they live. Given what follows, the 
second of these two options is the one convincing to me. We each have a number of days to live, the core point of which is 
that we should declare our hand vis-a-vis God. However, since we do not know how long we shall live, this fact allows those 
who reject to feel no great urgency about their heedlessness towards God - which serves as the cause of their denial. That 
same span of time allows the men who heed God’s warning to respond in their respective ways also. Cf. 19:84.

are to deal with the words on the page, the sense surely is: 75:16: Move thou not thy tongue with it to hasten it (it being the 
Day of Resurrection which has been the dominant subject of the chapter to this point) - that is: do not claim it to be coming

8555. 77:30 [1], Lit.: shadow of three branches or off-shoots. After considering the lexicons, the context, and looking at a number of 
existing translations I agreed with Muhammad Asad's rendering of the close of this statement, whose lead I have followed. 
Asad's comment here reads: he., of death, resurrection and God's judgment, all three of which cast dark shadows, as it were, 
over the sinners' hearts. 

8556. 77:33 [1], Since being guided by Muhammad Asad at 7:40,1 take his point here as well. While I do not admit Bukhari et alas 
authorities of any kind, in the interests of full disclosure I repeat Asad's note here in its entirety (with non-essential 
information only removed): Lit., "like yellow twisted ropes", yellow being "the colour of fire" (Baghawi). The conventional 
rendering of jimalat (also spelt jimalat and jimalah) as "camels", adopted by many commentators and, until now, by all 
translators of the Qur'an, must be rejected as grossly anomalous; see[...j the second part of 7:40 - "they shall not enter paradise 
any more than a twisted rope can pass through a needle’s eye". In the above verse, too, the plural noun jimalah (or jimalat) 
signifies "twisted ropes" or "giant ropes" - a connotation that has been forcefully stressed by lbn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa’id ibn 
Jubayr and others (cf. Tabari, Baghawi, Razi, lbn Kathir; also Bukhari, Kitab at-Tafsir). Moreover, our observation of the 
trajectory of shooting stars fully justifies the rendering "giant fiery ropes". Similarly, my rendering ofqasr, in this context, as 
"[burning] logs" - instead of the conventional (and utterly meaningless) "castles", "palaces", etc. - goes back to all of the above- 
mentioned authorities.

8563. 78:3 [1], Sc. is empty foolishness (because they repudiated God's proofs out of hand; cf. 78:28). I parse the text differently 
than is common because I think the point being made is other than that usually assumed. Saheeh International, for example, 
renders 78:1-4 About what are they asking one another? About the great news. That over which they are in disagreement. No! 
They are going to know. The problem is that the general point is not clear and kalla [No, indeed!) has nothing to negate or to 
express surprise at - which is its function. I believe there is a rhetorical point here which follows thematically from the 
previous chapter which is: About what do they question one another? Is it about the tremendous report (i.e. of the Day of 
Judgment)? No, indeed (i.e. they are questioning one another about something else)/ (Cf. 38:67-68, 38:88.) The argument 
then proceeds: They will come to know (i.e. nevertheless, despite the fact that they ignore it).

8567. 78:11 [1], Arabic: ma'ash. This word occurs only once. It conveys the sense of life, manner (or style ) of living; livelihood, 
subsistence, living: means of subsistence; income (Wehr, p. 775). Lane (p. 2262) includes senses such as that by which one lives 
and time wherein one seeks sustenance. Muhammad Asad comments: According to Zamakhshari, the term ma'ash ("that 
whereby one lives") is here synonymous with "life". In the polarity of sleep (or "death") and wakefulness (or "life") we see the 
allusion to bodily death and subsequent resurrection already touched upon in 6:60. On the basis of this, I take ma'ash to 
indicate here what we mean by a living in English in the expression to earn a living.

considerable academic and contemplative talents. While I am temperamentally inclined to agree with him on this point, in 
the event I cannot. The reading I have followed (which is the commonest one - from which Asad explains his divergence), is 
not only in full agreement with the best lexicons (which, of course, do not take precedence over the Qur'an's own definitions, 
nor are to be trusted blindly) but also confirmed by my full analysis (see Article XXII). I would add that while the Qur'an 
directs itself principally to men as head of tribes and families, women are of equal value and their efforts are equally 
rewarded - points which the Qur'an makes clearly. That being the case, when dealing with such metaphorical and highly 
symbolic parts of the text as this, one naturally extrapolates equivalent pleasures and rewards for women. I make this point

not because I am infected with that current social virus called political correctness, but because it is objectively the case. As a 
translator and interpreter and believer, I bear a responsibility for the words as they appear on the page, and it is with 
cognisance of that responsibility that I have both rendered as I have in this instance and felt moved to include the relevant 
part of Muhammad Asad's comment for the edification and broader perspective of the interested reader: [,..]it is to be 
remembered that the term ka'b - from which the participle ka’ib is derived - has many meanings, and that one of these meanings 
is "prominence'', "eminence" or "glory" (Lisan al-Arab); thus, the verb ka’ba, when applied to a person, signifies "he made 
[another person] prominent", "glorious" or "splendid" [ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb ka'ba and the noun 
ka’b, the participle ka'ib has often been used, in popular parlance, to denote "a girl whose breasts are becoming prominent" or 
"are budding" hence, many commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of youthful "female companions' who would 
entertain the (presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apart from the fact that all Quranic allegories of the joys of 
paradise invariably apply to men and women alike, this interpretation ofkawa’ib overlooks the purely derivative origin of the 
above popular usage - which is based on the tropical connotation of "prominence" inherent in the noun ka'b - and substitutes for 
this obvious tropism the literal meaning of something that is physically prominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly unjustified. 
If we bear in mind that the Quranic descriptions of the blessings of paradise are always allegorical, we realize that in the above 
context the term kawa'ib can have no other meaning than "glorious [or "splendid"] beings", without any definition of sex; and 
that, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes, "splendid companions well matched" - thus alluding to the relations of the 
blest with one another, and stressing the absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of all of them]..].

8592. 79:10 [1], Arabic: hafira - this word is originally connected with concepts related to digging, making holes in the earth, 
thence to those of tracks (i.e. those left by cattle and horses) and from there to: the way by which one comes. Only in more 
rarified extractions does it have the connotation translators often give it of original state. I have rendered here using the

related connotations.

earth - and some translators render accordingly. It is said to have this meaning due to the distance an Arab could traverse in 
a night. However, I am wary of these attributions and render according to the primary sense.

assertions about the shape of the earth. What is true is that there exists in Arabic the word udhiya (ostrich nest) which is 
based on the same root; however, this word derives from the fact that the female ostrich has no nest in the traditional sense, 
but rather spreads out and flattens a place on the ground where she lays her eggs.

increase in wealth. The salient point is of worldly interests faded to nothing.

8622. 81:8 [1], Societies have repeatedly practiced the killing of children to curry favour with the gods. The Greeks practiced 
exposure: the Arabs practiced the killing of female infants. Today, unborn children are sacrificed in their millions on the 
altars of materialism, narcissism and selfishness. The object is always the same no matter the cult: to improve one's lot. 

8623. 81:9 [1], Arabic: dhanb. See Article XHI.iv. 

8624. 81:16 [1], Arabic: jawar. This word has been consistently rendered as ships (lit.: those flowing ) throughout, a decision 
supported not only etymologically but contextually. While some translators choose to abandon that value here, I stay with it. 
I agree with the translators and others who say the reference is to stars. However, I believe the metaphor is twofold: that of 
ships passing over the horizon and that of stars traversing the sky and entering a hidden (safe) place. 

8625. 81:16 [1], The Arabic kunnas denotes something returning to - or hiding in - its place of origin, such as a fox to its covet.

8689. 85:4 [1], Also: destroyed, killed. 

8690. 85:4 [1], The Traditionalist has some stories which he connects with these verses to derive particular meanings. I ignore 
them on the basis that whatever lessons we need to take from the Qur’an are found within it. Muhammad Asad here, as so 
often, provides an oasis of sanity and sense: Lit., "those responsible (ashab) for the pit of fire abounding in fuel". In order to 
explain this parabolic passage, the commentators interpret it - quite unnecessarily - in the past tense, and advance the most 
contradictory legends meant to "identify" those evildoers in historical terms. The result is a medley of stories ranging from 
Abraham's experiences with his idolatrous contemporaries (cf. 21:68-70) to the Biblical legend of Nebuchadnezzar's attempt to 
burn three pious Israelites in a fiery furnace (The Book of Daniel iii, 19 ff), or the persecution, in the sixth century, of the 
Christians of Najran by the King of Yemen, Dhu Nawas (who was a Jew by religion), or the entirely apocryphal story of a 
Zoroastrian king who burnt to death those of his subjects who refused to accept his dictum that a marriage of brother and sister 
was "permitted by God"; and so forth. None of these legends needs, of course, to be seriously considered in this context. As a 
matter of fact, the very anonymity of the evildoers referred to in the above Qur'anic passage shows that we have here a parable 
and not an allusion to "historical" or even legendary events. The persecutors are people who, having no faith whatsoever, hate 
to see faith in others (see verse 8 below); the "pit of fire" is a metaphor for the persecution of the latter by the former: a 
phenomenon not restricted to any particular time or to a particular people but recurring in many forms and in varying degrees 
of intensity throughout recorded history.

root with turab (dust) from which man is made (3:59). I stand by the rendering I have used because this definition is found 
in the least sectarian sources. While I have not been guided by nor fully agree with Muhammad Asad's comment at this 
point, I add it for interest: The plural noun tara'ib, rendered by me as "pelvic arch", has also the meaning of "ribs" or "arch of 
bones"; according to most of the authorities who have specialized in the etymology of rare Quranic expressions this term relates 
specifically to female anatomy (Taj al-'Arus).

8714. 87:7 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The classical commentators assume that the above words are addressed 
specifically to the Prophet, and that, therefore, they relate to his being taught the Qur'an and being promised that he would not 
forget anything thereof, "save what God may will [thee to forget]". This last clause has ever since given much trouble to the 
commentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible that He who has revealed the Qur'an to the Prophet should cause him to 
forget anything of it. Hence, many unconvincing explanations have been advanced from very early times down to our own days, 
the least convincing being that last refuge of every perplexed QuP an-commentator, the "doctrine of abrogation". However, the 
supposed difficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as we allow ourselves to realize that the above passage, though 
ostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at man in general]..]. My own view is that the case is simpler: the classical 
commentators have not understood the Qur'an's use of implicit punctuation (i.e. how certain portions of the text cry out that 
they are asides and should be regarded as parenthetical): thus, this clause relates to the climax of 87:2-5 above; the outline 
of stages of growth such as we see at 87:2-5 is quite a common one (cf. 22:5, 23:14-15, 40:67) and the implication in such 
cases is that the continuance or completion of such growth or progression is contingent upon the will of God - a point which 
is stated explicitly here. The clause in parenthesis at 87:6 is merely a precursor to the only place in the Qur'an where the 
prophet is told personally (i.e. in the second person singular imperative) to recite (Arabic root: q-r-") - which occurs in 
chapter 96. This is another nail in the coffin of the Traditionalist's stock of fictions which holds that the ninety-sixth chapter 
was the first revelation Muhammad received; on the basis of the internal Qur'anic evidence that view is simply 
unsustainable. The instance of the form IV of the same verb which means to make recite and is found here at 87:6 is the only 
one in the text.

We have made their works fair to them so they wander blindly. 

These are they for whom is the evil of punishment 
And in the hereafter are they those most in loss. (27:4-5) 

8728. 89:1 [1], I take this to refer to the dawn which opens upon those peoples who rejected God and his messengers and were 
destroyed (see below). 

8729. 89:2 [1], The Traditionalist has some stories he prefers here rather than to apply himself to the Qur'an. I am not interested in 
his stories and limit myself to the Qur'an, Arabic, real history, and the use of reason. This oath presented at 89:5 is a 
challenge to think - one which clearly indicates for whom it is intended; so let us presume to apply intelligence. This form 
(i.e. the plural form of night: layaT) occurs only four times (19:10, 34:18, 69:7 and here at 89:2). At 19:10 it says ‘Thy proof is 
that thou shalt not speak to men three nights being sound'. At 69:7 it says: ‘Which he made serviceable against them for seven 
nightsf..]’. If we take the three nights of 19:10 and the seven nights of 69:7 we have the ten nights of 89:2. The verse at 34:18 
has no mention of number and simply states nights, and itself serves to connect this part of the riddle with the next (see note 
on travel by night to 89:4 below). 

8730. 89:4 [1], Or it, however I think he is what is meant. See the note below on travel by night. 

8731. 89:4 [1], This form I verb means to travel by night or depart by night. The instances where travelling or departing at night are 
portrayed in the Qur'an by means of this verb in this form all treat of destruction for the rejecters: 11:81, 15:65 (Lut leaving 
his city prior to destruction), 20:77, 26:52, 44:23 (Musa crossing water prior to the destruction of Fir'awn), and 34:18 (the 
people of Saba' allowed the chance to travel by day and night prior to their destruction). Thus, there are total of six instances 
(even number) treating of a total of three scenarios (odd number).The narrative then picks up at 89:5-13 with reminders of 
those whom God destroyed.

Guardians and trustees for the inheritance of minors or women or persons unable to look after their own interests should fulfil 
their trusts with even more care than they devote to their own interests. Instead of that they selfishly "devour" the property. (2) 
Persons who inherit property in their own rights should remember that in that case, too, it is a sacred trust. They must use it for 
the purposes, objects, and duties which they also inherit. It gives them no licence to live in idleness or waste their days in riotous 
show. Cf. 4:8.

to claim the correct nuance here with a high level of confidence. With Muhammad Asad I feel that bury best suits the context, 
my own reasons for choosing bury being that it is related to the concept of kufr (to deny, to hide, to cover over) and in 
consideration of the levelling of the earth which follows at 91:14; nevertheless, I do not claim a definitive view here.

8757. 91:14 [2], Muhammad Asad comments here: The verb ‘aqara primarily denotes "he hamstrung [an animal]"- i.e., before 
slaughtering it, so that it might not run away. This barbarous custom was widely practiced in pre-lslamic Arabia, so that ‘aqr 
["hamstringing") gradually became synonymous with slaughtering in a cruel manner (Razi; see also Lane V, 2107 f).

The Qur'an is clear: the recipient of the Qur'an was astray and then guided (cf. 26:20). Guidance comes from God. It is not 
complicated to grasp once one gets past tribalism, non-Qur'anic invented stories and man-worship shoehorned into the

word: sinin [n. occurring once in the Qur’an] the commentators differ as to the origin and meaning of this word. The majority 
consider it a modification ofsayna’ (q.v.) [Sinai] but some others regard it as a borrowing from Ethiopic meaning splendour. 
Others derive it from the Arabic root s-n-w meaning splendour or blessings, while others regard it as a plural of siniyyatun, a 
type of tree. This is a question concerning which the Arabia Felix thesis merits further investigation. See Article XVIII. 

8785. 95:3 [1], Assumed by the Traditionalist to refer to Makkah. The Petra thesis - or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis - points 
to the fact that Petra was a city of sanctuary. The Arabia Felix thesis makes an alternative claim here. Makkah is 
unsustainable as a value since it cannot be shown to have existed as a fortified or dominant location at the time in question.

Those who believe notin the hereafter 

We have made their works fair to them so they wander blindly. 

These are they for whom is the evil of punishment 
And in the hereafter are they those most in loss. (27:4-5) 

8805. 97:1 [1], There is much to unpack in this chapter. The first question here is: what is sent down? The Traditionalist asserts 
that the pronoun object refers to revelation, his view being confirmed as the correct one (albeit for reasons other than those 
he typically offers) by a review of all instances where the formulation "we sent it down" occurs outside the present context 
(6:92, 6:155, 10:24, 12:2, 13:37, 14:1, 17:105, 18:45, 20:113, 21:50, 22:16, 38:29, 44:3) - each of which deals either directly 
with revelation or, in a small minority of cases, with water - itself an obvious symbol for God's word. In treating the 
Traditionalist's existing presentation, we must address 44:3-4 where some see a foreshadowing of, or reference to, what we 
have here at chapter 97, namely, layla al qadr - the value of which they assume to be the night of divine decree, an 
assumption based entirely on sources other than the Qur'an (for more on which see notes below). Verses 44:3-4 read: "We 
sent it down on a blessed night, (We are warning), Wherein every wise command is distinguished the context there 
indisputably treats of revelation (cf. By the clear law! at 44:2) and, accordingly, it is that (i.e. that law, book or revelation) 
which is the object sent down at the beginning of chapter 44; moreover, we agree with the Traditionalist that it is only 
reasonable that the same is the case here at chapter 97: that which is referenced by means of "it" is, likewise, revelation. 
However, at chapter 44, the Traditionalist likes to concentrate on the sending down of the revelation to Muhammad as a 
special, private event focused on Muhammad the prophet, and he leverages and extends this assumption in order to inform 
the sense one is to derive under his guidance here at chapter 97 - and it is this aspect of this topic we now wish to address. 
To the extent that the revelation of God reaches those men who are not prophets, God "sent it down" to them also (albeit in a 
general and more diffused sense - a sense which the Traditionalist also accepts where it suits him) and it must be this 
broader, more general sense which is implied in 44:3-4 since the following context (in fact, the entire chapter) treats of 
warning - that is: the emphasis throughout is not on the private receipt of revelation from God by the prophet, but on the 
delivery of that revelation to the people; and if we are to claim a correlation between 44:3-4 and chapter 97 - as the 
Traditionalist does - on the strength of the similarities in their references to God sending down revelation on a particular 
night (and I certainly accept that correlation) then we should insist upon equivalence between the two segments: if receipt 
of revelation (whether heeded or not) by the generality of men (rather than an initial, private receipt by the prophet) be 
accepted as operative in the first case, it should be accepted in like manner in the second case. 

8806. 97:1 [1], The etymological options available to the Arabic qadr (often rendered here divine decree ) may be gathered into five 
general groupings, here separated by semi-colons: extent, scope, quantity, amount, scale, rate, measure, number; sum, amount: 
degree, grade; worth, standing, value, rank; divine decree. My opinion is that the sense of divine decree is a lexical 
development originating in another place. Be that as it may, it is certainly the case that such a value for qadr occurs nowhere 
outside of the present chapter, even according to the Traditionalist's own assessment. According to the methodology applied 
in the present work, in order to find which of the remaining semantic groupings is referenced here, we should look to all 
remaining instances of qadr in the text (6:91, 22:74, 39:67, 65:3). We find that at 6:91, 22:74 and 39:67 qadr means measure 
in the sense of appraisal or estimation ("and they measure not God with the measure due him...". In the sole remaining case 
outside the present chapter the context is also that of extent or measure (the limits of God at 65:1, and [waiting] term at 
65:2.). Thus in all cases outside the present chapter, measure or extent is either the explicit sense, the dominant context, or 
both. I must, therefore, assume it to be the sense here also. Since at 6:91, 22:74 and 39:67 the connotation of measure 
implied is that of appraisal or determination (in the sense of evaluation ), this is the value I identify and use here. The 
question remains as to who the active agent is in the determination on such a night: God or man? The Traditionalist assumes

the former (e.g. that it is God who is referenced here; who is seen establishing his decree on this special night over all affairs 
for the coming year). However, this is an assumption, and one for which one can point to no explicit Qur'anic support. The 
only other place at which the construction night + definite article + noun occurs in the Qur'anic text is at 2:187 ["On the night 
of the fast")-, the active agents - i.e. the doers of the noun value - in that case are men (for it is not God who fasts but men). If 
we are interested in consistency - and the Qur'an cites consistency in support of its claim to originate with God - we should 
incline to the view that the operation of "al qadr" here pertains, likewise, primarily to men rather than to God (although, 
naturally, in both cases - that of determination as here and of fasting as at 2:187 - God is the instigator, witness, and ultimate 
rewarder). The above points accepted, the import of this collocation is that God sent down the Qur'an on the night on which 
men are - or were - to make a determination, evaluation or assessment; but a determination, evaluation or assessment of 
what? The key to this question is grasped by understanding the full sense of the word saldm as found at 97:5 (for which see 
notes thereto) as well as the points covered in the remainder of the notes to this chapter. However, in summary: the believers 
are to form a determination of the hearers (whether they be friends, believers, rejecters, ignorant ones, etc.) based upon the 
hearers' own determination of that portion of the Qur'an recited to them by the believers. Additional contextual and 
linguistic support for the points found in this note will be gained by reading 74:18-25. 

8807. 97:2 [1], The formulation here is telling. The convention "And what will convey to thee...?" always indicates something which 
Muhammad is not expected to understand, and for which there follows an explanation (69:3, 74:27, 77:14, 82:17, 82:18, 
83:8, 83:19, 86:2, 90:12, 97:2, 101:3, 101:10, 104:5). Such is the case here; thus, at 97:2 the Qur'an presents an Muhammad 
ignorant of the meaning of layla al qadr - a point which contrasts starkly with the hadith literature, which ascribes to 
Muhammad here - as so often - knowledge the Qur'an denies him. The hadith literature has Muslims looking for a special 
night in the hopes of gaining some uncommon access to God who, on the correct night - so it is claimed - determines all 
affairs for the year ahead. Such exegesis supplies superficial but unfounded Qur'anic support to those who are 
temperamentally inclined to abdicate personal responsibility so to do; to refuse to correlate the results of their lives with 
their own actions; and to look for benefit to particular times - instead of to the observation of the extant and operative laws 
of God - which practice is properly regarded as a form of polytheism. 

8808. 97:3 [1], Arabic: shahr - moon, month. A thousand moons is equal to just over 83 solar years - a long life by any reckoning. 
Thus "the night of the determination" is better than a long life - and as the second clause of 97:4 shows - no matter how 
spent. 

8809. 97:4 [1], Having properly understood and parsed the rest of the chapter the present clause falls naturally into a nested 
parenthetical statement; thus, on "the night of the determination" it is "by the leave of their lord" (i.e. by the leave of the lord 
of those who make the determination or, possibly, the lord of the angels and the Spirit themselves) that the angels and the 
Spirit descend - and not because one happened rightly to guess at and observe a particular night, one whose expectation is 
drawn from an entirely different literature and whose characteristics require (in order for such a phenomenon to seem to be 
discerned within the Qur'an) the mangling of Arabic usage in the local context out of all alignment with those senses 
established throughout the corpus (for more see notes below). 

8810. 97:4 [2], Arabic: min kulli. See 2:164. 

8811. 97:4 [2], The translators render min kulli here as [,..]on every (errand) or [,..]with each (decree). Nowhere in the remaining 44 
instances of min kulli in the Qur'an do we find anything close to such a value. The task in hand is not to try to bend the 
Qur’an to what one’s favourite school of Islam’ has constructed on the basis of the hadith, but to seek coherence and sense 
within the integrity of the Qur'an's own fabric. On such a basis, min kulli can only mean every sort of, of every, among every or 
from (among) every. And ‘amr means command, matter or affair. By treating the phrase above as a nested statement (see

note thereto) and min kulli in accordance with its commonest pan-textual value (for more see note at 2:164) the sense 
becomes The night of the determination is better than a thousand moonsf.] of every sort of affair - the import of the second 
part of this statement being no matter how lived or of any type whatsoever. 

8812. 97:5 [1], Arabic: saldm - soundness, well-being; peace, peacefulness; safety, security. Contextual comparison of all instances of 
salam as found in this context (i.e. without following modifiers such as be unto you') outside the present one (10:10, 11:69, 
11:69, 14:23, 15:52, 33:44, 36:58, 43:89, 51:25, 51;25, 56:26, 56:26, 56:91) reveals this convention to possess the following 
applications: 1. as a general greeting (for persons either known or not known); 2. as a means of respectfully extricating 
oneself from interaction with those who are either ignorant or who reject faith; 3. God's greeting to the believers 
(specifically, upon their being received into the joys of the fuller life). The first two applications are fully consonant with the 
present context as understood and expounded upon here, and the third is aptly and beautifully prefigured (see also note 
below). 

8813. 97:5 [2], Grammar: feminine pronoun agreeing with night. Based on the totality of my investigations - the results of which 
comprise this translation and the notes thereto - the collocation "the night of the determination" is a function of what is 
identified in the broader work as "the Submission" (Arabic: al sujud), i.e. that night vigil to which others are invited to hear 
the world of God (see Article XXIV; cf. 48:29, 50:40, 68:42, 68:43) the chapters for which comprise a subset of the Qur'an 
(and of which subset the present chapter forms part of the closing section); on "the night of the determination" men make 
their determinations: some among those outside the fold of believers accept, and others reject; meanwhile, believers 
themselves make their determinations of those to whom the words of God have been recited, whether they be believers, 
rejecters, friends or ones lost in ignorance. Understood as presented here and expounded in the supporting notes, this 
chapter forms an entirely natural precursor to the next.

7:172). 

8827. 98:5 [5], Arabic: ata al zakat. Claimed by the Traditionalist to reference an obligatory tax, the collocation ata al zakat is 
shown in this work to mean to give (what is conducive to) - or to pay (the price of) - (sexual) purity (i.e. to abjure social

8860. 103:1 [1], Arabic: ‘asr. Often translated as time or afternoon, these renderings - while not exactly incorrect - miss a crucial 
point. A wider acquaintance with Arabic reveals that ‘asr is used for age (as in Ice Age, Bronze Age, etc.), and epoch, and 
period. That is, ‘asr denotes a span of time, time with a beginning and an end. Both time and afternoon have some connection 
with this most important point rattling about in them somewhere, but to render bluntly thus in English excludes the reader 
from the core point. The salient sense here is the span of time (i.e. a period with a beginning and an end) not simply time as 
an open-ended concept or as something which happens after lunch.

8869. 105:1 [1], Lit.: the companions of. This expression is often used to mean those belonging to or those living in or those forming 
part of or those possessing (a particular quality). 

8870. 105:1 [1], Arabic: fit. The Traditionalist has some fanciful ideas about this chapter whose origins have no Qur’anic basis and 
which posit that fil here means elephant. It is true that one of the meanings of fil is elephant. However,/?/ also means base, 
weak-, weak in judgment. For those interested in the Qur'an rather than in hearsay, the following points are worth noting: 
firstly, this instance of fil is the only one in the Qur'an so there is nothing to cross-reference the word with; secondly, we find 
in this chapter hijarati min sijjil which means - and is rendered as - stones of brimstone. This exact expression occurs twice 
more (at 11:82 and 15:74) and in both instances unequivocally references the people of Lut. We also know that the people of 
Lut are described as lacking 'a right-minded man' among them (11:78). Thus, if we are to judge this chapter on the basis of 
the Qur'anic evidence as opposed to something else,/?/ denotes weak in judgment, base, weak - which we should understand 
as Qur'anic nomenclature for the inhabitants of the city of Lut. 

8871. 105:3 [1], Arabic: tair. This does mean bird (as per the Traditionalist's stories), however the word for bird is simply the 
active participle from tara - to fly and also means flying things, flights and omens.

8875. 106:1 [1], The Traditionalist claims 106:1 to refer to the tribe known as Quraysh and 106:3 to a house used during 
pilgrimage. He may be right; I really cannot say with certainty. And nor can he - at least not on the basis of the Qur’an. 
Certainly the Arabs made pilgrimage to Petra; no such evidence exists for Makkah until well after the Qur'anic revelation. 
Today, Petra is a ruin; its interest is merely historical. The text does not say serve the lord at this house, it says serve the lord of 
this house. One can do that anywhere. Whether the Quraysh tribe pre-existed the Qur'anic revelation or was concocted along 
with the hadith literature afterwards in order to benefit certain people is a question which requires objective historical 
investigation. If you have done such research on the basis of provable facts, please let me know. We do know that various 
groups claimed to be Sabaeans in order to garner privileges under Muslim kings and priesthoods, and that there are 
countless millions more in the world today who claim direct descent from the prophet than can genuinely be the case. Such 
points are of anthropological, social and political interest but do not have a direct bearing on the chapter in question. What 
was of more immediate interest to me is the fact that quraysh means shark (Blackwell Companion to the Qur’an, p. 130, 
Michael Carter, contributor, writes concerning the foreign source of certain words: 'It is only the word quraysh “shark" which 
is traced to Greek [via Syriac][...]’) and that, as recently as the 1980s, it was discovered that many sharks migrate - travelling 
huge distances across oceans in summer and winter - to feed or reproduce; prior to that it was believed that they lived 
regionally. Lastly, bayt - rendered here house - also means family. While it is not a point of doctrine with me, I entertain the 
idea that what is meant is the family (in the generic sense of species ) of the shark. Such thoughts - as with the Traditionalist's 
assertions on this point - are purely speculative, and God knows best.

8881. 107:5 [1], Arabic: salat. I.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salat denotes duty.

8884. 108:1 [1], Arabic: kawthar - abundance. The Traditionalist makes claims for the meaning of kawthar which have no Qur'anic 
basis; the plain meaning of kawthar is as rendered here. 

8885. 108:2 [1], Arabic: s-l-w. I.e. to do such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3, and Article III. Generically, salla means to 
perform duty. In this case - given the preceding context - it would be to give in purity of that which God has given in 
abundance. What God gave the prophet in abundance was that revelation contained in the Qur'an. It is my opinion that this 
chapter serves to encourage the messenger (and those who would follow him) to share this revelation with others. See end 
of Article XX. 

8886. 108:2 [2], Arabic: nahara. This root occurs only once which fact makes it vulnerable to corruption by interested parties. This 
form I verb has come to mean to slaughter, to butcher and it is claimed in the sense of to sacrifice, generally speaking, by the 
Traditionalist to support him in one of his favourite pastimes: killing things. I argue that this meaning has attached itself over 
time. The concept of animal sacrifice is demonstrably alien to the Qur'an as we see '[...JTheir flesh and their food reach not 
God, but the prudent fear reaches him from you[...]’ (22:37). On that basis, it is impossible to consider slaughter or sacrifice the 
meaning here since the text reads 'to thy lord' (which is a natural object for both imperatives in the verse - and the 
Traditionalist typically assumes as much). But God cannot expect one to sacrifice to him that which he has told us does not 
reach him. We must, if we are to be intellectually honest and consistent, look to other accepted meanings for nahara. It has 
two: to master superlatively (which is the sense to which Lane devotes most of his attention); and to do something as soon as 
it becomes due (meanings which both Lane and Badawi-Haleem include). However, since to my mind if one has fully 
mastered something one does it in a timely manner, I feel that to master superlatively includes within it a mastery of time as 
a given, and I render on that basis. 

8887. 108:3 [1], I take this to indicate the shaytan as well as human enemies.

8890. 109:1 [1], Arabic: al kafirun. Typically rendered the unbelievers. See 2:19 and Article Il.iii. This is the only instance where this 
category of person is addressed in the vocative. In my considered opinion, this chapter is generally understood - and thus 
rendered - in a way which strikes a sadly mistaken tone. The dominant assumption - given a wrong value for al kafirun - is 
that those addressed are 'unbelievers’ (i.e. a fundamentally distinct group, one possessed of a wildly different set of beliefs to 
the believers) and that God is directing the messenger to say something along the lines of: you and I have different doctrines, 
so let's just accept the fact. But this is not what is being said; the statement is of an entirely different order. Its purpose is to 
distance the speaker (one who truly believes and whose actions issue forth from that fact) from a group which wears the 
garb of faith - that is, from people who go about as believers but whose actions are not commensurate with such a claim; 
thus, it is making an entirely different point to the one claimed by the Traditionalist; namely: that religion you have - that 
which simulates virtue but which rejects the requisite guidance virtue demands - that is not what I believe (no matter how 
much you might like to have it otherwise).

8899. 111:1 [1], Grammar: dual. In Arabic the word for hand also denotes power, wealth, substance. 

8900. 111:1 [1], Arabic: ‘abu lahab. Lit.: father of flame. The type of person this denotes is made perfectly clear in the chapter. The 
Traditionalist has stories which he attaches to this chapter which have no Qur'anic basis and which I ignore. 

8901. 111:2 [2], I am indebted to Muhammad Asad for the rendering of this verse. 

8902. 111:4 [1], Arabic: hatab - fuel, firewood; tales, slander. Both senses are certainly contained here. 

8903. 111:5 [1], Muhammad Asad comments here: The term masad signifies anything that consists of twisted strands, irrespective of 
the material (Qamus, Mughni, Lisan al-Arab). In the abstract sense in which it is evidently used here, the above phrase seems to 
have a double connotation: it alludes to the woman's twisted, warped nature, as well as to the spiritual truth that "every human

Muhammad Asad, for example, renders freely as the Eternal Uncaused Cause of All Being.

8909. 113:4 [1], I include Muhammad Asad's comment here for interest despite the fact that he appears to treat witchcraft as 
something capable only of imagined results, a position with which I do not agree: [,..]"of those that blow (an-naffathat) upon 
knots": an idiomatic phrase current in pre-Islamic Arabia and, hence, employed in classical Arabic to designate all supposedly 
occult endeavours: it was probably derived from the practice of "witches" and "sorcerers" who used to tie a string into a number 
of knots while blowing upon them and murmuring magic incantations. The feminine gender of naffathat does not, as 
Zamakhshari and Razi point out, necessarily indicate "women ", but may well relate to "human beings" (anfus, sing, nafs, a noun 
that is grammatically feminine).'
